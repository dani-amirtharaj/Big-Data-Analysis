        By Sofia Rizzi
     Alberta ‘Lorelai’ Mosnegutu, born without arms and femurs, wows the judges of Romania’s Got Talent by singing and playing the piano with her feet. Alberta, who goes by the name ‘Lorelai’, was born with a severe disability that restricted the development of her arms and femurs. So when she stepped onto the Romania’s Got Talent stage and declared that she was going to sing and play the piano, one of the judges asked “Excuse me, but how are you going to play the piano?”.  Lorelai simply answered “With my feet.” Her first audition on the Romanian talent show received a standing ovation and the golden buzzer from one of the judges, sending her straight to the live shows. Lorelai went on to win the entire competition with a touching rendition of Rise Like a Phoenix.    When she was born, doctors believed Lorelai would only survive for a matter of days, and her family abandoned her. She was saved by Veronica Parvulescu who cared for Lorelai and encouraged her to sing and play the piano. At only 14, Lorelai has already achieved huge national recognition for her talent and positive outlook on life. She says her motto is “I fall ten times and I rise twenty times”.

        By Helena Asprou
     It’s one of the biggest-selling songs of 2018 and has won a Golden Globe award, so let’s take a closer look at why this hit single has struck a chord Directed by Bradley Cooper and starring pop icon Lady Gaga, A Star Is Born is a heartfelt tale of addiction and doomed love.      The movie tells the story of country singer Jackson Maine (played by Cooper) and struggling songwriter Ally (Gaga), who after a chance encounter quickly form a close bond.    Jackson propels Ally to fame and we’re led to feel hopeful for their future, but their relationship ends in tears as he struggles to fight his inner demons.     Since its release last October, the film and its original soundtrack have been topping charts all over the globe.    Sharing the same name as the movie, the soundtrack album includes the hit song 'Shallow' – a powerful pop ballad performed live on-set by Cooper and Gaga.     So, what is it about this moving melody that gives us all the feels?   This catchy song is the result of an epic collaboration between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga – but the duo’s creativity didn’t stop there.    Producer Mark Ronson, Dirty Pretty Things’ Antonio Rossomando, Miike Snow’s Andrew Wyatt and country music aficionado Lukas Nelson also contributed to the song’s success.    Speaking to Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio, Gaga explained the significance of 'Shallow': “We made this for Ally and Jack. It’s two people talking to each other about the need and the drive to dive into the deep end [of life and love] and stay away from the shallow area.”  Inspired by Eric Clapton, the intro to 'Shallow' is a mellow acoustic guitar riff, providing a stunning musical contrast against Gaga’s mighty vocals later on in the track.     Played at a gentle pace with frequent pauses and a time signature of 4/4, the song is relatively slow to start off with – mimicking the early stages of falling in love when a couple are still unsure of their feelings towards one another.    It lays the groundwork for Bradley Cooper’s raw vocal, which appears in the first verse and complements his lyrics perfectly: “Tell me somethin’ girl, are you happy in this modern world?”     Written in the key of G Major, the repeated rise and fall between notes G and E during: “Is there somethin’ else you’re searching for?” reflect Ally’s ongoing struggle to make it as a musician.     At this point in the movie, Cooper’s character Jackson questions Ally’s ambitions and encourages her to follow her dreams.   Next, we hear Jackson sing:     “I'm fallingIn all the good times I find myselfLongin' for changeAnd in the bad times I fear myself”    Ironically, “I’m falling” is an ascending scale – but the lyric has a double meaning.     Although Jackson is beginning to fall in love with Ally, his hedonistic lifestyle will eventually be his downfall.   Find out more about all the nominees for Best Original Song at this year's Golden Globes >   For verse two, the main melody is repeated but the instrumentation changes – this time with added strings as a cello begins to play on the word ‘void’.    The use of vibrato and sustained notes are intended to add warmth as Ally sees through Jackson’s tough persona, while she asks him: “Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore?”    Then, the refrain reappears but with rich piano chords building texture as both the song and the characters' emotions evolve.    This is where Gaga really gives it some gusto.     Sung forte (loud), the chorus is where we truly appreciate the meaning of this song:    ‘I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive inI'll never meet the groundCrash through the surface, where they can't hurt usWe're far from the shallow now.’    Here, Ally compares falling in love to diving into water. The “deep” end offers hope and potential, whilst the “shallow” end symbolises trouble in her relationship with Jackson – an omen for the film’s heart-breaking ending.     The hard-hitting reality of the story is portrayed in the post-chorus, with repeated lyrics “In the shallow, shallow” sung by both characters, and a descending figure in the main melody reflecting the ebbs and flows of water (and of life).     As the song draws to a close, we hear bass drums kicking in with crashing cymbals to echo Ally’s powerful words: “Crash through the surface”.    This is especially poignant here as before she meets Jackson, Ally is rejected by the music industry over her looks – but now we are reminded that love and talent are more than just skin deep.     'Shallow' won 'Best Original Song' at the Golden Globes, which recognises outstanding achievements in film and took place on Sunday, 6 January at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles.

But on harp, it's truly extraordinary. Over the past few years the Internet has been flooded with covers of Toto's iconic soft rock anthem. And rightly so, it's a great song. Harpist Amy Turk didn't want to be left out, and we’re happy to say that her solo arrangement of the 1982 hit is a belter. Turk takes Toto's melody and tops up that irresistible harmony, then finally polishes it all off with some brilliant (and inventive) percussion. When Amy isn't reworking 1980s soft-rock classics, she does serious harp business with the likes of Bach and Debussy - take a look at her YouTube channel. And here's some Bach...

        By Maddy Shaw Roberts
     From her height and net worth to her performing schedule, here's everything you need to know about Russian operatic soprano and rising star Aida Garifullina. Aida Garifullina is a Russian soprano, born in 1987 Kazan, the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan. She is best known for having performed 'Angels' with Robbie Williams at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Moscow, and she currently has a recording contract with Decca Records. Aida is also known for singing her signature aria 'Je veux vivre' from Gounod's Roméo et Juliette. At just 31 years old, she has a net worth of $1 million, and she is five feet five inches tall.  Aida studied with the renowned tenor Siegfried Jerusalem in Nuremberg, before making her debut at the Mariinsky Theatre in January 2013. The Financial Times described her as a “major new talent”. Aida had her first big break in the same year, when she won Plácido Domingo’s Operalia competition. Since then, she has performed in some of the world’s most impressive opera houses, including Vienna State Opera (where she is a regular performer) and Wigmore Hall. The Times called her “the songbird from Kazan with the world at her feet”.   As well as having duetted with some of the greatest opera stars, including Plácido Domingo and Andrea Bocelli, Aida appeared in the 2016 film Florence Foster Jenkins with Meryl Streep. She made a cameo appearance as the 20th-century soprano and actress Lily Pons, singing ‘The Bell Song’ – the famous aria from the opera Lakmé, which also features ‘The Flower Duet’. Aida was cast by director Stephen Frears himself, who is apparently a fan of hers. Her scene was filmed at the Hammersmith Apollo, London, which was transformed to look like New York’s Carnegie Hall. Aida Garifullina features in a song on Andrea Bocelli’s new album Sì. ‘Ave Maria Pietas’ is a beautiful duet for soprano and tenor which marks the pair’s first official release.  The pair have, however, performed together in concert before, singing Andrea Bocelli’s well-known hit ‘Con te partirò’ (Time to Say Goodbye).  The 31-year-old soprano is one of today’s most popular Instagram opera stars, with 520,000 followers. Aida revealed that she gained 20,000 Instagram followers in less than 24 hours, following her appearance with Robbie Williams at the FIFA World Cup in Moscow where the pair performed Robbie's song 'Angels'. She told the Press Association: “It’s amazing, I see on social media so many pictures and videos of our performance with Robbie and I gained 20,000 followers today on Instagram and it’s a sign that people really, really loved and enjoyed that performance.” With 2 Legends 😍🌟🌟🌟#worldcup pic.twitter.com/4e8l4MsBkU On top of a busy schedule filled with concert and opera performances, Aida will make her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 2019.

     From presenting hit TV show Ground Force to narrating Classic FM’s album The Glorious Garden, here’s everything you need to know about Britain’s favourite gardener   He’s one of Classic FM’s best-loved presenters and a British TV legend – Alan Titchmarsh has had a very fruitful career since starting out as a young gardening apprentice.     Born on 2 May, 1949, Alan grew up in Ilkley, Yorkshire with his mother Bessie, a textile mill worker and Alan Sr., a plumber, before moving to Shipley aged 18 to study horticulture.     After training at Hertfordshire College of Agriculture and Horticulture and the prestigious Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, he decided to become a gardening journalist and hasn’t looked back since.    From working as an expert on Nationwide to hosting the Chelsea Flower Show, Alan has always been passionate about sharing his love of horticulture with the British public.     He was also a presenter on the Antiques Roadshow, religious programme Songs of Praise and nature documentary series, British Isles – A Natural History.  However, he became a household name as part of the presenting team on hit gardening show Ground Force – a garden makeover TV series – alongside Charlie Dimmock and Tommy Walsh.     This Sunday, 17 March at 6pm, you can watch Alan sing in ITV’s spectacular one-off TV show, All Star Musicals, hosted by John Barrowman and taking place at the London Palladium.     Other celebrities performing songs from their favourite musicals include money-saving expert Martin Lewis, Tessa Peake Jones (from Only Fools and Horses), I’m a Celeb winner and comedian Joel Dommett, Coronation Street actor Daniel Brocklebank and Emmerdale actress Amy Walsh.    As well as being a hit with TV audiences, Alan has also penned several books, including fiction novel Only Dad, a series of gardening guides and his autobiography, When I Was A Nipper.  In 2012, he turned his hand to music and joined Classic FM as a presenter and he now presents every Saturday morning, 7-10am.     Last year, he collaborated on an album with Classic FM’s composer in residence Debbie Wiseman on which all of the pieces were inspired by poems written by Alan.      The beautiful (and often humorous) poems are all about his favourite plants and flowers, and he narrates them alongside  music performed by the National Symphony Orchestra.

Hymns from King'sChoir of King's College, Cambridge/Stephen CleoburyKings College KGS0014 Covering the entire church year including Christmas and Easter, this sumptuous collection features some of the world’s most popular hymns as they're sung at King’s College, arranged by choral master Stephen Cleobruy. The album was recorded by candlelight in the choir stalls of the college and the unique atmosphere and feeling is evident throughout the album. It's also fascinating to see some of the great composers whose tunes are used in these hymns, ranging from Handel to Vaughan Williams.

Brahms: Works for Solo Piano, Vol.6Barry DouglasChandos CHAN 10903 This is the sixth and final volume in Barry Douglas’s marvellous survey of Brahms’s works for solo piano, which started four years ago and now encompasses almost five hours of music. The pieces recorded here span the entirety of Brahms's career, from March 1852 (the Study after Weber) – 18 months before the life-changing meeting between Brahms and Robert and Clara Schumann – to August 1893 (the Intermezzo, Op. 118 No. 6) – less than four years before the composer's death. Here's a chance to hear Brahms's full range of skills – as composer, arranger and virtuoso pianist – which Barry Douglas embraces perfectly. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Franz Xaver Mozart/Muzio Clementi: Piano ConcertosHoward Shelley/Sinfonieorchester St GallenHyperion CDA68126  Franz Xaver Mozart (1791-1844) was born just four months before Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s death, so he didn’t know his celebrated father. His mother Constanze pushed him really hard to have a career as a travelling virtuoso, trading under the name W.A.Mozart Jnr. Naturally, Franz Xaver did not find the burden of being Mozart’s son easy, but he had a decent enough career, though he was only modestly successful artistically and commercially. These two piano concertos are entertaining enough to be listened to on their own merits. The first was composed in 1809, when he was only 18, and is scored for a full classical orchestra minus clarinets. The second dates from 1818 and is more complex. I will be playing the last movement of that in my Sunday evening programme in a couple of weeks time. Muzio Clementi (1752–1832) was born in Rome, but was brought to England by a wealthy MP in 1767. He made a considerable reputation in London as a composer, keyboard virtuoso, and in later life as a celebrated teacher. His piano concerto dates from 1796, and is diverting, even if not much more than that. This is the beginning of a Hyperion series called The Classical Piano Concerto, and if they dig up more rarities like these, it will be most welcome. Longstanding Hyperion Artist Howard Shelley rattles off these concertos as if to the manner born, and also directs a new one on me, the St Gallen Symphony Orchestra from Switzerland. Order from iTunes >Order from Amazon >  Sol Gabetta: CelloSol Gabetta/Various ArtistsSony 88985342962Sol Gabetta is an exceptional young cellist, and this is an exceptional compilation of the work she has done in the recording studio so far in her short career. In addition to Elgar's evergreen Cello Concerto, here are also some Elgar salon works, and a couple of really worthwhile short pieces by Dvorak: Silent Woods and the Rondo. The second album is mainly given over to short encore pieces such as, inevitably, Saint-Saens's The Swan, and less obviously, Pablo Casals's beautiful reworking of a Catalan folk song, The Song of the Birds. Truly exceptional, and no cello lover should miss this. The album, released on Friday 1 July, gets a first play on my programme next Sunday 10 July, 7pm. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Sibelius: Symphonies 3, 6 & 7Minnesota Orchestra/Osmo VänskäBIS 2006 It was nip and tuck as to whether to make this the album of the week rather than the Howard Shelley above. He got it for rarity value, whereas the merits of Vänskä’s Sibelius are well known. This new cycle with the Minnesota Orchestra, of which Vänskä has been Music Director since 2003, has been a long time coming, because of various traumas the orchestra has gone through in prolonged battles with its management and employers. Accordingly, though some parts of the cycle emerged four years ago, with Nos. 2 and 5 winning the best Classical Music Recording 2012 from The New York Times, and the next album containing Symphonies No. 1 and 4, winning a Grammy for Best Orchestral Performance two years later. These recordings were made a year ago, and will surely do equally well. The orchestra plays brilliantly, its sound is well captured by the BIS engineers, and Vänskä is, if anything, even more authoritative than usual. A real winner. Sibelius fans don’t hesitate, not just for the quality of the performances, but the exceptional value offered by this album, with three symphonies on it, extending to 82 minutes. Now you see why I moan that some CDs are still being issued with only just over 50 minutes of music on them. You’re being cheated out of half an hour!Buy from Amazon > Debussy/Takemitsu: Works for stringsScottish Ensemble/Jonathan MortonLINN CKD512 As is the case actually on this next album, which runs for only 55 minutes. The reason for getting it though is the opportunity it gives to appreciate some rarely heard music. The main piece here is Jonathan Morton’s arrangement for strings of Debussy’s String Quartet. Morton is the Artistic Director and leader of the Scottish Ensemble, and they give a good account of themselves here. I'm not sure though that I don’t prefer the original by quite a wide margin. But the fillers include three pieces by Toru Takemitsu (1930-1996), an eclectic Japanese composer, who could write very difficult music, but also some accessible stuff, including guitar arrangements of Beatles tunes. For those who want something a bit more challenging than the norm, this is worth hearing – perhaps at least download the Takemitsu pieces. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > W.A. Mozart: Three Salzburg Symphonies – Nos. 21, 27, 34Haydn Sinfonietta Wien/Manfred HussBIS 2218Having begun with a Mozart, let's end with one. This time, the 'real' one – Wolfgang Amadeus, caught for the most part in this album in his teens, which he spent in Salzburg. Given how popular Mozart is, its extraordinary how little of his music we actually know. He wrote at least 41 symphonies, but of those only the last five or six have truly captured the public imagination. And a lot of the early ones are never done at all. For instance, Nos. 21 and 27, featured here, were composed when he was 16-17. You get a good performance here from the Viennese original instrument band the Haydn Sinfonietta in recordings made in 2006, and originally issued on another label. To bulk up the duration, and make it more interesting is the newly recorded No. 34, composed in Salzburg when Mozart was in his mid-twenties. And they have added a minuet (K409) to give the symphony a proper four-movement feel, as was the case in Mozart’s day.

Ola Gjeilo: Voices Piano StrigsTenebrae/Voces8Decca 478868 Gjeilo’s major debut release album gives the Norwegian composer the opportunity to display his brand of ethereal, contemporary choral music which has wide appeal. Indeed, the track Tundra made it into the 2016 Classic FM Hall of Fame after being championed by Aled Jones. Radiant vocal textures - provided here by the excellent ensembles Tenebrae and Voces8 - are enhanced by transcendental instrumental additions; a twinkling piano performed by Gjeilo himself; captivating, exquisite strings; and bewitching acoustic guitar. He describes his music as “a lyrical mix of improvisation and classical”, and others often describe it as “cinematic… evocative, lush, story-telling…” It's well worth discovering.

John Ireland: Music for String OrchestraRaphael Wallfisch/Orchestra of the Swan/David CurtisNaxos 8.571372 John Ireland’s music is often inspired by landscape and romantic sensitivities. With its significant musical clues, broad, songlike melodies and turbulent finale, the Sonata in G minor is one of his most expressive and passionate works. A Downland Suite is one of Ireland’s most attractive compositions, especially its exquisite Elegy and popular Minuet made familiar through its use in radio and television. Ireland’s evocative piano works lend themselves well to string orchestra arrangements. They include the exquisite miniature Soliloquy and In a May Morning, the second movement of Sarnia, inspired by spring on Guernsey. Here's a composer who is due for serious rediscovery. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Chopin: Ballades/Berceuse/MazurkasYundiDeutsche Grammophon DG 4812443 Back in 2000 whilst still a teenager, the Chinese pianist Yundi Li was the youngest ever winner of the prestigious International Chopin Competition in Warsaw. Since then he has dropped his second name, so he sounds like a Premier League midfielder (bad), but further refined his Chopin technique to produce a deeply satisfying album of some of the Polish master’s finest inspirations (good). The four Ballades, were written over almost a decade. Each requires, and gets from Yundi, a sophisticated combination of power and poetry. I especially liked number four where Yundi displays real mastery of Chopin’s idiom. Yundi is nothing like as well-known as his Chinese contemporary, Lang Lang, but is an infinitely more subtle player. Lang Lang in his recent Chopin album, used some of Chopin’s finest music merely to display his virtuosity, in a way best described as self-indulgent narcissism.Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Stokowski TranscriptionsTimothy Walden/Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra/José SerebrierNaxos 8578305 In the mid noughties José Serebrier and the BSO garnered three much sought after Grammy nominations for a series of recordings of orchestral music transcribed by the great conductor Leopold Stokowski (1882-1977). Serebrier was Stokowski’s assistant for several years in the 1960s, and Stokowski thought really highly of him both as a composer – he premiered and recorded several of Serebrier’s pieces – and as a conductor. In these recordings, Serebrier returns the favour with some marvellous stuff that makes for thoroughly entertaining listening. Things like the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, with which the Stokowski-inspired Disney film Fantasia famously began. Then there’s quieter stuff, like a touching transcription of Purcell’s Lament from his semi-opera Dido and Aeneas. Buy from Amazon >   The Truly Unforgettable Voice of Florence Foster JenkinsRCA 88985319622 Mystic Mellor confidently predicts an American soprano called Florence Foster Jenkins will become an overnight success next month. Always a remarkable achievement, but especially so here, because Madame Jenkins has been dead for 71 years. So why this Lazarus-like revival?  Well, courtesy of Meryl Streep and director Stephen Frears, she is about to fill the silver screen with carefully coiffed hair, generous embonpoint, and a voice the like of which, I swear you will have never experienced before. FFJ was born to wealth, but not to music. She arrived at opera courtesy of dad’s money, a divorce from an unsuitable husband, who, the movie advises, kindly infected her with syphilis on their wedding night, when she was 18, and an unquenchable enthusiasm for life, opera, and generosity to friends whether deserving or not. As the movie brilliantly portrays, she frequented the playgrounds of the rich from New York to Newport, and would several times a season gather her most loyal admirers - and there were a lot, plus, of course, cynical freeloaders – to listen to her sing favourite arias and songs. Thankfully, towards the end of her life she recorded eight items, which now reappear at bargain price. The earlier issue I have treasured for 25 years was entitled The Glory (????) of the Human Voice, and that just about sums it up. With of course, a photo of Madame Jenkins on the cover, heavily corseted, in a flowing silk gown, with a large pair of angel wings attached, grimacing at the camera. They say every picture tells a story – this one is worth 10,000 words from me, or anyone else for that matter, in describing the FFJ experience. As for the singing, well suffice to say, 'Adele’s Laughing Song' from Die Fledermaus is no laughing matter. And the end of 'The Bell Song' is indescribable, except that, if I happened upon a cage of gerbils having sex, at the height of their passion they must surely sound like this. As for Adele’s shrieks and squawks at the end of the Laughing Song, victims of axe murderers have gone more quietly than Madame Jenkins. And yet you will love this film. Indeed I shed a tear at her death scene with more sincerity than I usually do for such stuff at the Opera House. Buy from Amazon > Herbert Howells: Collegium Regale and other choral worksChoir of Trinity College Cambridge/Stephen LaytonHyperion CDA68105 Herbert Howells was arguably the most important composer of music for the Anglican church in the mid-twentieth century, and this selection has all of the polish and charisma to be expected from one of Britain’s most accomplished choral conductors, Stephen Layton, and his excellent Cambridge Choir, which now rivals the far more famous Kings College Choir in its achievements. Some of this stuff will be a bit austere for general listeners, but there’s much to enjoy here, notably the little anthem composed by Howells for the Coronation of our present Queen. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Brahms: Piano Quintet/String Quartet No.1Natacha Kudritskaya/Brodsky QuartetChandos CHAN10892 The Brodskys, with the odd change in personnel, continue in business with this excellent album, where they are joined for the piano quintet by the Russian pianist Natacha Kudritskaya. This Quintet is a real crowd pleaser that never, it seems to me, ever gets put in front of all the crowds it could please. In other words, it’s a bit of a hidden gem, and certainly seems so in the eloquent performance here. In fact, the Brahms Quintet is not only tuneful and engaging, but also a trailblazer. Its distinguished predecessor, Schubert’s Trout, features a pianist, a string trio and a double bass. This was the way piano quintets were before Brahms, who was the first to use a string quartet, with the usual second violin substituting for the double bass. After the success of the Brahms, that became the model for future piano quintets like those by Dvorak and Shostakovich. Many people find Brahms string quartets unappealing, because they are not full of errand boys whistles, i.e, there’s nothing to hum after you’ve heard them. But this one is well worth hearing for those prepared to give it their full attention.

Haydn's music has been overshadowed by that of his older brother and, while he never reaches the sublime heights of brother Joseph or indeed Mozart, J.M.'s music is nevertheless worth exploring as lively, jovial eighteenth century classical music. The four symphonies collected here span just over a decade, from the graceful combination of elegance and liveliness of the Sinfonia in D, the muted violins in the Adagietto affettuoso of the Sinfonia in E flat, the lovely sicilienne of the Sinfonia in B flat to the substantial Sinfonia in F, featuring a violin and cor anglais playing together or in alternation. The music is performed in a lively and relaxed style by a fine ensemble from the Czech Republic, directed by the flautist Patrick Gallois.Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > David Mellor's Album Reviews will return next month.

Coates was born the son of a doctor in Nottinghamshire. Fortunately the family was musical, and he was encouraged to learn the violin and the viola, and later earned his living as a viola player in Sir Henry Wood’s orchestra. Having beaten off his father’s well intentioned efforts to get him into a secure job as a bank clerk, Coates did well, first in the orchestra, and then as a composer. Sir Henry Wood soon noticed his talent, and played a Coates piece as long ago as 1911. After the First World War neuritis affected his bowing arm, and so he became a full time composer.  Happily, this coincided with the rise of radio, and the emergence of 78rpm discs. Radio shows were desperate for signature tunes, and one of Coates’s most famous pieces, the Knightsbridge March, the final section of his London Everyday Suite, became famous throughout the country. Also, Coates was a miniaturist. Even when he wrote orchestral suites, they would consist of three short 3-5 minutes pieces, so could fit readily on a 78rpm side. After the War, and the emergence of the LP, and the arrival of television, Eric Coates’s cause slumped somewhat. But now, we are ready I believe for a Coates revival. The Dambusters March is back in our Hall of Fame, and other Coates pieces are being regularly played.  Coates was a superb craftsman, and a brilliant melodist. And a combination of a great tune beautifully orchestrated is often irresistible, as you will hear. On Saturday I am playing some of Coates’s finest inspirations. If that whets your appetite to buy an album, there’s quite a lot to choose from. But if you want a modern well-recorded survey of some of Coates’s finest music, including the London Again Suite, this Chandos album conducted by Ruman Gamba is a safe bet. Chandos CHAN 9869Buy from Amazon >Download from iTunes >Leroy Anderson Orchestral Works BBC Concert Orchestra/Leonard SlatkinAnderson was a remarkable man.  A brilliant linguist, he could have earned his living as an interpreter, and indeed spent 4 years during WWII interpreting Northern European languages - he spoke 6 – to senior American officers. But all the while he was pursuing his other career as a composer of light music, and as an arranger for the Boston Pops, a job he had held down since 1936, when Arthur Fiedler spotted his exceptional talent while Anderson was still studying at Harvard. Next Saturday’s programme aims to show the best of Leroy Anderson. I start with some of his finest original orchestral pieces, like Belle of the Ball, and the ubiquitous Sleigh Ride, and then move on to Anderson the arranger.  Amongst many joys there, is a Gershwin pot Pourri, which was one of the last recordings ever made by Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops, in the year of his death, 1979.  There’s also a surprisingly successful arrangement of Handel’s Where’er you Walk, called the Song of Jupiter, and a riotous Old McDonald Had A Farm, complete with a battery of farmyard noises. Anderson was a remarkable melodist, arguably the finest orchestral arranger of the 20th century, and a dedicated craftsman, who would spend ages over each one of his miniatures. Almost anything could inspire him.  A workman using sandpaper, led to the Sandpaper Ballet.  And the noise made by a typewriter - a rarity today – also makes for an enchanting couple of minutes. If you want to experience the best of Leroy Anderson, any one of these five Leonard Slatkin Naxos albums will work well for you.  And buying the whole lot will bring a lifetime of listening pleasure.Volume OneNaxos 8.559313 Buy from Amazon >Download from iTunes > Volume TwoNaxos 8.559356 Buy from Amazon >Download from iTunes > Volume ThreeNaxos 8.559357Buy from Amazon >Download from iTunes > Volume FourNaxos 8.559381Buy from Amazon >Download from iTunes > Volume FiveNaxos 8.559382 Buy from Amazon >Download from iTunes > The Lighter ElgarNorthern Sinfonia Orchestra / Neville MarrinerWarners The fourth of my Light Music Masters series (Saturday 25th June) features Elgar. Elgar wrote light music from the age of ten until just a few months before he died, when he orchestrated his tribute to his Cairn terrier, Mina, with which I will end this programme. Elgar used light music to make money, but it was also an important part of his musical expression. For instance, Mina is surely not about a lively little dog, but reflects Elgar’s nostalgia, and, I suspect self-pity as his life draws towards its close. He also wrote light music to make money.  Elgar was chronically short of dosh throughout his whole career.  Composers make no money out of symphonies, but they could make money, if they were good at it, out of writing miniatures for violin and piano etc for domestic performance.  Elgar did that throughout his long career, as the programme will show. One of Elgar’s finest light music inspirations, Salut d'Amour, was composed in 1888 as a love gift to his fiancée Caroline Alice Roberts, the daughter of an Indian army General, 9 years older than him, but a great helpmate to this chronically insecure musician. It’s a great tune, as many people will already know.  Sadly Elgar didn’t do well out of it;  he sold it outright to his publisher for a few pounds, when, if he’d kept the copyright, he could have lived comfortably on the proceeds of that piece alone for the rest of his long life. Elgar’s light music has been recorded by a number of outstanding Elgar conductors, notably Sir Adrian Boult.  But if you want it on a single CD, I strongly recommend Neville Marriner’s survey with the Northern Sinfonia, Classic FM’s orchestra in the North East and at the Sage, Gateshead.  Neville has the measure of this music, the orchestra play beautifully for him, and although the album is now some decades old, it still sounds well.Buy from Amazon >Download from iTunes >  Strauss: New Year's Concert in Vienna 1987Wiener Philharmoniker/Herbert Von KarajanDG Every year the New Year’s Day Concert is issued, mainly by Decca/DG, but now by Sony.  It’s always a good listen, never more so than the one conducted by Herbert Von Karajan in 1987.  Karajan was an Austrian, born in Salzburg, who recorded Strauss Family pieces throughout his career, but never better than at this New Year’s Day Concert, the only one he did. He was able to use his unique authority to lecture the audience about not fidgeting during the beautiful introductions to the big tunes in some of the Strauss waltzes.  And he’s right; Brahms himself admired Johann Strauss IIs orchestral writing. The penultimate programme in my six part Light Music Masters series features the Strauss Family, and other Viennese composers, and includes what is, for me, the highlight of this 1987 concert, Johann Strauss IIs Voices of Spring, featuring the American coloratura Kathy Battle, who sings most beautifully. In this programme I am featuring Johann Strauss I, with a splendid rarity, a waltz sequence written for Queen Victoria’s first State Ball, and the first major occasion at the newly refurbished Buckingham Palace in 1838, which begins with Rule Britannia, and ends with the National Anthem. Each of his three musical sons Johann II, Josef, and Eduard has a piece, as well as a wonderful overture The Light Cavalry, by the inventor of Viennese operetta, Franz von Suppe.  I also feature my favourite Viennese waltz, Franz Lehar’s Gold and Silver Waltz and two operetta extracts, sung by La Stupenda herself, the late, lamented, Dame Joan Sutherland.   Buy from Amazon >Download from iTunes > David Mellor is Opera and Classical Critic of the Mail on Sunday and presenter of his own show on Classic FM, Sundays 7pm.

61,classicfm.com/discover-music/,classical,https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/album-reviews/14-february-2016/," Every week our albums guru David Mellor reviews the best of the new releases and reissues, and features two of them in his Sunday show at 7pm.   CRITIC'S CHOICE Astor Piazzolla: Tango!Isabelle van Keulen EnsembleChallenge Classics CC72610 Isabelle van Keulen is an exceptional violinist, as I prove on my show this Sunday, with her recently recorded performance of the slow movement of Beethoven’s Spring Sonata, and next Sunday, with her participation in the finale of Schubert’s Octet. She’s also a devotee of Astor Piazzolla and the tango, and this new album makes a powerful case for Piazzolla as a fascinating figure who straddled popular South American dance, jazz, and serious classical music. On Sunday’s show I am playing Soledad and Bando, both extremely attractive pieces that don’t outstay their welcome. Elsewhere on this album, van Keulen and her colleagues explore Piazzolla in more recondite mood, building up a picture of a complex musician for whom the tango was a starting point. But it was never the end, rather a stimulus to producing music of real depth and substance; it reflected his many years of training as a classical musician, as well as all the work he did as a bandoneon player in nightclubs in both Argentina and New York. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > BEST OF THE REST Korngold and Britten: Violin ConcertosVilde Frang/Frankfurt Radio Symphony/James GaffiganWarner Classics 2564600921 Frang is the latest in a long line of young violinists who have taken up Korngold’s exhilarating concerto, based on his 1930s Hollywood music, and once denounced as more “Korn than Gold”. Actually, it’s a beautiful piece, with great tunes, well laid out for the violin, and wonderfully orchestrated, as befits a composer who as a child was described by both Mahler and Richard Strauss as more talented than the boy Mozart.  The coupling, appropriately, is the Benjamin Britten concerto, composed around the same time, and that, with Samuel Barber’s concerto, constitutes a trio of outstanding and accessible mid-twentieth century violin concertos, from composers who refused to be driven down the blind alley of atonalism. My major regret is that the Barber isn’t included, when there would have been room for it, just about. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >   Ludomir Różycki – Piano Concertos/BalladeJonathan Plowright/BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra/Lukasz BorowiczHyperion CDA68066 Hyperion’s invaluable Romantic Piano Concerto series has reached volume 67, and this Różycki album is a real winner as those who listened to the Ballade last Sunday will already know.  And I was grateful for a number of warm messages from listeners to whom Różycki was a new name, just as he was to me. Ludomir Różycki (1883-1953) was a Polish academic who wrote music that was backward looking to the end of the 19th century, but still well worth listening to because of some fresh musical ideas, great tunes, fine virtuoso piano writing and orchestration.  In other words, a thoroughly professional, and often inspired job. Jonathan Plowright plays really well throughout, and for those who missed last Sunday’s show, why not download the Ballade, as a quick ten minute way of getting to know a composer who on this evidence should not be so neglected. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >   Decca SoundOrchestre Symphonique de Montréal/Charles DutoitDecca 4789466 Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony were an important part of Decca’s offering from 1980-2000, so it’s a serious joy that all 35 of the albums they made together during that period have been packaged up and offered at such an attractive price.  (£55.99 for 35CDs, maybe less on the net.) Amongst the many joys here, there are complete Ravel and Debussy orchestral music sets, and all three of Tchaikovsky’s big ballets.  Dutoit and his band specialised in colourful music, so there are also vivid performances of well know stuff by Bizet, Falla, Respighi, and Rimsky-Korsakov, as well as less well known, but endearing music by Jacques Ibert, Piazzolla again, and some vividly performed overtures by Suppe. I shall shortly be devoting a Sunday show to this box, because the music here is so accessible, so well performed, and so well recorded, that almost everything here could have been made yesterday afternoon.Buy from Amazon >   Scriabin: Piano MusicSoyeon Kate LeeNaxos 8573527 Better late than never, I suppose, is the right reaction to this album.  Scriabin’s centenary after all was last year, and these recordings were made back in June 2013. But they are still welcome as an unhackneyed selection of some of Scriabin’s less well known piano music, all of it approachable, and all very competently played by the young Korean/American pianist Soyeon Kate Lee. At 51 minutes, this is short weight by Naxos standards, but, at bargain price, it’s perfectly acceptable as an introduction to a crazy composer, who thought he was God, but knew how to play the piano, and how to compose effectively for it, and who died all too young, aged only 43, from blood poisoning as a result of an insect bite. Not the right way for a God to die, was it?

Zubin Mehta conducts Brahms New York Philharmonic/BrahmsSony 88875123012 “I became a conductor”, Zubin Mehta once wrote, “because deep down I wanted to conduct Brahms’s four symphonies and Richard Strauss’s tone poems.” To celebrate Mehta's 80th birthday this year, Sony Classical has released for the first time on CD Mehta’s Brahms cycle which appeared on LP between 1979 and 1984. Every item in this 8-album collection – featuring facsimile LP sleeves and labels, plus full notes – has been newly remastered from the original tapes, bringing these superlative performances to a new generation. A fitting tribute to a musical giant.Buy from Amazon > After 6pm each weekday evening, John Brunning showcases a track from his Drive Discovery, a fantastic new release. Handel: Trio Sonatas for two violins and basso continuoThe Brook Street BandAvie AV2357The Brook Street Band celebrates its 20th anniversary as a leading light and champion of the music of Handel with another imaginative album that completes their survey of Handel's Trio Sonatas for violins and continuo. One special bonus here is an arrangement for two violins and basso continuo of the overture to Handel's oratorio Esther.Buy from Amazon > Elgar: Symphony No.1Staatskapelle Berlin/Daniel BarenboimDecca 4789353 It’s been a splendid spring for new issues of great British music, and I'm playing extracts from two of them in my show this Sunday from 7pm – Elgar’s Serenade in a fine new performance by the RPO under Pinchas Zukerman, and Michael Collins playing two of Gerald Finzi’s Bagatelles for clarinet, in their orchestral version. And now here’s another one, that some will think is the best yet; Daniel Barenboim’s new recording, with his Berlin band, the Staatskapelle, of Elgar’s First Symphony. Barenboim not only understands this music, but obviously loves it, and this is a performance that shows him and his orchestra – surely now better than the Berlin Philharmonic – with their supple strings and burnished brass at, or near, their best. Though, let it be said, they are not in any sense in a different class to some of the London orchestras, who have given really terrific performances of this symphony over the years. This is a self-recommending issue.Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Igor Stravinsky: Three Great BalletsBBC Symphony/New York Philharmonic/Cleveland Orchestra/Pierre BoulezSony Classical Masters 88697714372 In The Firebird, Petrouchka and The Rite of Spring, premiered between 1910 and 1913, Stravinsky shook up the musical world, moving seemingly effortlessly from romanticism into the entirely new musical universe of the 20th century, without having to resort to the atonalism of the Second Viennese School. (Though later he did, rather unsuccessfully.) Though this album is short weight, at barely 90 minutes over two CDs, and the recordings are all over 40 years old, at the price it is still a worthwhile purchase, because Pierre Boulez had such authority in this kind of music. His objectivity and rigour, ensures The Firebird is never too opulent, and the violence in The Rite of Spring superbly controlled. Buy from Amazon > The Art of Murray PerahiaSony 88875183392  This box is a serious snip at £19.99, or maybe less if you shop around on the net. You get 10 of the finest piano albums of the last 40 years, including perhaps the best ever recordings of Mendelssohn’s lightweight but fun Piano Concertos, as well as outstanding performances of Chopin’s two Concertos, and a Chopin recital built around the 4 Ballades from 1994 – that’s one of my all-time favourites.Buy from Amazon >  The Captive NightingaleElena Xanthoudakis/Jason Xanthoudakis/Clemens LeskeSignum SIGCD398 The Australian coloratura Elena Xanthoudakis is currently touring the country with English Touring Opera in a fascinating Donizetti rediscovery Pia de’ Tolomei, where she makes quite an impact as the tragic Pia. This album was recorded in 2010 in her homeland, but has not been previously released here. It’s full of good things from early-mid 19th century Germany, some familiar like Schubert’s Shepherd on the Rock, but most not, like the title song, Heinrich Proch’s The Captive Nightingale. Her partners, her brother Jason on the clarinet, and Clemens Leske at the piano, work well with her, and together they have produced an off-the-beaten-track album that will please any discriminating canary fanciers.Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Deutsche Grammophon: The Mono Era 1948-1957DG 4795516 The great thing about collecting CDs, or downloading classical music, is that you don’t have to stick with the music making of today, good though a lot of it is, but can roam freely over more than a century of recorded sound, picking up on a host of artists no longer with us, who had something really special to say about the music they recorded. And this 51-CD box is full to the brim of stuff like that. Pianists such as Wilhelm Kempff and Sviatoslav Richter in Schumann, for instance, or the great violinist David Oistrakh, partnered by his son Igor, in some captivating display pieces. Conductors including Wilhelm Furtwangler in Schubert and Haydn, and Karl Bohm in Brahms, have real authority. Good also to hear two albums featuring the tragically short lived Ferenc Fricsay, a really major talent.  I also always enjoyed the long lived Eugen Jochum, who I saw a lot live in London, and featured here in some enticing Mozart. I can’t go on like this, but I will also mention a captivating performance by Kurt Sanderling, who also went on until near his 90th birthday, and was a regular visitor to London, with the Leningrad Philharmonic back in 1956, in an irreplaceable, idiomatic performance of Rachmaninov’s Second Symphony. The sound on all these albums is almost always good, and often very good. The ear soon adjusts to mono sound, and this is seriously unmissable listening. So much so, I shall be devoting a Sunday programme to this box in May.Buy from Amazon > David Mellor is Opera and Classical Critic of the Mail on Sunday and presenter of his own show on Classic FM, Sundays 7pm.

The suite is full of stirring themes and fine brass playing, reflecting various aspects of Her Majesty's life including musical evocations of Buckingham Palace, Royal Ascot, Sandringham and Windsor.

Love & Friendship - Original SoundtrackDianne Marshall (harp)/Irish Film Orchestra/Mark SuozzoSony Classics This is music from the new film Love & Friendship, based on a Jane Austen novella Lady Susan. The story was written between 1793 and 1805 but its producers opted for music from an earlier period which seemed to better reflect the spirit of the piece. Handel, Purcell, Boyce, Mozart, Vivaldi and other composers of the era are included here alongside Paris-based composer Benjamin Esdraffo who wrote additional tracks, including the opening titles’ harp theme and Baroque-style incidental music. A feast for the ears as well as the eyes. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >    Légende: Works for Trumpet and PianoAlison Balsom/Tom PosterWarner Classics 9029598772 Alison Balsom is the poster girl of British classical music, and one of the world’s finest trumpeters. She promotes a remarkable range of music, from traditional favourites to cutting edge contemporary, as well as acting as an ambassador for music education for all, which she is not alone in thinking is in serious decline in the UK. This new album contains a remarkable range of music, and, though I think it’s a winner, not everything will suit everybody. For great tune enthusiasts, Balsom and her indefatigable pianist, Tom Poster – with whom she has worked for more than a decade now – dish up quality arrangements of two big items from the 'Great American Songbook', Gershwin’s Someone to Watch Over Me, and Jerome Kern’s The Way You Look Tonight. Thoroughly entertaining, but quite a lot more challenging, is Jean Françaix’s perky Sonatine, Georges Enescu’s Légende, and Alexander Gaudicke’s Concert Etude. Then, as you come up for air mid-listen, there’s a charming arrangement of the late, lamented Peter Maxwell Davies’s Farewell to Stromness. Not for the faint hearted are two names in my shudder zone:  Paul Hindemith and Bohuslav Martinů. But the Martinů is actually quite engaging, and the Hindemith Sonata, though typically overlong, has its moments. So, if you want to push the envelope, and move a bit out of your comfort zone, this is one for you. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Live from Lugano 2015Martha Argerich and FriendsWarner 2564628549 As part of my campaign for chamber music, let me strongly recommend the latest in an ongoing series of recordings from Martha Argerich's Festival in Lugano. This one offers 3½ hours of music, of considerable variety, featuring Argerich, and a number of her disciples; musicians of great distinction like the cellist Gautier Capuçon, the pianist Nicholas Angelich, the clarinettist Paul Meyer, the violinist Ilya Gringolts and many others. Argerich, one of the finest pianists of our time, has had her issues as a performing artist. For decades she didn’t play solo recitals because of nerves, and has also had recurrent bouts of cancer. These problems have added to her legendary status and meant that when more than a decade ago she set up the Lugano Festival, young artists flocked there for the opportunity to play with her. What you get is an extraordinary mixture of mainstream pieces including Brahms's Clarinet Trio and one of his piano trios, with more off the wall stuff like Ferdinand Ries’s Piano Quartet, and Turino’s Piano Trio. There's also always something interesting for piano duo, or for two pianos, notably this time, Debussy’s En Blanc et Noir, where Argerich is joined by one of her oldest friends, the outstanding London based pianist Stephen Kovacevich. A three album set well worth exploring, particularly since it is extremely well recorded technically. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > John Field: NocturnesEwa PoblockaFrederick Chopin Institute NIFCCD102 The Frederick Chopin Institute produces a series of scholarly recordings with excellent notes, about Chopin and his contemporaries and influences. They have now reached the Irish Pianist John Field (1782-1837) who travelled widely in Eastern Europe, and who some think influenced a major part of Chopin’s output, the Nocturnes, by inventing the form. Life is never quite as simple as that is it, and the liner notes open up the possibility that Field did not invent the Nocturne, nor did Chopin learn about them from him. Anyway, I prefer the old story, and certainly as you listen to this well filled 77-minute album, with 20 of John Field’s Nocturnes included, it’s perfectly obvious that stylistically there is much similarity between the output of the great Pole and the talented Irishman. Poblocka is a John Field specialist, who 20 years ago recorded the Nocturnes on a conventional grand piano, and has now recorded them on a Erard 1838 period piano of a type with which Chopin would certainly have been familiar. Field does not have Chopin’s distinctive melodic gift, but this is still extremely relaxing, undemanding late night music.  Buy from Amazon > Haydn: 107 SymphoniesVarious artistsDecca 4789604This is the first complete cycle of Haydn symphonies on period instruments, and draws on performances by the Academy of Ancient Music under the late Christopher Hogwood, recorded in the 1990s, others, including all the London symphonies by the London based Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment under Frans Bruggen, and three symphonies not otherwise available in much more modern recordings by the Accademia Bizantina under Ottavio Dantone. I don’t think it matters much frankly whether you get your Haydn played by a traditional symphony orchestra, or on original instruments. I certainly wouldn’t want to be without recordings by masters like Thomas Beecham, George Szell, and Colin Davis.  Nor will the complete recordings, also on Decca, by Antal Doráti ever be set aside, in my household at least. But it’s good to have them on original instruments, especially since the Academy of Ancient Music under Christopher Hogwood is lively, spirited, and he has a real grip of the symphonic argument.  All too often with original instruments, the conductors are better musicologists than they are podium giants, but this is not the case here. Interestingly, this includes 107 symphonies; Haydn wrote 104 numbered symphonies, but they have found others.  What a busy fellow he was! Buy from Amazon > Rodrigo/Brouwer: Guitar ConcertosMiguel Trápaga/Real Filharmonía de Galicia/Óliver DíazNaxos 8573542 After a period when it seemed the classical Spanish guitar was out of favour, there has now been a huge bounce back, led by Rodrigo’s Concierto de Aranjuez, a concerto which I first loved 50 years ago. This performance by Miguel Trápaga, with a Spanish orchestra and conductor is certainly authentic, if maybe not as sophisticated as some of the better known international guitarists manage. But it’s interesting because you also get one of more than a dozen concertos written by Leo Brouwer (b.1939), who has been an indefatigable composer of accessible guitar music, including, amongst other things, transcriptions of Beatles numbers, indeed he has even composed a Beatles Concerto for the guitar. So he will be an interesting discovery for those who don’t know him.  There is also a piece by Frank Martin, a notable Swiss composer, whose music will not attract you the way the Rodrigo does, but is still well worth hearing.

The Magnificent SevenJames Horner/Simon FranglenSony 88985346202 James Horner of Titanic fame died in a plane crash last year, a few days after starting work on what would have been, had he lived, surely the greatest challenge of his career; to create a score for the new Magnificent Seven that could rival Elmer Bernstein’s iconic one for the 1960 original. Apparently Horner had a chance to work up a few themes, that have now been loyally turned by his close friend Simon Franglen and Horner’s regular team, into a full score. That’s the good news; the bad news is that sadly it isn’t up to much. There’s no killer tune to rival Elmer Bernstein’s totally memorable one. OK, this is a different sort of take on the story – I get that. So a different sort of memorable tune would have sufficed, and John Williams or Ennio Morricone would surely have found one...or if James Horner himself had been spared, because his Titanic main theme is also extremely fine. There’s a lot of clever orchestrations here, very evocative of the great outdoors. But Ennio Morricone did that so much better 50 years ago in his Spaghetti Westerns'. Come back Clint Eastwood, all is forgiven. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >Dolce VitaJonas Kaufmann/Orchestra del Teatro Massimo di Palermo/Asher FischSony 88875183642 Jonas Kaufmann is always keen to burnish his Italian credentials, to emulate the great tenors of the past, and engage with a wider audience than the fat cats in the best seats in the world's opera houses. And there’s much to enjoy in this generous collection of popular Italian songs, quite a lot of which are not as well known as they should be. Kaufmann fans shouldn’t hesitate, nor anyone who enjoys good tunes well sung. However, it’s idle to pretend he’s as good at this stuff as Pavarotti, and indeed a number of other genuine Italian or Italianate singers. Pavarotti’s singing of the opening song, Caruso, written especially for him, was so enticing, when I heard it being played in the main square of Ravelo, I went into a jewellers shop and affected an interest in coral jewellery, (which wouldn’t suit me don’t you think?!) in order to find out what it was.  I wouldn’t have bothered with this version, decent enough though it is, but it just doesn’t sweep you away like Pavarotti. Similarly, Torna a Surriento, one of my favourite of all Pavarotti’s recordings, is far more thrillingly despatched by the man from Modena, even though Kaufmann uses the same arrangement by Giancarlo Chiramello. It also doesn’t help that the orchestra sounds a bit weedy compared to the opulent playing for Pavarotti. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >Sonnets in MusicBen Johnson/Graham JohnsonChamps Hill Records CHRCD 103 A very different sort of tenor recital comes from Ben Johnson, who Mystic Mellor has long regarded as a young man with a future. And this summer he has shown his versatility, with an excellent turn in Fledermaus at Holland Park Opera, and now this austere but deeply satisfying recital of sonnets set to music by a range of composers from Schubert and Liszt, to the French minor masters Andre Caplet and Henri Sauguet. Ben Johnson won the audience prize at the last Cardiff Singer of the World, and this disc augments the recital he gave then, and its full of good things, for which I feel sure we have also to thank Graham Johnson, who knows the song repertoire better than anyone on the planet. So as well as Liszt’s Petrarch Sonnets, and three of Parry’s English Lyrics, there are also interesting rarities by the dilettante composer William Aikin, Vaughan Williams’ mightily impressive Silent Noon (sonnets by D.G. Rossetti), and a charming contribution from my host at Champs Hill the estimable David Bowerman, which doesn’t seem at all out of place in this distinguished company.   Buy from Amazon > The Soldiers Return: Guitar works inspired by ScotlandJames Akers Resonus Classics RES10165Resonus is a new one on me, but have recently sent me a charming collection of albums exploring interesting highways and byways of solo and chamber repertoire. Of which, for me, the most memorable is The Soldier’s Return, extremely well played by James Akers, an experienced recitalist, and lecturer in plucked instruments at the Royal Scottish Conservatoire. What he has done is collect an hour’s worth of guitar music inspired by Scotland, not a note of which I had ever heard previously. Much of it is by Mauro Giuliani, though as far as I am aware, never visited Scotland, but Scottish melodies (which were after all set by Beethoven) were in regular circulation in early 19th century Europe, and Akers has found half a dozen of them – stuff like The Blue Bells of Scotland and expanded them a bit to make engaging concert items. There’s also a Hungarian guitarist Johann Kaspar Mertz's take on Fingal's Cave. I don’t suppose he went there either, while of course Mendelssohn did, which may account for the fact Mendelssohn’s piece is far more vivid than Mertz’s. The highlight here is Fernando Sor’s Variations on a Favourite Scottish Scene. The scene is Ye Banks and Braes o' Bonnie Doon, which sounds really good on this charming seven minute piece, that I shall certainly be playing within the next few weeks on my Sunday evening programme. Well done Resonus.  I look forward to receiving more enticing albums from you. Buy from Amazon > The Complete RCA & Sony Classical Album CollectionEvgeny KissinSony 88875127202 I so well remember joining in huge standing ovations at the Royal Festival Hall for the teenage Kissin, it remains a sadness that his career progression have never really lived up to that spectacular start, though he remains a busy concert artist, making fairly regular visits to the recording studio. Perhaps it’s because his technical facility that so excited us all back then, has not been matched in succeeding years by more mature interpretative insight,  Certainly, however much Chopin he plays so engagingly, as here in this box, he won’t be another Arthur Rubinstein. But he remains an interesting pianist with the ability to sustain a mixed recital, a Chopin really well, and make a decent enough job of the range pf popular concertos to be found in this collection.

Mendelssohn and Schumann: Piano ConcertosIngrid Fliter/Scottish Chamber Orchestra/Antonio MendezLinn CKD 555 Ever since she thrilled us with her recordings of Chopin’s Piano Concertos, we’ve been eagerly awaiting Ingrid Fliter's take on the equally romantic concertos of Schumann and Mendelssohn. The wait was worth it. She brilliantly tackles Schumann’s shifting colours and technical demands head on, not for a moment compromising the work’s lyricism. And she brings out all of Mendelssohn’s melodic genius while deftly handling all of the work’s demands on the virtuoso. The Scottish Chamber Orchestra provide well-balanced and taut accompaniment and it’s exciting to hear Antonio Méndez recorded for the first time, an exciting young conductor who is destined for greatness. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Yehudi Menuhin was born on 22 April 1916, and in honour of his centenary, three substantial box sets have been issued, two from Warner – who have inherited EMI's almost seven decade relationship with Menuhin – and one from Sony, drawing on the early Victor recordings Menuhin made for them first in his teens, and later when in his mid-twenties. The Menuhin Century Warner Classics 0825646782741 For most music lovers, 80 CDs, 11 DVDs and a 200-page hardback book will be too much Menuhin, and is probably best recommended to specialist collectors only. But of course, the various boxes contained within this massive offering are also available separately. For me, the one to have is the second box, with 18 albums featuring Menuhin in his youthful prime, including his celebrated recording of the Elgar Concerto, made with the composer when Menuhin was 16.  Also of historical as well as musical significance are the albums he made in the early 1950s with Wilhelm Furtwängler of the Beethoven and Mendelssohn Concertos. The thing about Menuhin is that he was not only a distinguished musician, but also a great humanitarian. He took a lot of stick from fellow Jewish musicians for working with Furtwängler, who was tainted by his decision to stay in Nazi Germany during the War. Menuhin thought Furtwängler had no truck with Nazism, and was determined to work with him, and bravely did so. Musically, the results are first class. Later on Menuhin’s technique faltered, but almost everything here bears the mark of a master musician. Sadly though, none of his recordings as a conductor are included. A shame because a lot of them are well worth re-hearing.  Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Yehudi - The Art of MenuhinWarner Classics 2564678257 This three album compilation covers concertos, chamber music, and encore pieces and, with 3½ hours of music for under £10, it's a formidable bargain. However it falls foul of the big problem inherent in compilations: a lot of people, myself included, get fed up with bits and pieces, and want a whole work, not just a movement randomly drawn from a much bigger piece. However, at its modest price it’s a good introduction to Menuhin’s art. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Yehudi Menuhin; The Complete American Victor RecordingsRCA 88875198542 Menuhin made his first recordings for Victor in New York aged only 12, and despite noisy surfaces that could, and should, have been better cleaned up, this makes for exciting listening. Even at that tender age, Menuhin was a mature musician, with great musical understanding, and a formidable technique. RCA Victor re-entered his life in his mid-20s, when his playing was still first class. There is some wonderful music making captured here, notably two versions of the Bruch G minor Concerto, the first - from 1945 - with Monteux, the second with Munch, in 1951. These performances have superb freshness and vigour, and leap out of the grooves in a way that still sounds truly remarkable.  Of all the boxes on offer here, in many ways, this is the one that offers, at a very inexpensive price, the most exciting music making. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Greensleeves: Folk Music of the British IslesThe Armonico Consort/Christopher MonksSignumSIGCD447 This excellent album is disappointing only in its duration – 52 minutes isn’t good enough these days. Otherwise the singing of the 10-member Armonico Consort, founded and directed by Christopher Monks, is exemplary. The only surprising thing is that this recording has been in the can since June 2013. Why? The 15 mainly folk songs here are an enticing combination of the familiar and the unfamiliar; many will know the traditional Welsh melody Suo Gân, but not its companion piece here, Lisa Lân, both presented in excellent arrangements by the veteran Director of Music at Caius College Cambridge, Geoffrey Webber. He also contributes the best arrangement of Greensleeves I can ever recall hearing. Both Greensleeves and Lisa Lân can be heard on my Sunday programme at 7pm, as can Vaughan Williams’ equally successful arrangement of Loch Lomond and, representing Ireland where he was born, Stanford’s The Blue Bird, my favourite of all British part songs. Once heard, never forgotten. And if you don’t know it, do please tune in on Sunday – you’ve a treat in store.Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Violin Sonatas: Elgar, Debussy, RespighiJames Ehnes/Andrew ArmstrongOnyx ONYX4159 This superb new James Ehnes issue, with his regular pianist Andrew Armstrong, illustrates my point about duration. The Elgar and Respighi sonatas last over 50 minutes between them, and that could have been that for this CD. But, so as not to short change hard pressed music lovers, room is also found for Debussy’s poignant Violin Sonata, his last completed work, and even a little Berceuse by Sibelius, bringing this album up to a more than adequate 69 minutes. Ehnes is one of today’s finest violinists, and he and Armstrong understand each other’s qualities, so as to deliver eloquent and idiomatic playing of these sonatas, which, although composed within a relatively short time of each other, are very different. It was good to hear the neglected Respighi Sonata given such distinguished advocacy. But, quickly jamming on my hat as Chairman of the Elgar Foundation, the outstanding piece here, for me, is Elgar’s Sonata, written by the thoroughly depressed composer, in exile in Sussex, during the closing weeks of World War 1. Of course it’s backward looking, and very Brahmsian.  But then Elgar’s and Brahms's lives overlapped for four decades. And of course, with a composer of Elgar’s quality, this sonata may breathe the same air as Brahms’s three, but is in no sense derivative. I sometimes feel chamber music is neglected these days by many music lovers, who do not feel the emotional impact of orchestral music comes across when it’s just one violin and one piano. If you feel that way, sample this album.  I suspect it will change your mind.

The Lyrical Clarinet, Vol. 2Michael Collins/Michael McHaleChandos CHAN10901 Michael Collins is an exceptional clarinettist – both technically and musically – who offers convincing performances of a wide range of music. He also has a questing intelligence, which means he isn’t content just to play a few clarinet favourites but is always looking to push the envelope to cover music that’s easy to miss. Here he and his excellent pianist Michael McHale explore eight composers, who either wrote for the clarinet, or whose music can readily be transcribed, such as the Irish composer, John Field. McHale has transcribed three of them for this album and they make very pleasant listening.  Among other notable transcriptions here is Massenet’s evergreen Meditation. More challenging is some 20th century stuff, particularly Jean Françaix’s Theme and Variations (1974), and Carlos Guastavino’s Sonata (1970) Stir in some French masters – Chausson, Debussy and Ravel – and you have an excellent album that covers off most of what the clarinet can do, and further proves what a beautiful instrument it is when as silkily played as it is here.Buy from Amazon >   Join Aled after 10am each weekday to hear a track from the Album of the Week. Cinema AffairLisa Friend/City of Prague Philharmonic OrchestraSilva Screen SILKD6053 Lisa Friend is a remarkable flautist – and also extremely charming – who deserves to do well.  She comes from an intensely musical family: her father, Rodney Friend, was a notable violinist, and leader of London orchestras for more than 30 years. Lisa’s latest album features a dozen arrangements of film tunes, some of them well known, some of them not. She plays most beautifully throughout, with excellent orchestral accompaniment. This is another of those albums that makes ideal listening either in the car, or at home over a drink, after a long day. It will also appeal to all ages, and anybody who is remotely musical, whatever their musical taste, will get something positive out of listening to it. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >     Dvořák: Violin Concerto in A minor/Romance in F/Mazurek/Four Romantic PiecesJan Mráček/Lukáš Klánský/Czech National Symphony Orchestra/James JuddOnyx ONYX4160 This is an extremely useful, well played album, recorded in Prague last November, with the young Czech violinist Jan Mráček. The Czech sleeve note writer advises that Dvořák thought more highly of his Violin Concerto than his much more celebrated Cello Concerto. I hadn’t heard that before, but wouldn’t be especially surprised. The Violin Concerto is a fine piece; anyone who likes the Bruch Concerto, or indeed the Brahms, will enjoy this.  But for reasons I have never fully understood, it hasn’t enjoyed the fame of either of the above, or its cello companion. This concerto is full of good tunes, and the slow movement is especially effective.  If you want to know what that sounds like, I shall be playing it towards the end of my programme this Sunday after 8.30pm. The usefulness of this album, and why it’s my Album of the Week, is that it embraces pretty much all the music Dvořák wrote for solo violin, including a notable Romance in F, and Four Romantic Pieces for violin and piano. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Tchaikovsky: Symphonies 1, 2 & 5Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra/Vasily PetrenkoOnyx ONYX4150 These recordings date from 2014, and are issued by the RLPO themselves on Onyx, an artist-led label, full of good things, as the Dvořák recommendation above confirms. The RLPO, Classic FM’s Orchestra in the North West, have flourished under Petrenko’s charismatic leadership. He too has benefited from his close association with an orchestra willing to learn, in a city where real and widespread enthusiasm for him has surely have given his confidence a real boost. It’s a shame though room wasn’t found for other stuff.  This two album set is only 118 minutes long, when it could have been 160 minutes.  Nevertheless no one who buys or downloads these recordings will be disappointed. No. 5 is a masterpiece from Tchaikovsky in full maturity. I shall be playing the slow movement – for me the finest symphonic movement Tchaikovsky ever wrote – in my programme on Sunday after 7pm. The first two symphonies are much more apprentice works, but very charming in their way, especially when as well presented as here.Buy from Amazon >Ennio Morricone: JubileeEnnio MorriconeMilan 3299039978122 This is a re-issue of a 2002 recording, featuring 23 extracts drawn from the soundtracks of the almost 500 movies that Morricone has written the music for. Although Milan Records is a new one on me, this disc is distributed by Universal in some parts of Europe, and Warners in others, so isn’t hard to come by. What more can I say about Morricone, except, he is a simply extraordinary musician? As well as all his film work, he has found time to compose almost 100 concert pieces. I saw him at the O2 a few months back, and even in his late 80s, he is a most persuasive conductor of his own stuff, showing remarkable vigour, standing throughout a more than two hour concert. This album features the best of Morricone, which doesn’t always mean the best known. On Sunday I will be playing Deborah’s Theme from perhaps my favourite of all film scores, Once Upon A Time In America, which should have won an Oscar, except the producers failed to enter it.  I’m also playing the Romance from the film The Legend of 1900, almost equally good, but hardly known. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Mendelssohn: Songs Without WordsRonald BrautigamBIS1983 Regular readers of this page, and regular listeners to my programmes, will know I am extremely keen on the Swedish pianist Ronald Brautigam. He plays on period pianos, and has, amongst other things, recorded an excellent complete Beethoven Piano Sonata series for BIS, on an instrument of Beethoven’s time. In this good value album, he does the same for Mendelssohn, playing 29 Songs Without Words, and other bits and pieces on a reproduction 1830 Erard piano. I suspect the end result closely reproduces the sort of sound Mendelssohn himself would have made. Does it sound better than a modern grand piano? No, it’s very different, but the authenticity, when as persuasively played as Brautigam does, makes this more than just a dusty archaeological exercise. The title Songs Without Words is just a generic description of romantic salon piano music, designed to be played at home, and full of romantic gestures, which Mendelssohn pioneered, but that soon became a fashionable mode of expression for later 19th century romantic composers. Some of these pieces are more distinctive than others.  Some have great tunes, others don’t. But all are most enjoyable. A bit off the beaten track with this one, but well worth exploring.

The critically acclaimed pianist Elizabeth Joy Roe gives us the fascinating chance to hear the birth of a musical form which was created by Field but perfected by Chopin, whose works overshadowed Field's from then on.

FR720 This is the fifth in the much praised Pittsburgh Live! series of high quality recordings. Their recordings of Dvořák and Janáček, and Bruckner’s 4th symphony have each received Grammy nominations for Best Orchestral Performance. This time, Manfred Honeck and the Pittsburgh Symphony orchestra turn their attention to the symphony that Tchaikovsky considered his best. The conductor has clearly made a deep study of the work and uncovers all the workings of the composer’s soul, requiring extraordinary technical perfection to reach such a level of expression. The album also includes the world premiere of the Rusalka Fantasy, an orchestral suite drawn from Dvořák’s opera by Honeck and Tomáš Ille.

Bach: Violin Concertos Cecilia Bernardini/Alfredo Bernardini/Huw Daniel/Dunedin Consort/John ButtLinn CKD519 The Dunedin Consort already has a great reception for its Bach performances and this highly anticipated new recording is certain to please fans, and create new ones. Dutch-Italian violinist Cecilia Bernardini takes a break from her duties as leader of the ensemble to deliver stellar performances that draw out all the lyricism, wit and exuberance of Bach’s writing. Bach’s concerto for violin and oboe is joyful and colourful, with a supremely lyrical central movement. Two of Bach's solo violin concertos, overflow with intricate and pin sharp detail and the famous, sublime slow movement of Bach’s Double Concerto has never been more heartrending. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  After 6pm each weekday evening, John Brunning showcases a track from his Drive Discovery, a fantastic new release.

Daring virtuosity and perfectly pitched sweetness throughout.Buy from Amazon > Dvorak, Schumann: Piano ConcertosStephen Hough/City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra/Andris NelsonsHyperion CDA68099   Surprisingly, these recordings have been hanging around in the archives a while, the Schumann having been made as long ago as November 2014. But, like all of Stephen’s recordings, they are excellent. The Schumann, predictably so. The Dvorak is a less obvious success, given that it’s a bit sub-Beethoven, and has never had anything like the success of the Cello Concerto, or indeed, for that matter, of the also somewhat overlooked, Violin Concerto. Stephen, and his conductor, Andris Nelsons, will not persuade you it is a great masterpiece, but they will keep you entertained. Not only is this CD a further tribute to Stephen Hough’s skills as one of the world’s finest pianists, but also to the standards achieved by the CBSO under Nelsons, who has now, of course, departed to Boston. Even if you have a recording of the Schumann Concerto, don’t overlook this one.  And if you don’t know Dvorak, you have a treat in store.Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Neeme Järvi conducts IbertOrchestre de la Suisse Romande/Neeme JärviChandos CHSA5168  Jacques Ibert was a popular figure in London, where he was known affectionately to orchestral musicians as Jacky Bear. His music is all of a piece with the man – for the most part rollicking good fun.  He had a genuine melodic gift, akin, if not quite so distinguished, as that of his near contemporary Francis Poulenc. And, like Poulenc, a particular skill for perky, brittle French orchestration. It was only when he tried to be more serious, he came unstuck. There are a few examples of that here in this outstanding Neeme Jarvi album, recorded with his Geneva band, the Suisse Romande Orchestra, which lasts 82 minutes.  It’s another Chandos success, and a standing rebuke to those companies who still put out 50-odd minute CDs. I prefer to accentuate the positive, and rather than focus on the manifest limitations of stuff like the Bacchanale (1956), and the Ouverture de Fête (1940), I would rather say how marvellous it is to hear such a well turned recording of Ibert’s Mediterranean travelogue Escales (1922), especially the Arabic middle bit, encompassing a journey from Tunis to Nefta. Best of all, and alone worth the price of this CD, is the Divertissement (1930).  It’s literally a musical riot of good fun, where Ibert draws on the incidental music he wrote for the celebrated French farce, The Italian Straw Hat.Buy from Amazon >  Bela Bartok: Complete WorksDecca 4789311 This bargain priced, 32-album, complete Bartok collection, is entirely self-recommending. Decca, and associated companies in the Universal group, have had some of the finest Bartok interpreters on their books, and they all get a look-in here. Conductors such as Pierre Boulez, and the Hungarian born Georg Solti, Antal Dorati, and Ferenc Fricsay, as well as the pre-eminent Hungarian maestro of today, Ivan Fischer. As for pianists, it’s a dazzling list, including Geza Anda, surely the best of the lot, but whose recordings of the Piano Concertos with Fricsay, are sadly not preferred to Zoltan Kocsis’s efforts with Fischer, fine though these undoubtedly are. Stir in cameo appearances by pianists of the stature of Sviatoslav Richter and Martha Argerich, and you’ve got something really special. Particularly when the Takacs Quartet are unbeatable in the string quartets, and some other chamber music besides. It was also clever to dig out the sadly short lived Istvan Kertesz’s version of Bluebeard’s Castle, with Walter Berry and Christa Ludwig, a real connoisseurs choice from the 60s. This box is unmissable, and unbeatable. Bartok fans will never need to buy anything else. Buy from Amazon >Stravinsky: Petrushka/The Rite of SpringOrchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire de Paris/Pierre MonteuxDecca Eloquence ELQ4808903Buy from Amazon >Download from iTunes > Tchaikovsky: Swan Lake – HighlightsLondon Symphony Orchestra/Pierre MonteuxDecca Eloquence ELQ4808907Buy from Amazon >Download from iTunes >Pierre Monteux was another great French character, who took on the conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra in 1961, when he was 86, and asked for a 25 year contract with an option for 25 more. This Swan Lake has been a favourite of mine for more than half a century, and it still sounds well, with pacing by Monteux that reflects his work as Music Director of Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes between 1911-1914. The LSO play well for him, and while there are more modern, hi-fi spectaculars than this, it’s still a warmly satisfying opportunity to hear one of the great musicians of the twentieth century. For Monteux, Swan Lake was contemporary music, having been commissioned in the year of his birth.  He also thought better of it than Stravinsky, who once said of Swan Lake: “There is a lot to be said for bad taste”. But the really unmissable album here is the Stravinsky one. Monteux gave the premieres of both Petrushka and The Rite of Spring, so these recordings are documents of real historical significance. And for reasons beyond just the participation of Monteux, more than 40 years on. Because, the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra in 1956, when these recordings were made, would have sounded exactly like the orchestra Monteux conducted at these premieres, with very Gallic woodwind and brass, and fairly thin strings. Furthermore, it is highly likely that some of the musicians here played at these premieres, or at the very least worked alongside, or trained under, those who did.  So what was then a living tradition was being passed down, so we can hear it in perfectly decent sound today. Of course, there are better recorded accounts of these extraordinary works, but few that enjoy the same authority.

The album also includes Johann Christian Bach’s poetic and rarely performed Viola Concerto, giving Radulović the opportunity to make his recording debut as a viola player.

Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >     Prokofiev: Romeo and JulietOslo Philharmonic/Vasily PetrenkoLAWO Classics LWC1105 When Vasily Petrenko took on the Oslo Philharmonic, I was surprised for two reasons. Firstly, wasn't it a bit too much the same as his Royal Liverpool Philharmonic – a good Northern European orchestra? And, would he find it difficult to reproduce the form that had allowed Mariss Jansons 30 years ago to turn the Oslo Philharmonic into one of Europe's most highly regarded bands. What was in it for Petrenko? Anyway, he is there, and on the evidence of this own label, complete Romeo and Juliet, recorded last November, doing well. He has a light touch with both the orchestra and the piece, and makes it sound really balletic throughout, without confining himself to tempi that dancers would find comfortable, and which makes ballet performances such drudgery for good conductors. It's interesting to compare his efforts with the two Suites recorded in Oslo by Mariss Jansons in January 1988 for EMI, with, fascinatingly, the same producer, John Fraser.  Well done him, to have stayed the course for so long. It shows, that the orchestra is not that much different in quality now, than it was then. Despite Jansons being a top class orchestral trainer, much remains the same. Jansons is more obviously symphonic in his approach, but there are moments when I rather prefer Petrenko's more theatrical feel. Whilst this one will not displace either the Previn/LSO or Maazel/Cleveland versions, it is well worth considering. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > English Music for StringsLSO String Ensemble/Roman SimovićLSO Live LSO 0792 Roman Simović has led the LSO for half a dozen years now, and clearly has the orchestra's string section under good control. Here he took a section of the LSO strings – around 30 players – into the Barbican for a concert last spring, and played three English string masterpieces – Elgar’s Introduction and Allegro, Vaughan Williams's Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis, and Britten's Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge. We British don't always credit ourselves, as we should, for having produced such a stunning array of string orchestra masterpieces. The three offered here all sound wonderful both separately, and listened to complete as a concert. It's hard to fault Simović's direction, or his colleagues playing, and my only grouse here is the short weight – 54 Minutes isn't long enough, particularly when there are other splendid pieces, such as Elgar's Serenade that could have completed an otherwise fine album.

Bach: Flute ConcertosEmmanuel Pahud/Kammerakademie Potsdam/Trevor PinnockWarner Classics 2564627679 If a time machine took us back to 1780s Vienna, and we bumped into Haydn and Mozart talking about ""the great Bach"", it would be C.P.E. not J.S. that they'd be discussing. Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach was a celebrated member of Frederick the Great’s Sanssouci ensemble, and later music director in Hamburg. His late father at that time, enjoyed little more than a regional reputation. So, did we get J.S. Bach wrong, or, in different ways, both of them? I think the latter. J.S. Bach is plainly one of the real greats. C.P.E. Bach is a most talented 18th century composer, but on this evidence, nothing like as distinctive as his father, or indeed others such as Vivaldi and Handel, both of whom wrote concertos far more memorable than these three. However well Pahud plays, there's something too hard driven about these performances, which is maybe the conductor’s fault. But what is really lacking is melodic distinction. These concertos slip out of your mind the moment you have stopped playing them. That, for me, isn’t a mark of greatness. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Handel: MessiahErin Wall/Elizabeth DeShong/Andrew Staples/John Relyea/Toronto Mendelssohn Choir/Toronto Symphony Orchestra/Sir Andrew DavisChandos CHSA5176 This is a curiosity; interesting, but in the last analysis, hard to recommend. What Andrew Davis has done here is to totally re-orchestrate Messiah, starting from the Victorian musicologist Ebenezer Prout's edition, and bringing the orchestration up to date with some interesting and curious instrumental ideas. I'm not against such re-orchestrations. After all, Mozart did one. Nor am I totally fixated on the kind of vegetarian, original instrument performances, that tend to prevail these days. They to my mind, lack grandeur, overdecorate the solo parts, and usually take all the choruses at an irritating jog-trot. However, Davis goes too far in the other direction, and is not helped by some of his soloists. ""I Know That My Redeemer Liveth"" has to have spiritual radiance, something American soprano Erin Wall in this live Toronto performance plainly doesn’t do. Her intrusive wobble is also aggravating. Nor does she make much of a go of the great duet ""He Shall Feed His Flock"" neither does the mezzo Elizabeth DeShong. Frankly, Davis, who, on his own admission, plainly spent ages doing this re-orchestration, would have been better advised to try to persuade Chandos to record it with one of their British orchestras, in the studio, with a more sensitive pair of female soloists. In that way, difficult balance issues, and a better sense of religious conviction, might have emerged. Another one to be approached with caution.Download from iTunes > Buy from Amazon > David Mellor is Opera and Classical Critic of the Mail on Sunday and presenter of his own show on Classic FM, Sundays 7pm.

Franz Xaver Mozart/Muzio Clementi: Piano ConcertosHoward Shelley/Sinfonieorchester St GallenHyperion CDA68126  Franz Xaver Mozart (1791-1844) was born just four months before Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s death, so he didn’t know his celebrated father. His mother Constanze pushed him really hard to have a career as a travelling virtuoso, trading under the name W.A.Mozart Jnr. Naturally, Franz Xaver did not find the burden of being Mozart’s son easy, but he had a decent enough career and these two piano concertos bring his own, long neglected talents into the spotlight. The first was composed in 1809, when he was only 18, and is scored for a full classical orchestra minus clarinets. The second dates from 1818 and is more complex. This is the third of a series called The Classical Piano Concerto with long-standing Hyperion Artist Howard Shelley rattling off the concertos with panache while directing the St Gallen Symphony Orchestra from Switzerland.

Standout here is the emotional Light of the Seven, an almost 10-minute long piano and string lullaby that swells into a chilling cry for organ and choir.

Not just one for the fans.Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >        George Butterworth: Orchestral WorksBBC National Orchestra of Wales/Kriss RussmanBIS 2195 George Butterworth died on the Somme on 5 August 1916, aged only 31. It's terrific that this tribute album, beautifully presented in every respect (including a hauntingly memorable cover), should come from the Scandinavian company BIS, rather than a British one. It lasts a generous 75 minutes, and what you get is some music most of us will know, but a lot we won’t – because three of these pieces are receiving their world premiere recordings. It’s all the inspiration of the conductor and composer Kriss Russman. He leads persuasive performances of the three Butterworth masterpieces that are at the heart of his claims on the attention of posterity: The Banks of Green Willow, A Shropshire Lad - Rhapsody, and the Two English Idylls. Russman then adds, with the assistance of the baritone James Rutherford, the only song cycle Butterworth composed with orchestral accompaniment Love Blows as the Wind Blows, which is not at all familiar. It's decent enough music, though not really memorable. Butterworth and Rutherford have more fertile ground to till in the six A Shropshire Lad songs, newly orchestrated by Russman, who does a really fine job. Russman also orchestrates a so-called Suite for String Quartette that most people will never have encountered before, myself included. Again, it isn’t memorable but good, easy listening. What is memorable is Russman’s completion of the Orchestral Fantasia, a piece Butterworth began in the summer of 1914 and left unfinished when he went to war. There is a 92-bar, fully scored manuscript in the composers own hand lasting 3½ minutes in the Bodleian Library. Russman has studied this and completed the piece along Butterworth's lines, so it now lasts 8½ minutes. It’s a delight and I shall be finding an early opportunity to play it on my Sunday show. Russman also contributes some excellent notes about all the pieces recorded here. The author of Butterworth’s biography Anthony Murphy, meanwhile, contributes an interesting biographical note. So this truly is an exceptional issue, and not to be missed by any devotee of British music.   Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >     Complete Recordings on Deutsche GrammophonEmerson String QuartetDG4 795982   The Emerson Quartet celebrate 40 years in the business with this marvellous 52 album box, available at the ridiculously inexpensive price of £84 or less, bringing together all their DG recordings made between 1987-2010. Here they offer most of the pinnacles of the string quartet repertoire, including complete Beethoven, Brahms, and Shostakovich cycles. Only a shortage of Mozart and Haydn quartets blunts a bit of enthusiasm. But they more than compensate for only six Mozart string quartets by including a complete set of flute quartets, the clarinet quintet, and indeed a lot of other enticing quintets, including the late Schubert string quintet, and the Brahms clarinet quintet. The sound is excellent throughout, the artistry of the highest level. Please don’t miss this set; take it away on holiday for a great summer listen.Buy from Amazon >  Michael Haydn: SymphoniesCzech Chamber Philharmonic Orchestra Pardubice/Patrick GalloisVolume 1: Naxos 8573497Volume 2: Naxos 8573498The French flautist and conductor Patrick Gallois has produced some excellent recordings for Naxos, and now embarks on a Michael Haydn Symphony series from the Czech Republic. Fitting comfortably into the “not many people know that” category, is the fact that Josef Haydn had 11 siblings, only two of which were professional musicians.  The more talented of the two was Michael, who enjoyed a good career in church music, and elsewhere. He is not the equal of his brother, but he isn’t negligible either. Gallois and his Czech band play four symphonies on each of these two volumes, available separately, the first of which lasts 71 minutes, and the second of which 69. There’s good value here, and some interesting listening for the curious.   Volume 1:Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >Volume 2:Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Ravel: Dances and Fairy TalesJoint Venture Percussion DuoBIS 9054 Bizet: CarmenKsenija Sidorova/Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra/Sascha GoetzelDG 4795224You know I’m always up for ""out of left field"" experiences, and would never for the sake of it reject arrangements of masterpieces composed for other forces. But neither of these will do, I’m afraid. The Joint Venture Percussion Duo are both marimba players, with one of them doubling up on the vibraphone. They play three of Ravel’s greatest masterpieces here, Le Tombeau de Couperin, Mother Goose, and the Pavane. In an album that lasts an unacceptable 44 minutes, they manage to prove that this combination of two marimbas, even in Mother Goose, where some of the oriental inflections in the piece are attractively put across by this duo, simply doesn’t work.  There is too much missing, compared with the originals.   Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Also disappointing, sadly, are the first fruits of Ksenija Sidorova’s new recording contract with DG. I’m an admirer of Sidorova, a strikingly charismatic musician on and off the platform. She is London based, and I have listened to her, and spoken with her on a number of occasions, and I really do want her to do well. But whatever possessed her to embark on these arrangements of Carmen I shall never know. She’s backed up by a small orchestra, and other soloists, but the piano accordion simply doesn’t shine here. As Astor Piazzolla constantly proved, by playing and composing for, the piano accordion’s cousin, the bandoneon, it can be a strikingly attractive instrument in the right music. But this isn’t the right music.  She would surely have made more of an impact, had she recorded some of the shorter display pieces at which she excels. I hope the sales of this CD will not be so disappointing that they nip a promising recording career in the bud. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >   David Mellor is Opera and Classical Critic of the Mail on Sunday and presenter of his own show on Classic FM, Sundays 7pm.   ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202199.51/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320024206-20190320050206-00414.warc.gz

Hora CeroThe 12 Cellists of the Berlin PhilharmonicSony 88875143462The world-famous cello ensemble return with a new album after six years, named ‘Zero Hour’ after one of the tracks, Astor Piazzolla's Buenos Aires Hora Cero. This is a pretty unique offering: no other orchestra has such an independent ensemble of cellos, and they’re the only ensemble formed from the Berlin Phil that is actually officially allowed to use the orchestra’s name. Along with the Piazzolla, the album features a selection of tangos that were specifically arranged for the ensemble, mostly by members of the 12 Cellists themselves. It’s a wonderfully dark and rich sound, giving these often brooding dances the weight of a symphonic sound. The video below from 2014 gives a taste of what to expect.

For fans of the piano music of Erik Satie, Philip Glass, Einaudi and even Keith Jarrett, Greenaway's music is a welcome new discovery.

He also has a questing intelligence, which means he isn’t content just to play a few clarinet favourites but is always looking to push the envelope to cover music that’s easy to miss. Here he and his excellent pianist Michael McHale explore eight composers, who either wrote for the clarinet, or whose music can readily be transcribed. Such as the Irish composer, John Field, whose Nocturnes I recommended last week. McHale has transcribed three of them for this album and they make very pleasant listening.  Among other notable transcriptions here is Massenet’s evergreen Meditation. More challenging is some 20th century stuff, particularly Jean Françaix’s Theme and Variations (1974), and Carlos Guastavino’s Sonata (1970) Stir in some French masters – Chausson, Debussy and Ravel – and you have an excellent album that covers off most of what the clarinet can do, and further proves what a beautiful instrument it is when as silkily played as it is here.Buy from Amazon >  Decca Sound: 55 Great Vocal RecitalsDecca 4789679And still these magnificent bargain boxes keep coming – mainly from Decca, drawing on real gems, some hidden, some not, from its illustrious back catalogue. Decca has always specialised in great vocal and operatic recordings, and since the LP era just after the War, have secured the services of some of the most extraordinary singers of our time. Pavarotti and Sutherland, for example, were both Decca artists for their entire careers. These 55 albums are each devoted to a different singer. It's outstanding value because what you get is an original LP/CD, which then has add-ons to ensure that the LPs, that would originally have run to around 40-50 minutes, are put up to proper CD length i.e. around 70 minutes. You can do the maths yourself, but it amounts to, on my calculations, at least 60 hours of music here. We start off with Volume 1 – the distinguished French soprano, Suzanne Danco in recordings made between 1950 and 1956. Volume 55 is a Joseph Calleja recital recorded as recently as August 2010. As well as giants of the past, there's a good selection of modern stars including Jonas Kaufmann, Juan Diego Florez, and Renée Fleming. This is a gift that will keep on giving. Vocal music of the highest quality embracing, for instance, complete song cycles by Schubert, and operatic excerpts spanning several centuries. Completely unmissable. Buy from Amazon > 125 Years of the Royal Scottish National OrchestraRoyal Scottish National Orchestra/Neeme Järvi/Sir Alexander Gibson/Bryden Thomson/Matthias Bamert/Stéphane Denève/Peter OundjianChandos CHAN241-55 Classic FM's Orchestra in Scotland celebrates its 125th anniversary this year. Over four decades, the RSNO has made some excellent recordings for Chandos under a series of distinguished Music Directors, including Sir Alexander Gibson, Neeme Järvi, and, coming more up to date, Stéphane Denève, and the present incumbent, Peter Oundjian. Chandos joins the celebrations with a double album of highlights from their catalogue that runs to more than 160 minutes. There is a downside, as there always is with these compilations; you get bits and pieces, and sometimes it’s a shame that you don’t get the rest. For instance, Debussy’s Sirènes from the Nocturnes, makes you long to hear the rest, as does the wonderfully tuneful and exuberant Troika from Prokofiev’s Lieutenant Kijé. However there are other things that stand alone, and make for terrific listening, like Mendelssohn’s Hebrides Overture, MacCunn’s boisterous The Land of the Mountain and the Flood, and Enescu’s gloriously buoyant Romanian Rhapsody. A lucky dip then, with almost everything you pick out, a winner. Excellent value indeed.

Very few of his invariably excellent pieces stand out from the crowd the way Beethoven’s Ninth or Mozart’s Don Giovanni do. By happy chance two new recordings of Haydn concertos that further enhance his reputation, have just become available from Onyx. Pavel Gomziakov is a first class soloist in both of the cello concertos. He draws some lovely sounds from his 'King of Portugal' Strad, and also makes a good fist of directing the Lisbon-based Gulbenkian Orchestra. Shai Wosner couples one of Haydn’s finest keyboard concertos, No.11, with the lesser known No.4. He also finds room for two of Haydn’s Cappriccios for solo piano, and stirs in some paprika with a piano concerto and some solo keyboard music from Gyorgy Ligeti. Don't be put off by Ligeti; he's a very entertaining composer most of the time. Besides, there are more than 50 minutes of Haydn here, which is often all you get on a CD, so the Ligeti is best regarded as a bonus you can listen to or not as you choose.

It is a piece for four horns and big orchestra, featuring Horner’s signature lush orchestrations and wide ranging melodic lines. It's combined here with two further world premiere recordings, Kitty Hawk and Conquest of the Air, recording by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic with David Arnold conducting. This album is combined with new recordings of some of Horner's best-loved film music, including Aliens, Legend of the Fall and Iris. The recording also features Norwegian siblings Mari and Hakon Samuelsen, who had worked with Horner over years on his double concerto Pas de Deux, as well as two further world premiere recordings. Unlike many film composers who seem to move deliberately towards atonality in their concert hall works, all of Horner's familiar trademark melody and atmospheric orchestration is here.

Beethoven/Czerny/Liszt: Master and PupilMelvyn TanOnyx ONYX4156 Pianist Melvyn Tan has a strong association with the music of Beethoven having made pioneering recordings for EMI of the five Piano Concertos and the Choral Fantasia with Sir Roger Norrington and the London Classical Players. He also made several discs of the sonatas, and one very special recording on the then newly restored Broadwood piano that was Beethoven’s own instrument. On this album Tan plays on a modern Steinway. The theme of the CD is Master & Pupil. Focusing on three of the great pianist composers of the 19th century who represent the beginning of a long line of masters and pupils, the journey starts with Beethoven who taught the young Carl Czerny, and the young Liszt that Czerny took under his wing in 1819. Tan gives superb interpretations of the music of all three masters of the piano. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Lalo: Symphonie Espagnole/Manén: Violin Concerto No.1Tianwa Yang/Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra/Darrell AngNaxos 8.573067 Naxos produce so many wonderful recordings - around 12 a month hit my desk – that I don’t like to ghettoise them in the bargain category.  So this is my Critic's Choice this week. Tianwa Yang has made some excellent recordings for Naxos, which have won awards across Europe, notably an album of two Mendelssohn violin concertos. She also received great acclaim for  eight albums of the violin music for orchestra, and also for piano, of Sarasate. And the influence of Sarasate is everywhere apparent in these two concertos, because he commissioned Lalo’s Symphonie Espagnole, and one of his star pupils was the teacher of the composer, violinist and pianist Joan Manén. The Lalo is an outstanding work, with a credible Spanish atmosphere, considering the composer was born in Lille! It's in five contrasted movements, and Tianwa Yang is the master of them alll; her playing cannot be faulted in any respect. She is enthusiastically (and idiomatically) accompanied by the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra under Darrell Ang. Joan Manén is a new one on me, it’s another sign of Naxos’s quality that they have commissioned such a long and fascinating sleeve note from Tully Potter, who cheerfully said to me the other day he was perhaps the only person on earth who knew much about Manén!  And he’s probably right. Anyway, Manén was a prodigy violinist and pianist, who, at 10, conducted his first public orchestral concert.  And he wrote this cheerful concerto when only 14, though he did revise it in full maturity. It’s well laid out for the solo instrument, and the orchestra sounds brilliantly Spanish. It lacks the kind of killer tunes you find in the Lalo, but it’s still a very interesting discovery. Tully, in his note, describes the sad fall from grace of Manén, who was as famous as his contemporary Pablo Casals for the first for decades of his life, but then lived the next 40 years in near total obscurity, so when he died in 1971, virtually nobody attended his funeral.  How sad.Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > The Golden Age of Lute MusicJulian BreamAlto ALC1338 Sullivan/Mackerras: Pineapple Poll/OverturesRoyal Philharmonic Orhestra/Charles Mackerras/Pro Arte Orchestra/Malcolm SargentAlto ALC1320 Collectors who love recordings of yesterday, really should take an interest in the Alto catalogue. Julian Bream's Golden Age of Lute Music album runs for 77 minutes, and is an amalgam of two LPs from the early 1960s, when Bream was approaching his peak. One is devoted to Dowland himself, whilst the other covers a range of late 16th century contemporary music by British masters such as Thomas Morley and Robert Johnson. Perhaps the sound is a bit plummy by today’s standards, but the music making has exceptional verve, and this is a delightful listen all through. And if you fancy spending an evening with Mrs White’s Nothinge, or My Ladye Hunsdon’s Puffe, this is definitely one for you. The Sullivan album is, if anything, even more alluring, and it’s a pleasure to recommend it to G&S fans. This again is an amalgamation of two albums, one an arrangement of tunes by G&S by Sir Charles Mackerras which form a ballet called Pineapple Poll that was extremely popular 50 years ago, and that is now linked up to five Sullivan overtures recorded for HMV by Sargent with the so called Pro Arte Orchestra. The best listen here however is the Mackerras ballet, put together by Sir Charles in 1951, and re-recorded by him with what was still, demonstrably, Sir Thomas Beecham’s crack Royal Philharmonic, and the playing and the sound is excellent.  At 78 minutes for a super bargain, this is again unmissable. Berlioz: Romeo et Juliette Michele Losier/Samuel Boden/David Soar/BBC Symphony Chorus/BBC Symphony Orchestra/Sir Andrew DavisChandos CHSA5169 Since the sad death of Richard Hickox, Chandos has turned with increasing frequency to Sir Andrew Davis to do these big choral projects. He generally makes an excellent fist of them, and this is no exception. Berlioz’s Romeo and Juliet is a so-called dramatic symphony, with music for soloists and chorus, as well as some beautiful passages for orchestra, some of which, like the Queen Mab Scherzo have had an alternative life as concert pieces. For me, the 15 minutes Love Scene is one of the most magical things even Berlioz ever composed, and is alone worth the price of this set. We don’t hear this Romeo and Juliet live much, but there are some excellent recordings, now joined by this one. My only regret it that perhaps the fill-ups – the Trojan March, and the magnificent Royal Hunt and Storm also from Les Troyens are a bit short weight. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Chopin: MazurkasPavel KolesnikovHyperion CDA68137 Pavel Kolesnikov was born in Siberia, and trained in Moscow, before transferring to the Royal College of Music, and is now, luckily for us, a long term London resident. Some time back he produced a marvellous album of Tchaikovsky’s The Seasons, which showed how natural, warmly unaffected, and unassuming his playing is. He’s ideally suited to the Mazurkas, where poetic expression matters so much more than the kind of barnstorming required in some of Chopin’s bigger pieces like the Polonaises, and the Ballades. Chopin wrote Mazurkas throughout his career, and they are elusive works, mainly short and undramatic, and therefore not so attractive to a lot of recitalists. Kolesnikov obviously regards their restraint as an asset, and here gives exquisite performances of 24 of them. This young man will be a major force in the future.  And this is an album no Chopin lover should be without.

Mozart with FriendsNils Mönkemeyer/Julia Fischer/Sabine Meyer/William Youn For this exhilarating recording, four of classical music's top stars have teamed up to replicate Mozart's practice of composing pieces for friends and fellow musicians to play with him. The ""Kegelstatt-Trio"" is the perfect example since Mozart wrote it while playing skittles with his chums. He later performed the trio, playing the viola. Besides that, viola player Nils Mönkemeyer chose to explore Mozart's musical development, starting with pieces from The London Sketchbook, which the composer wrote when he was 8 or 9 years old, or the Sonata in F major written by the 11-year-old Mozart. The pleasure these great musicians derive from playing together is audible, and the insights into Mozart in lighter moments is a revelation.Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Berlin RSO/Gerard Schwarz Naxos  A quiz question, asking which slow movement of a symphony was written by a teenager on a boat anchored off Gravesend, would be unlikely to attract many correct answers.  That’s because Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov was a naval officer before he became a hugely respected teacher at the St Petersburg Conservatoire, and arguably the leading and most influential composer in late 19th-century Russia.  RK was a 17-year-old when he composed his First Symphony, and not much older when he composed his Symphony No. 3, which make an attractive pairing on this new Naxos release. Gerard Schwarz and his fine German orchestra make a compelling case for these symphonies, which ought to be better known, even though they are unlikely ever to command the concert hall in live performances. Giving us the chance to listen to this sort of stuff at home, or in the car, is exactly what CDs are for. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Mark KosowerUlster Orchestra/JoAnn Falletta Naxos  Sadly I cannot be quite as positive about another new Naxos issue featuring the two cello concertos of Victor Herbert, even though they are a decent enough listen, and Herbert a fascinating, now almost forgotten, composer.   Victor Herbert (1859-1924) was born in Ireland, and much of his massive career in America from the end of the 19th century onward owes a great deal to his clever marketing as an Irishman, in a city where there were hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrants. But Herbert wasn’t very Irish. He was born in Ireland, but left aged three to come to London. His mother then remarried a German, and he lived in Germany for almost two decades until he emigrated to find fame and fortune in New York.   Which he did, first as a cellist, and then as a composer of popular operettas and other music like these two cello concertos. At the end of his life, he became a highly regarded conductor of his own orchestra.  Indeed, Herbert’s Cello Concerto No.2 is more famous for what it provoked in a greater musician, Antonín Dvorak, than any success it itself achieved.  Dvorak attended the premiere of the piece in 1894 in New York, and it is believed it was this music that induced him to write his own noble cello concerto, which today alongside the Elgar, are the works of choice for international cellists. Sadly neither of these are, and the reasons are obvious from this CD. The music is pleasant enough, but not distinctive, or distinguished. The German cellist Mark Kosower, a new name on me, does his best, and the Ulster Orchestra sound well, but this one is for cello aficionados only. Buy from Amazon >  I complete this week’s review with three Sony bargain boxes, all of fascinating, and sometimes great music, extremely well performed and recorded, and available at the cheapest possible price. The downside of all of them though, is that there are no liner notes whatsoever, only a listing on the back of each CD cover as to what music is to be found there. Sony can and should do better than this. This sort of music requires some explanation. London Symphony Orchestra. (6CDs)  Previn took over the LSO in the late 60s, and soon plunged into English music, and made some outstanding recordings in the 70s, which still sound well.This 6CD Ralph Vaughan Williams set, allows inexpensive access to a symphony cycle of real stature, but echoes the observations made about Sibelius, that VW approached the symphonic challenge in a different way in each of his nine.  The London Symphony (No.2) is the place to start, followed by his choral Sea Symphony (No.1). All of them are worth hearing, especially the so called Pastoral Symphony (No.3) which is not a rural idyll, but Vaughan Williams’s reflections on the battlefields of Flanders where he served as an ambulance man in WW1, though well on in his 40s at the time, and Symphony No.6, which, although VW denied it, is probably his response to the turbulent post war world of weapons of mass destruction. Buy from Amazon >  Various artists (11CDs)  Sir Malcom Arnold endured chronic illness, alcoholism, and neglect to produce some wonderful, tuneful music, and this box can be recommended with confidence to any lover of English music, or lover of great melodies. Arnold’s symphonies, which form the centrepiece of this collection, are not as distinguished as Vaughan Williams’ but still have their moments, especially No2, with its big slow movement tune, dedicated to Friends who died young like the horn player Dennis Brain. There’s also, amongst so many delights, an enchanting guitar concerto, and much distinguished tuneful light music, like the two sets of English Dances, and the single set of Scottish Dances.  I also like the Peterloo Overture, written for the centenary of the TUC, and commemorating, in music worthy of Shostakovich himself, the Peterloo massacre, when protesting working people were attacked by the Calvary outside Manchester. Vernon Handley and the Royal Philharmonic cope really well with a great variety of music, and this provides me with all the justification I ever needed for proposing Malcolm Arnold to the Knighthood I was thrilled he got towards the end of his life.

Beethoven: Symphonies Vol. 2Copenhagen Philharmonic/Lan ShuiOrchid Classics ORC100059 This is the eagerly awaited second volume in the Copenhagen Philharmonic’s complete cycle of Beethoven symphonies. Whereas the first volume took us through Symphonies 1 to 4, this set starts with the fateful knocking at the door opening of Symphony No.5 and ends with the closing bars of the Eighth. Conductor Lan Shui sees each of the symphonies as an evolutionary progression up to the Ninth, which will inevitably be the next and final album in the series. What makes this set different from other versions is that the orchestra swaps out its brass and timpani for copies of instruments from Beethoven’s time. The change gives such familiar works as the Pastoral Symphony with a lightness and clarity, given added emphasis by the fact that Shui adheres strictly to the composer’s instructions on dynamics and tempi. It's more like chamber music played by a full orchestra, and it's thrilling, energetic and refreshing.

Colour Me ClassicalVarious ArtistsClassic FM CFMD45Psychologists say that colouring books can help generate wellness, mindfulness and have the exact same benefits as meditation. On this double album set, there are more than two hours of soothing music, ranging from such favourites as Delibes' Flower Duet and Clair de lune, through to classical arrangements of popular songs, including John Legend's All of Me and You Raise Me Up. The unique selling point, however, is the 40 line drawings, designed to complement the selection of calming classics, and encourage you to exercise your aesthetic sensibilities.  Aled himself has even been at it.

Dvořák: Violin Concerto in A minor/Romance in F/Mazurek/Four Romantic PiecesJan Mráček/Lukáš Klánský/Czech National Symphony Orchestra/James JuddOnyx ONYX4160 Recorded in Prague, the young Czech violinist Jan Mráček here gives us pretty much all the music Dvořák wrote for solo violin. Dvořák reportedly thought more highly of his Violin Concerto than the much more celebrated concerto for cello. It's surprising that this not-so-well-known piece has so many good tunes and a beautiful slow movement. Mráček brings it to life with appropriate central European swagger and lyricism. Also included is the attractive Romance in F, and Four Romantic Pieces for violin and piano. Well played, and well worth discovering. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >   Brahms: Lieder and Liebeslieder WaltzesAndrea Rost/Magdalena Kožená/Matthew Polenzani/Thomas Quasthoff/Yefim Bronfman/James LevineDeutsche Grammophon 4796044 For years now, Martha Argerich's Lugano Festival has been the subject of an annual three-album set from EMI, now Warners, but only recently has the Verbier Festival started to issue, via DG, recordings from their archive. This one comes from 2003 and features a distinguished sextet of singers and two pianists. It's a charming, and at 81 minutes, exceptionally generous programme of songs by Brahms, centring on the two sets of Liebeslieder Waltzes. I have long loved these pieces since I came upon them by accident at a Royal Festival Hall concert back in 1971. They have great charm, and considerable melodic distinction. I have in my collection every recording, so far as I know, that has ever been issued of these elusive pieces.  I hope I can say therefore with real authority, that this ranks with the best.  An interesting and absorbing left field issue. Should you want to sample a few of the Liebeslieder Waltzes, I shall be playing a handful of them on my show on Sunday 10 July at 7pm. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Erik Satie: Piano Music, Vol.1Noriko OgawaBIS 2215 I’m a huge fan of Erik Satie, who had a big influence on Debussy, to a lesser degree on Ravel, and was an inspiration to the next generation of French composers, notably Francis Poulenc. He wrote some charming, and occasionally eccentric piano pieces.  A substantial selection of 38 of them appear on this well recorded BIS issue, which lasts a generous 78 minutes. What makes it especially interesting is that Noriko Ogawa plays on an 1890 Erard grand, of exactly the sort that Satie himself might have played. As such, this is a charming issue, as well as an extremely useful one for anyone who wants to discover the many joys of Satie’s piano music. I will be playing two Gnossiennes on Sunday evening (26 June, 8pm). If Satie is a new name to you, please listen and hopefully be as entranced as I have always been by this stuff. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Imogen Cooper's ChopinImogen CooperChandos CHAN10902 Imogen Cooper plays a generous selection, lasting over 80 minutes, of some of Chopin’s finest piano pieces, including four Nocturnes, two Ballades, the Polonaise Fantaisie, and the Berçeuse. The recording is excellent, as is Chandos’s usual manner, and Imogen Cooper is a distinguished player. However, it’s only fair to point out, at times she lingers a little too long for my liking. Hear her for yourself next Sunday 3 July 7pm, when I will be playing one of the Nocturnes, and the Berçeuse. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Iván Fischer conducts DvořákBudapest Festival Orchestra/Iván FischerDecca Eloquence ELQ4804901 Decca Eloquence emanates from Decca Australia, but they are readily available over here, and are an interesting, and relatively inexpensive way, of acquiring some of Decca’s best back catalogue items. The present batch includes a number of early orchestral recordings by Sir Georg Solti, and all are worth exploring. But for me, the pick of the crop is this Budapest Festival Orchestra issue, dating from 1999, where they are conducted in exuberant style by their founder, Iván Fischer. This fascinating double album is excellent value at almost 140 minutes, and includes fine performances of both sets of Dvořák’s Slavonic Dances, which, in the case of the first set, was the breakthrough music that gave Dvořák a European rather than a purely local reputation. The second album consists of 70 minutes of fascinating bits and pieces, including the ten Legends, which were an attempt by Dvořák to follow up on the success of the Slavonic Dances. He didn’t quite succeed in recapturing the ebullience of the earlier pieces, but these are still very good. There are also some interesting rarities, including a Notturno that plainly meant a lot to Dvořák since he rearranged it on a number of occasions, trying to get it right, and a delightful set of Prague Waltzes, consisting of four lovely pieces, that reflect his experiences as a viola player in Karel Komzak’s dance band. I shall be playing substantial extracts from this double album in my programme on 10 July and I urge you not to miss this treasurable, rare Dvorak.Buy from Amazon > Pierre Monteux conducts BrahmsLondon Symphony Orchestra/Pierre MonteuxDecca Eloquence ELQ4808911 If you're interested in hearing a really well recorded account of Brahms Second Symphony, and the Tragic and Academic Festival Overtures, conducted in good sound by a man who once played in front of Brahms in a string quartet, this is one for you. Monteux had a remarkable career. Born in 1875, he started off as a string player, converting later on to become an exceptional conductor, renowned on both sides of the Atlantic. He was already in his early 20s when Brahms died, and 65 years later, in November 1962, set down these interpretations, where the 88-year old Monteux showed no diminution in his remarkable powers, that made him one of the most renowned conductors of the first half of the twentieth century. It would be wrong to say there are special insights here denied to other conductors, but entirely right to observe that part of the joys of collecting music is to have the chance to explore important historic recordings. Anything by Monteux is well worthy of a discriminating collectors attention. Monteux was a card, who was active right up until just before his death in 1964. In 1960 he was offered the Principal Conductorship of the LSO, and accepted on the basis that was given a deal for 25 years, with an option for 25 years more! In the few years he was with them, he made some wonderful recordings, of which these are amongst the finest.Buy from Amazon > David Mellor is Opera and Classical Critic of the Mail on Sunday and presenter of his own show on Classic FM, Sundays 7pm.

CRITICS CHOICE Beethoven: Violin Sonatas Nos. 1-10Tasmin Little/Martin RoscoeChandos CHAN10888 Tasmin Little is a dedicated advocate of British violin music, but is determined not to be typecast, and this fine set of Beethoven Violin Sonatas, with the pianist Martin Roscoe proves how right she is. Here she triumphantly shows her authority in the Austro-German classics, and justifies the faith that Chandos puts in her, by investing so much in what must have been an expensive recording. Chandos also rewards her, as they always do, with outstanding sound, which shows off Tasmin’s burnished tone, and technical agility. The Beethoven Violin Sonatas attract the great violinists of every generation, and this is a hugely competitive field, in which it’s impossible to talk about a best buy. But for me, Tasmin’s set is one of the finest of recent years, and deserves the widest circulation. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > BEST OF THE RESTSibelius and Glazunov: Violin ConcertosEsther Yoo/Philharmonia Orchestra/Vladimir AshkenazyDeutsche Grammophon DG 4812157I have another good young female violinist for you, the Korean-American virtuoso Esther Yoo, still only 21.  She came to international attention 6 years ago, when aged only 16, by winning a major prize in the International Sibelius Violin Competition, the youngest player ever to do so. Inevitably then the main work here is Sibelius’s Concerto, which she plays very well, if without the command and virility that some more mature players bring to it. She is expertly accompanied by a first class Sibelian, Vladimir Ashkenazy, and the Philharmonia. What makes this album so attractive is the overall programme. It’s almost 70 minutes of enjoyable listening, with imaginatively chosen pieces to set alongside the Sibelius Concerto. For instance, she has unearthed a Sibelius Suite for violin and strings, composed in 1929, but not published until 1995. She also has the inspired idea of adding in Glazunov’s Concerto. Glazunov was born in the same year as Sibelius, and achieved huge success in Russia, as the natural successor to Tchaikovsky. He had a wonderful gift for melody, and was a brilliant orchestrator, but listeners will immediately notice there’s no great depth here, as there is in the Sibelius.  But it’s a delightfully sugary confection that should be better known.Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Introit: The Music of Gerald FinziAurora Orchestra/Nicholas CollonDecca 4789357 It’s the 60th anniversary this year of the death of Gerald Finzi, a hugely talented English pastoralist, with a wonderful knack of capturing the essence of the English countryside in his music. At one level, this album works extremely well as a birthday tribute. It spreads its net widely over a whole range of stuff, employing the talents of some exceptional musicians, like the violinist Thomas Gould and the saxophonist Amy Dickson. At nearly 77 minutes, this CD is extremely generously filled. Plus of course Nicholas Collon and the Aurora Orchestra he founded, are first class. There is however a snag. Quite a lot of the music here has been arranged by others, so you are not getting Finzi pure and simple, but a contemporary arranger’s view of Finzi. Frankly, I think that was a mistake.  Of course a lot of original Finzi remains here, and the new arrangements will please many listeners, who just want the music to flow over them as easy listening. But frankly, Finzi deserves better than this. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Vivaldi: Bassoon ConcertosGustavo Núñez/Academy of St.Martin in the FieldsPentatone PTC5186539 This joyous album is best regarded as jolly morning music, that will add a smile to your face. The bassoon always does that for me. It’s hugely difficult to play, and deserves respect, but as it burbles away like a garrulous, empty headed friend, it always makes me laugh. Gustavo Núñez, is an exceptional player.  He’s expertly accompanied by the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, slimmed down to the small, 21-player, chamber orchestra they used to be in the 60s, and directed from the leaders desk by Tomo Keller, just as Sir Neville Marriner used to do in those early days. Vivaldi wrote 39 bassoon concertos, and we only get 6 here, in what is perhaps a rather short-weight album, at only 59 minutes.  So, more please. I will be playing at least one of these concertos in a Sunday show later in March, mainly devoted to the brilliantly colourful recordings, already recommended here, that Charles Dutoit made in Montreal in the 80s and 90s, and now a newly issued Decca bargain box. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Debussy: Chamber MusicKuijken EnsembleArcana A392 This is a curiosity, but rather an enchanting one.  Six members of the Kuijken family, led by the violinist and viola player Sigiswald, playing some of Debussy’s finest chamber music. Originally recorded in 1999, I certainly didn’t notice it then, but I’m glad to have made its acquaintance now. This well filled album – 71 minutes – begins with the String Quartet from the 1890s, - and then moves on to some of the music of Debussy’s final, cancer wracked, years. He devoted his last period, in the main, to a series of sonatas, three of which are included here – the ones for Cello and Piano, Violin and Piano, and Flute, Viola and Harp. All of them make for attractive listening, but also have real depth. For instance, I especially liked the way Wieland Kuijken dug so deeply into the Cello Sonata. I am determined not to neglect chamber music in these surveys of what’s hot, and what’s not, because chamber music makes for ideal domestic listening.  And besides, a lot of composers, Debussy included, poured some of their deepest, and most imaginative thoughts into their chamber stuff.

Mozart: The SinglesVarious ArtistsDecca 4831050 No fewer than 66 classic pieces by the composer who wrote more great tunes than anyone on the planet. Every track on each of these three CDs is under four minutes in length but truly memorable, sequenced to frame the day: the first centres around tracks to wake you up; the second is uplifting while you’re on the go; while the third relaxes you into the final part of the day.

The Art of Chopin: The Piano ConcertosElizabeth Sombart/Royal Philharmonic Orchestra/Pierre ValletRPO LYD001 Chopin's two Piano Concertos made a significant impact, radically altering the course of music history. Melancholic tenderness and dreamy ecstasy are combined with stormy moments of anguish. Here, the critically acclaimed pianist Elizabeth Sombart, together with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under conductor Pierre Vallet, achieve the necessary balance of fleeting freedom and faultless precision that Chopin’s music requires. Sombart has had a lifelong fascination with Chopin, not only as a performer, but as an educator seeking to share his music with the widest possible audience. In 1998 she created the Fondation Resonnance, which now extends to seven countries offering extensive classical music outreach programmes and piano schools open to all. Her passion and deep study of this music resounds through every bar of this new recording. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  The Seattle RecitalEmil GilelsDeutsche Grammophon DG 4796288 One of the great pianists of the twentieth century, Gilels was born 100 years ago this month. DG celebrates his centenary with the issue, for the first time, of a live recital he gave in Seattle on 6 December 1964. Unlike his compatriot and rival Sviatoslav Richter, Gilels loved the US, and his sheer joy at playing in front of an enthusiastic crowd in this recital is everywhere apparent. It’s full of good things, opening with the 'Waldstein', which has great power and propulsion, and ending with two of his favourite encores; Stravinsky’s 'Russian Dance' from Pétrouchka, and Soloti’s arrangement of Bach’s B minor Prelude. In between there’s some authoritative Prokofiev - Gilels worked with the composer, and premiered one of his piano sonatas - and some delightful Debussy and Ravel. I especially like Mouvements, the third and final piece in Book 1 of Images, which combines power and balletic grace to a remarkable degree.  I don’t know a better performance on record than this, the only one, in my experience, to rival Michelangeli’s exhilarating studio recording, also for DG. This recital takes us to piano heaven. Don’t miss it. If you want a sampler, I will be playing the opening movement of the Waldstein on my Remembrance Sunday show in a fortnight’s time. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Christmas is coming, and the boxed sets are getting as fat as any Xmas goose, or indeed turkey. Sony have just issued 10 bargain boxes, none of which are turkeys, and five of which are very good. The prices are right – around £19 for the 12-album Isserlis set, and around £13 for the 5-album Janis set, but one thing isn’t. There are no notes. Okay, maybe not many people need information about our much loved cellist Steven Isserlis, but how many people these days can tell you much about Byron Janis? Black mark Sony, which mars, but only slightly, some otherwise compelling bargains.Steven Isserlis: The Complete RCA RecordingsRCA Classical Masters 88985312572 The pick of the crop here, is this 12-album set devoted to the British cellist Steven Isserlis. Isserlis recorded for RCA during the 1990s, a fascinating range of music for cello, and this is a serious lucky dip for all cello fans. As well as the two concertos by Haydn, and Saint-Saens, there’s also a fine account of Don Quixote authoritatively conducted by Lorin Maazel, and a host of cello sonatas, some of which are familiar, others most definitely not. There is also interesting excursions into Japanese music, and an invaluable album of music by the late John Tavener. It was Isserlis who premiered The Protecting Veil, arguably Tavener’s most popular work (not included here), but this album presents five other pieces well worthy of your attention. Isserlis is not only an outstanding player, he also has a fascinating musical mind, and this box will bring great pleasure. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Eric Le Sage plays Francis PoulencRCA 88985321992  Here, in very good late 1990s sound, Eric Le Sage presents all of Poulenc's piano music, chamber music, and piano concertos, including the delightful Aubade for piano and orchestra. This six-album, seven-hour set, is absolutely first class. Not necessarily better than other rivals in the solo piano music, but just so convenient, and so inexpensive. And Le Sage has some fine partners in the chamber music, especially Emmanuel Pahud in the Flute Sonata. Stravinsky, who didn’t always hand out the prizes to fellow composers, said Poulenc had the greatest melodic gift of any 20th century composer, and this box proves it time and time again. In my show on 4 December at 7pm, mainly devoted to commemorating the genius of Benjamin Britten – the day after the 40th anniversary of his death – I will also be playing Poulenc’s trio for oboe bassoon and piano, and that Flute Sonata. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Zubin Mehta conducts Richard StraussSony 88985328992 Zubin Mehta is in my view an underrated conductor, with a first class stick technique, and a great ability to galvanise orchestras, especially in romantic, and late romantic music, as here. Three of these CDs features the Berlin Philharmonic in a range of enticing stuff, including The Alpine Symphony, and both Horn Concertos. Also included is an Also sprach Zarathustra from New York, and a complete Salomé with Eva Marton. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Murray Perahia plays BeethovenSony Classical Masters 88843013312 For me, all Murray Perahia albums are self-recommending.  He takes so much time and trouble over everything he records, that his projects take a very long time to complete. This one, which features 15 of Beethoven’s Piano Sonatas, plus a major set of Variations, was recorded over 30 years. And Perahia has now left Sony, without completing the set. However, there is still an awful lot to enjoy at such a modest price.Buy from Amazon > Byron Janis: The RCA Recordings 1950-1959RCA Classical Masters 88985313302 We sometimes forget, but shouldn’t, that piano playing is a contact sport. Murray Perahia was sidelined for a few years with a finger injury that wouldn’t heal, and Byron Janis’s comet-like career in his early 20s was seriously curtailed by the onset of arthritis in both his hands. Janis was regarded in America in the 1950s as an outstanding prospect, and while this box of recordings made between 1950-1959 is perhaps for ardent pianophiles rather than the general listener, there is much to enjoy. Janis’s standing with RCA in the 1950s is attested to by the fact that his concerto recordings were made with RCAs 'A Team' – the Chicago Symphony under Fritz Reiner. Five concerto/concertante pieces are included here, and I especially enjoyed Rachmaninov's No.1, so rarely done, and so brilliantly performed, and Schumann’s Concerto, wonderfully vibrant here. This album also includes solo stuff, with a lot of Chopin (not especially interesting), Beethoven, and a coruscatingly red blooded account of Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition. What a sadness that physical infirmity prevented him building on his dazzling career later in life, though, brave guy that he is, he’s still out there May I also . ention a first class, bluesy, New York account of Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue, all the better because neither he, nor his conductor Hugo Winterhalter, hangs about. I will be playing that on my Christmas Day show. Well worth hearing.

Mozart: Three Salzburg Symphonies Nos. 21, 27 and 34Haydn Sinfonietta Wien/Manfred HussBIS 2218 Given how popular Mozart is, it's extraordinary how little of his music we actually know. He wrote at least 41 symphonies, but of those only the last five or six have truly captured the public imagination, and a lot of the early ones – such as those featured here – are never done at all. For instance, Nos. 21 and 27 were composed when he was 16-17. The Vienna-based original instrument ensemble the Haydn Sinfonietta give thrilling performances here, originally released in 2006. What's new here is No. 34, composed in Salzburg when Mozart was in his mid-twenties, with a minuet added to give the symphony a proper four-movement feel, as was the case in Mozart’s day.Order from iTunes >Order from Amazon >  After 6pm each weekday evening on Classic FM Drive, John showcases a track from the Drive Discovery, a fantastic new release. Cinema Classics: The Piano At The MoviesSee Siang WongSony 8898535612 This is tremendously good value – a double album featuring 24 arrangements for piano of classic movie themes, played by the Chinese pianist See Siang Wong. The range spans the decades – from Pachelbel (as used in Ordinary People) through to Inception. And a piano version of the Adagietto from Mahler's Symphony No.5 (Death in Venice) works surprisingly well. This is pleasing, relaxing listening, perfect as the soundtrack to a nice drink on a warm, summer's evening. And at the price, well worth acquiring. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Tchaikovsky: Piano Concerto No.2/Concert FantasiaEldar Nebolsin/New Zealand Symphony Orchestra/Michael SternNaxos 8.557824 This Naxos issue is a real winner because of Eldar Nebolsin’s barnstorming performances of two of Tchaikovsky's most underrated pieces. The second Piano Concerto has a certain following, but usually appears in a heavily edited version, with the slow movement cut in half, as a result of the publication of a revised score by Tchaikovsky's pupil Siloti – unauthorised by the composer – which appeared only after his death. Tchaikovsky was always prone to suggestions by pianists that his music was flawed. No.1 was originally described as unplayable. As for No.2, the slow movement was heavily criticised because much of the most beautiful thematic material is given to a solo cello and solo violin rather than the piano. Happily though this performance, where Nebolsin is accompanied by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra conducted by Michael Stern, is given complete, and lasts almost 43 minutes. This CD is a real winner, not just for Nebolsin's playing, but because of the addition of the totally overlooked Concert Fantasia. This two-movement piece, lasting half an hour, is full of good things. It may be brash but most Tchaikovsky fans will really enjoy it, and this is a great opportunity to get to know this fine piece inexpensively. Well worth it if you have have never heard it before.Buy from Amazon >  Complete Chamber Music RecordingsMaria João Pires/Various ArtistsDeutsche Grammophon DG 4795964  Maria João Pires is a refined classicist at the opposite end of the pianistic spectrum to Nebolsin. But then she wouldn't play Tchaikovsky, and somebody has to. He, one suspects, wouldn't want to get involved in most of the chamber music featured here. This is a fine selection of sonatas, trios and quintets etc, mainly featuring Pires with her partner of several years, the violinist Augustin Dumay. There's a complete Beethoven Violin Sonata set, a range of other sonatas with Dumay, and some trios where they are joined by the cellist Jian Wang. There's also an interesting collection of Schuman pieces for oboe and piano with Douglas Boyd. This is a self-recommending issue, containing ideal, calming summer listening.  Pires's pianism has such poise and is so stylish throughout, to be able to get this 12-album box for under £40 is a formidable bargain. Buy from Amazon >  Pinchas Zukerman: Complete Recordings on Deutsche Grammophon and PhilipsPinchas Zukerman/Various ArtistsDeutsche Grammophon DG 4795983 Pinchas Zukerman had a phenomenal career as a young violinist and viola player, working with friends like Daniel Barenboim and Itzhak Perlman. Recently, aged 68, he has come back into the limelight a bit, still playing the violin very well, and conducting a lot around America and elsewhere. Most of these recordings date from the 1970s and 80s, but are none the worst for that. There’s a good selection of pieces, ranging from baroque concertos by Telemann and Vivaldi – where Zukerman also directs the St Paul Chamber Orchestra – through to lightweight encore pieces, with the pianist Marc Neikrug. In between there are popular concertos by Brahms, Sibelius and others, and a particularly enticing set of Brahms Violin Sonatas with Barenboim. This set of 22 albums costs £50 or less. At that price it's a serious bargain, well presented, in a handsome box.Buy from Amazon > Elgar RemasteredSomm SOMM261-4This four-album collection reflects a great deal of work by American engineer Lani Spahr, remastering test pressings from Elgar's private library. These include alternative, previously unissued sides of – among others – the Symphony No.1, the Violin Concerto, the Enigma Variations, and the Cello Concerto. Some of the material however has been remastered in artificial stereo, which is a mixed blessing. This has obviously been a labour of love not just for Spahr, but Arthur Reynolds, Chairman of the North American branch of the Elgar Society. Elgar enthusiasts will welcome this issue, even if, I suspect they won't return to it very much. As Chairman of the Elgar Foundation, I'm glad to have this set and praise the energy and enthusiasm that has gone into it.

Fantasies, Rhapsodies and DaydreamsArabella Steinbacher/Orchestre Philharmonique de Monte-Carlo/Lawrence FosterPentatone PTC5186536 One of today's most brilliant violin virtuosos gives us an album of bravura playing, show-stopping melodies and, at times, wistful lyricism. Steinbacher's formidable technique ranges across eras and styles, from the incendiary showmanship of Waxman's Carmen Fantasie and Sarasate's Zigeunerweisen, to the fearsome technical demands yet subtle beauty of the nation's favourite classical piece, Vaughan Williams's The Lark Ascending. The Méditation from Thaïs is also here, given a spellbinding performance.

The muscians stand up to play, which Gardiner notes, ""gives a different type of dynamism and energy... it means that the fiddles are freer in the way that they attack the extremely virtuosic lines and it gives a tremendous sense of occasion to the music making."" Mendelssohn’s First Symphony, written when he was 14, is given here in a unique format, with both the original and revised versions of the third movement. The Fourth Symphony is among the best loved of all the composer’s works. Certainly Gardiner's performance here brings out all the sights, sounds and atmosphere of Italy, as Mendelssohn found it.

Tchaikovsky: Symphony No.6 in B minor, 'Pathetique/Borodin: Polovtsian DancesBudapest Festival Orchestra, Iván FischerChannel CCSSA37016 When Tchaikovsky stepped onto the stage in Saint Petersburg on 28 October 1893 to introduce his Sixth Symphony to the public, he was received with a roar of applause. Three quarters of an hour later the astonished audience was dumbfounded. How could a symphony begin so softly and end even more so? And what about the second movement with its un-danceable waltz, and the third with its unstoppable march? Nine days after the premiere, Tchaikovsky died in a city ravaged by cholera. The full gamut of emotion and colour is captured in this superb new recording of the 'Pathetique' by Iván Fischer with his Budapest Festival Orchestra.

Better AngelsEmily Pailthorpe/BBC Symohony Orchestra and BBCSO Soloists/Martyn BrabbinsChamps Hill Records CHRCD116  This fascinating album is a tribute both to the skills of the oboist Emily Pailthorpe, and the commitment of David and Mary Bowerman to producing some marvellous recordings on their Champs Hill Records label. The Bowermans have built a delightful concert hall at their Sussex home, which doubles as a recording studio, allowing them to produce more than 100 recordings of a variety of music. In one sense, this album marks a further step forward, since some of these works require a symphony orchestra, and had to be recorded in London. Hats off to David and Mary for the efforts they make to allow artists to make recordings who might not otherwise get the chance, and to allow us to hear works that might not otherwise get recorded, such as Richard Blackford's newly composed Oboe Concerto. But Blackford is not the real reason for buying this album.  That is provided by four fascinating pieces of tonal, 20th century music either for oboe and accompaniment, or, as in Janáček’s Mládí, (Youth) and Barber’s Summer Music, where the oboe is part of a small instrumental ensemble. Mládí is a fascinating piece for six wind instruments, and considering how warmly lyrical it is, and how fashionable Janáček is in operatic circles, it’s surprising it’s not better known. The same is probably true of Richard Strauss’ late Oboe Concerto, a little gem that once again a lot of people familiar with Strauss’s symphonic poems, and some of his better known operas, might not know.  It receives a fine performance here. But the real gems on this recording are two pieces by Samuel Barber. His Summer Music is perhaps not as lyrical as his finest pieces, but quirky and well worth exploring. The jewel in the crown is Barber’s Canzonetta, the slow movement of a projected oboe concerto, which the composer’s alcoholism and depression meant he was unable to finish before his death. It is a delicious piece, and a great discovery.Buy from Amazon > Handel; The Great OratoriosDecca 4830142 This 41-album box is invaluable for those who wish to explore not just well known pieces including Messiah, but more obscure works of great stature such as Alexander’s Feast, Israel in Egypt and Judas Maccabaeus. Here, in another irresistible bargain box from Decca, they draw on a series of distinguished recordings that begin in 1976 with Judas Maccabaeus, and conclude with two recordings from 2000, Theodora, and Hercules. All the best of the usual Handel suspects are to be found here, with conductors of the stature of the late, lamented Sir Charles Mackerras, Sir John Eliot Gardiner, Trevor Pinnock, Harry Christophers and Marc Minkowski, amongst others, and too many distinguished singers to mention. This is a feast, and will offer a lifetime of listening pleasure at extremely modest cost. Readily available online for £99 or less. Buy from Amazon > Martha Argerich Chopin: The complete Deutsche Grammophon recordingsDeutsche Grammophon DG4796068 As one of the great pianists of our age, Martha Argerich has always had a soft spot for Chopin. Her victory at the age of 23 in the 1965 Chopin International Competition in Warsaw projected her to the top of the ranks of thrilling young pianists. Chopin plays to her strengths, because it allows her to show formidable virtuosity, and also her ability to take an original view of the interpretation of even the best known works. Chopin, one suspects, played his own music really flexibly, and so does Argerich, which makes most of these recordings from 1959–2000 so special. The great sadness is that Argerich gave up playing live solo piano recitals more than 35 years ago. I caught one of the last of them in Stresa, Italy, in the late 1970s, and shall never forget the extraordinary, tigerish way she pounced on Chopin’s Third Piano Sonata, one of the finest offerings here. Really there is nothing more to say. Just put these recordings on and be transported to a different world; sometimes a wayward one, but always a world worth exploring. Buy from Amazon >  The Sun Most Radiant: Music from the Eton Choirbook, Vol.4Choir of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford/Stephen DarlingtonAvie AV2359 One of the great glories of British music making at the moment is the proliferation of outstanding choirs, both large and small, the length and breadth of the country, and the exciting range of music they record. Stephen Darlington’s Christ Church Cathedral Choir is one of at least a dozen in Oxford alone, worthy of being recorded, as they triumphantly prove here with another volume of offerings from the Eton Choirbook, a vast collection of English sacred music from the early renaissance. This almost 70-minute offering focuses especially on John Browne, who was writing music between 1480-1505. Alongside two other obscure names to most ley people – William Horwood and William Stratford – Darlington and his team offer some fascinating music. Not necessarily totally memorable, or music that will linger long in your memory after the album has finished, the impact is simply the beauty of what is on display, and the sheer quality of the music making, that allows us to reach back more than 500 years to reinvigorate ourselves in an entirely different musical world, with a religious sense, very different to our own. This is for the adventurous, but almost anyone with a taste for choral music will find much to enjoy here.Buy from Amazon > David Mellor is Opera and Classical Critic of the Mail on Sunday and presenter of his own show on Classic FM, Sundays 7pm.

English FantasyEmma JohnsonNimbus Alliance NI6328 The superb clarinettist Emma Johnson has put together this programme of attractive and accessible works written especially for her by some of our leading composers. There's a concerto from Classic FM favourite Patrick Hawes, Paul Reade's popular Suite from The Victorian Kitchen Garden, Will Todd's blues and funk-inspired Concerto for Emma, and an equally jazzy Woolwich Concerto by the late John Dankworth. The fact that these pieces were composed with her in mind means that the music sounds very natural in her hands. It's refreshing to find modern music which is melodic and at the same time has something new and refreshing to say. The melodic approach roots the music in the English traditions of the past while at the same time giving us delightful new repertoire for the clarinet to savour.

Vaughan Williams: Coastal CommandRTÉ Concert Orchestra/Andrew PennyNaxos Film Music Classics 8573658Vaughan Williams composed in a wide range of genres and film music became a significant part of his output in the latter decades of a long and distinguished career. He took film scores seriously, seeking to “intensify the spirit of the whole” in wartime productions such as the defiantly ant-Nazi 49th Parallel and Coastal Command, in which the graceful romance of sea-planes sends the spirits soaring.

The endless stream of bumper bargain boxes continues, with a 59 album-set featuring all of the recordings the great Australian guitarist John Williams made for Sony and its predecessors between 1964 and 2006.  A fine bargain at £101 (or maybe less online). Even better value is the Philips 50 CD Analogue Collection, because those 50 CDs only cost £84, or £1.68 per CD. It’s almost embarrassing that they can give recordings of such quality away at such prices. And it’s not over: already, in my hot sticky little hands, for future review, is an excellent 35 album Decca box of all the outstanding recordings Charles Dutoit made in Montreal during the 80s.   CRITIC'S CHOICE John Williams - The Complete Album CollectionJohn Williams (guitar)Sony   I have a soft spot for the guitarist John Williams. When in my teens, after a spot of under age drinking, a friend introduced me to the joys of Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez, I was hooked for life. I went out the following day and bought the John Williams version, and it’s been a constant friend for almost 50 years. Williams doesn’t just do pretty-pretty things. There’s some cutting edge stuff as well.  He reveals himself not only as a master guitarist, but as an exceptional musician of wide sensibilities.  The release of this box has now been delayed to mid-March, so start saving your pennies now.  You won’t regret it. I’m playing the slow movement on my Sunday show at 7pm, as well as two other extracts from this wonderful box; a Suite for Two Guitars by the English composer William Lawes, who was killed in the English Civil War, arranged for Williams and Julian Bream to play by Bream himself; and an arrangement for guitar and string orchestra of Schubert’s Arpeggione Sonata, transcribed by Williams, and the English composer Christopher Gunning, most celebrated for writing the Poirot theme. It’s an absolute joy in this form.Buy from Amazon >  BEST OF THE REST Dvořák, Suk, Janáček: String QuartetsThe Wihan QuartetNimbus Alliance NI6322 The Wihan Quartet are working their way through Slavonic chamber music for Nimbus Alliance, and this new issue is one of the most attractive. It features one of Dvorak’s finest string quartets, one of the two Janacek quartets, subtitled The Kreutzer Sonata after Tolstoy’s short story, and a short ramble on an old Czech hymn tune from Dvorak’s son-in-law Josef Suk. Most people who listen to classical music only know Dvorak’s American Quartet.  Please don’t just confine yourself to this.  Dvorak wrote lots of other delightful chamber music, as did Suk, and of course Smetana, not featured here. Sometimes the Wihan’s sound is a bit astringent, but this remains an attractive investment for the curious. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Sun Moon Sea and Stars - Songs and arrangements by Bob ChilcottTenebrae ConsortSignum Bene Arte SIGCD903 Bob Chilcott has been somewhat overshadowed, and unfairly so, by John Rutter. Chilcott too can write a good tune, and is not embarrassed about doing so. He is also an extremely clever arranger of other people’s stuff, as is everywhere apparent on this delightful 22 song album, featuring arrangements by Jerome Kern, George Gershwin and others, as well as original songs by Chilcott himself. Most of them, even quite well versed listeners won’t know, so if you respond to the music of John Rutter, and want to discover his musical cousin, this is a great opportunity to do so. Tenebrae, directed by their founder Nigel Short, are predictably excellent throughout. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >   Domenico Scarlatti: Piano SonatasYevgeny SudbinBISCD 1508 It has taken Domenico Scarlatti a long time to become an overnight success – 259 years to be precise. Scarlatti left us 555 sonatas.  Recordings arrive fitfully, picking out the plums from this extraordinary range of music.  But, with two coming in the same month, maybe his time has finally arrived.  Sudbin presents 18 of them here, and makes an excellent fist of all of them. He is a truly exceptional pianist, and I urge anyone who enjoys J.S. Bach on the piano to sample this music, much of which, if it never surpasses Bach, does often rival him.  And extraordinarily, their lives almost precisely overlapped. Why is Scarlatti so much less well known? Obviously he didn’t have Bach’s range, but for keyboard music, his is a talent we should be more familiar with. This excellent album is a start for a long voyage of exploration. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Philips: The Analogue Collection  For more than 50 years, the Eindhoven based electronics giant Philips licensed their name for a classical record label which, latterly as a sister company to DG and Decca, produced some wonderful recordings, with musicians whose contributions to our musical life has endured, in many cases, well beyond their death.  I think of the Soviet pianist Sviatoslav Richter, whose 1958 live recital from Sofia, includes a coruscating account of Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition has never been bettered.  Similarly, the late Antal Dorati‘s complete Nutcracker, with the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, Philips’ house orchestra, shows this conductor, who led the Ballets Russes in the 30s, at his finest.   There are so many gems here, it’s hard to know where to begin and end, but think about conductors like Bernard Haitink happily still with us, or the late Colin Davis, think about pianists like the now retired Alfred Brendel, or the violinist Arthur Grumiaux, and you have got musicians who rarely, if ever, produced a bad recording. There are so many joys here, I could go on and on but I won’t.  I am just saying buy this box. This is a complete no brainer, and in a couple of weeks I am going to be devoting most of my Sunday programme to some of the many joys of this brilliant trip down memory lane.

This album spreads its net widely over a whole range of works, employing the talents of some exceptional musicians, including the violinist Thomas Gould and the saxophonist Amy Dickson.

Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >     Critic's Choice Elgar and Walton: Cello ConcertosSteven Isserlis/Philharmonia Orchestra/Paavo JärviHyperion CDA68077 Steven Isserlis returns to the Elgar Concerto 20 years after his last recording, and the added maturity he brings to bear is everywhere apparent. Indeed this is one of the most satisfying recordings this now much loved work has received. Isserlis’s admiration for the piece is conveyed, not just in his playing, with the Philharmonia under Paavo Jarvi, but also in a vigorous liner note, which makes much of the fiasco of the first performance. Isserlis blames the conductor Albert Coates for taking up all the rehearsal time for his part of the concert, leaving Elgar, who was conducting, and the soloist Felix Salmond, too little time to work on the piece, with an under-prepared orchestra. The Sunday Times critic Ernest Newman wrote; “Never has so great an orchestra made so lamentable a public exhibition of itself!” Lady Elgar was especially upset with Coates, and died within a few months.  Isserlis wears his heart on his sleeve here, declaring, tongue in cheek, that Coates should have been charged with her manslaughter! This exceptional 73-minute issue finds room not just for Walton’s underrated Cello Concerto, composed in 1956 for the Russian/American virtuoso Gregor Piatigorsky, but also for Holst’s Invocation, and his daughter Imogen Holst’s Fall Of The Leaf (1963) for solo cello, that Isserlis played at the composers 70th birthday back in 1977. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Best of the Rest Haydn: ConcertosIl Pomo d'OroErato 2564605204 Haydn is arguably the most underappreciated great composer. He was so prolific that much music of real quality he composed passes unnoticed. True of almost everything on this fine album by the original instrument group Il Pomo d'Oro, founded in 2012. Their two joint conductors, the violinist Riccardo Minasi, and the harpsichordist Maxim Emelyanychev, do the honours in these two well filled albums, offering five of Haydn’s concertos, helpfully excluding the three best known ones (the two for cello and the one for trumpet), in favour of two keyboard concertos, a concerto for violin, one for violin and keyboard, and one for horn. All worth hearing, and the second keyboard concerto is especially fine. I shall be playing the first movement of this one in Sunday’s show from 7pm. The roster is completed by Symphony No.83 ('The Hen'), which also falls under the shadow, as do almost all his other symphonies, of the extraordinarily popularity of the last ""London"" set. All in all a bracing, and stimulating set, that deserves wide circulation. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Dvorak: Violin Concerto/Romanza; Suk: Fantasy Christian Tetzlaff/Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra/John StorgärdsOndine ODE12795 Quite a month for concerto albums, and here's another one.  Christian Tetzlaff makes a fine fist of Dvorak's underrated Violin Concerto, that I have long loved, and so want more people to get into.  In its way it is as fine as the immensely popular Cello Concerto. The couplings are generous - Dvorak’s Romance, which is a delightful piece, like an alternative slow movement for the concerto, and Josef Suk’s Fantasy.  Entirely appropriate this, since Suk was Dvorak’s son-in-law. The accompaniment from John Storgärds and the Helsinki Philharmonic is entirely idiomatic. This well filled 66-minute album is worth acquiring or downloading for those who want to move a little bit off the beaten track, but don’t want anything to frighten the horses. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Benjamin Britten: Young Apollo/Lachrymae for viola & strings/Prelude & Fugue for 18 strings/Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings Lorenzo Soulès/Máté Szücs/Richard Watkins/Allan Clayton/Aldeburgh Strings/Markus DäunertLinn CKD478 This enjoyable album, including some Britten rarities like Young Apollo and the Prelude and Fugue, draws on recordings made at the Snape Maltings between October 2012 and April 2015. It's fairly short weight at only 55 minutes, but any concerns about that should be set aside, because of the exceptional performance here of the Serenade, one of the great masterpieces of British music. The tenor Allan Clayton, is an artist for whom I have the highest regard, because of both the quality of his voice and his calibre as a musician.  And the playing of the hornists Richard Watkins is also truly exceptional. The opening phrase of the serenade’s Pastoral makes clear that Clayton is blessed with the same sort of high tenor voice as the singer for whom the piece was written, Britten’s partner Peter Pears, but without what I can only describe as the strangulated, drowning-the-cat, timbres that, if truth be told, irritated all but Pears’ most dedicates admirers. As such, this is a performance so worth treasuring, that even if you don’t want the whole album, you should download this. By the way, this recording mainly features the Aldeburgh Strings, a group put together from visiting musicians, rather as they do at Bayreuth, so the viola player Mate Szucs plays in the Berlin Philharmonic, whilst the director, the violinist Markus Daunert, is leader of both the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, and the Lucerne Festival Orchestra. Quite a pedigree. Buy from Amazon > Softly Awakes My Heart: Very Best of Marian AndersonMarian AndersonAlto Take:2 ALN1955 Marion Anderson was a wonderful pioneer, a glorious contralto who almost single-handedly broke the mould that in her younger days barred black singers from most of America’s lyric theatres, even the Met. By the end of her career she was hailed as a great American as well as a wonderful singer. In her younger days she was regarded as an embarrassment; a woman who lived in the land of the free but it wasn’t so free if you were black, however talented. These songs, including a few patriotic ones, as well as some arias, show the power of her voice and the quality of her musicianship.  The tragedy is that she never sang much opera, because she felt she hadn’t been properly trained for it.  Our loss as well as hers. A great and glorious voice, which at Alto prices, any lover of great singing should explore.   Buy from Amazon > David Mellor is Opera and Classical Critic of the Mail on Sunday and presenter of his own show on Classic FM, Sundays 7pm.

Every weekday morning after 10am, John plays a track from Classic FM's Album of the Week. Karl Jenkins: Cantata Memoria - For the ChildrenDG 4796486 Cantata Memoria commemorates through new music the Aberfan tragedy of 21 October 1966, when 116 children and 28 adults tragically lost their lives as a coal tip enveloped Plant Glas school, together with some houses, in Aberfan, South Wales. This large-scale choral work – in English, Welsh and Latin – has been commissioned by S4C, the Welsh language TV channel, to mark the 50th anniversary of what has become known to subsequent generations – both in the UK and around the world – as the Aberfan Disaster. Listen to Karl Jenkins's heartbreaking memorial to the 116 children and 28 adults who died in Aberfan in 1966 > In one of the first large-scale works since the hugely successful The Armed Man – A mass for Peace, this special and profoundly emotional new work features bass-baritone Bryn Terfel and harpist Catrin Finch, as well as a host of children and adult voices. Though written to commemorate a specific and profoundly sad event, the emotions and themes in this special music resonates beyond, reflecting the universal sensation of loss and the journey from darkness to light.

Dolce VitaJonas Kaufmann/Orchestra del Teatro Massimo di Palermo/Asher FischSony 88875183642 The biggest opera star in the world returns with a brand new album of favourite Italian songs – his own personal homage to a culture where the influence and beauty of opera are felt far beyond the walls of the opera houses. There’s lots to enjoy in this generous collection of popular numbers, including such immortal songs as 'Con Te Partiro', 'Parla Piu Piana' from The Godfather, 'Catari Catari', Caruso and many more. Asher Fisch and the Orchestra del Teatro Massimo di Palermo bring innate Italian flair to the accompaniment. A must for Kaufmann fans and anyone who enjoys good tunes well sung. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Schumann/Bach/BrahmsMartha Argerich/Itzhak PerlmanWarner Classics 9029593789 Perlman and Argerich have not played much together, which, on the evidence of this album is a shame. When I interviewed Perlman for Classic FM in the spring, when he chose a Full Works Concert for us, he made clear his admiration for the Argentinian pianist.  That shines through this connoisseur’s programme of Schumann’s Violin Sonata No1, recorded in New York in 1998, and then some more Schumann, with Bach and Brahms recorded as recently as last March in Paris. Argerich is on cracking form here, with her technique showing no signs of the ravages of time, despite her recently celebrating her 75th birthday. Perlman, who turned 71 in August, also sounds well.  Perhaps, in my favourite piece, the Scherzo Brahms wrote for the so called FAE Sonata, in the big tune in the middle section, his tone lacks the soaring beauty of yesterday.  But he remains a player of great accomplishment, and this album, though a bit short weight at 51 minutes, places before us once again two artists of such quality, any lover of chamber music should hear these recordings.Download from iTunes > Buy from Amazon > Thomas Tallis: Spem In Alium and other sacred musicThe Cardinall’s Musick /Andrew CarwoodHyperion CDA68156 This Hyperion issue to be released on 29 October is another sure fire winner from Andrew Carwood and his outstanding choir, taking further their Tallis edition, that will ultimately record all of this great British polyphonist’s known works. This typically generous 77-minute album, focuses on Tallis's 40 part motet, Spem In Alium, and you get two versions here; the Latin one, most of us know, and a rare English texted version, Sing and Glorify. Room is also found for more than a dozen other shorter works, and anyone who loves to wallow in the Great British choral tradition should not hesitate. I sense this could well be a potential award winner. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >InflectionsTamara Konstantin/Duncan HoneybourneStone Records ST8066 Tamara Konstantin trained as a pianist in Georgia, before later building successful careers as a TV presenter, and a senior executive in an oil company. Now a long-time resident of the UK, living with her successful businessman husband in Dorset, Tamara some years ago returned to music, re-honing her pianistic technique, and also composing. The fruits of her labours first appeared on a privately circulated CD, recommended to me by a Classic FM colleague, and from which I played one item, Spring, from her piano Four Seasons. This went down very well and attracted a positive postbag, so I played it again, with the same result. I am therefore glad that this album is now being made more widely available through Stone Records.  Anyone who buys it, or downloads it, is in for a treat. Tamara is inspired by the great piano masters of the 19th century, to produce melodic music, well laid out for the piano, that is not in the least derivative, and has great charm. These days, thankfully, with atonalism seen as a blind alley, we can celebrate the return of well crafted melodies which is what you get here. Tamara shares pianistic duties with the Dorset pianist Duncan Honeybourne, a most accomplished pianist, who has himself recorded some interesting CDs, well worth digging out, of English romantic piano music on EM Records. Buy from Amazon > Irish Piano ConcertosMichael McHale/RTE National Symphony Orchestra/Courtney LewisRTÉ Lyric CD150 Another who believes in the power of melody, but not used sentimentally, is the Irish composer Philip Hammond (not that one!) His Piano Concerto, composed in 2014 for Michael McHale, makes for attractive listening, all the more so, because it is neither simplistic, nor without its challenges.  I thoroughly enjoyed it. The principal work here is the Irish 19th century composer John Field’s Piano Concerto No3. Field was an itinerant virtuoso, who spent much of his life in Russia and Eastern Europe.  He is credited with inventing the Nocturne, and indeed the second movement of this concerto is one of his nocturnes arranged for piano and orchestra by McHale himself, because this third concerto does not have a slow movement.  Musicologists believe that Field would have played one of his nocturnes as a slow movement, or extemporised. The first movement doesn’t have that much distinction, but the third movement, a Polish polacca dance, is full of good things, and I will be playing that bit of the movement in one of my Sunday programmes in November. Buy from Amazon >Download from iTunes > The LegendFritz WunderlichProfil Medien PH07024 My reissue of the week is devoted to the tragically short lived German tenor Fritz Wunderlich. Wunderlich had already established himself as an exceptional artist across a wide range of music, encompassing opera and operetta, as well as Lieder. On the eve of his 36th birthday, he was found dead at the bottom of a flight of stone steps in a hunting lodge in Southern Germany.  Mystery surrounds his death to this day.  Was it just a stumble following an evening of alcoholic excess, or was there something more sinister to it?  Rumours abound of a quarrel with a fellow singer over a woman.  Fascinating stuff, but I suppose we will never know the truth. But there’s another truth we can state with certainty, and that is Wunderlich’s exceptional quality as a singer, which is everywhere apparent in this generous 3CD set. Volume 1 is devoted to opera, ranging from Mozart to Massenet and Tchaikovsky, with a bit of Puccini thrown in. Volume 2 has some wonderful arias from the operettas of Lehar, Johann Strauss the younger, and lesser well known figures like Leo Fall and Carl Millocker. Volume 3 is devoted mainly to Lieder, and contains some fine songs by Schubert, Wolf and Richard Strauss. Handily priced, and with comfortably over 3 hours of music, this is not to be missed by any lover of great singing. I defy anyone to listen to any of these tracks without appreciating what an appalling tragedy for music Wunderlich’s early death really was.

Sol Gabetta: CelloSol Gabetta/Various ArtistsSony 88985342962Sol Gabetta is a stunning cellist, and this is an exceptional compilation of the great work she has already achieved in the recording studio so far in her short career. In addition to Elgar's evergreen Cello Concerto, here are also some Elgar salon works, and a couple of really worthwhile short pieces by Dvorak: Silent Woods and the Rondo. The second album is mainly given over to short encore pieces such as, inevitably, Saint-Saens's The Swan, and less obviously, Pablo Casals's beautiful reworking of a Catalan folk song, The Song of the Birds. Truly exceptional, and no cello lover should miss this. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > After 6pm each weekday evening on Classic FM Drive, John showcases a track from the Drive Discovery, a fantastic new release. W.H. Squire: Miniatures for cello and pianoOliver Gledhill/Tadashi ImaiNaxos 8571373 William Henry Squire was Britain’s leading cellist from the late 1890s to the late 1920s and a prolific artist in the early recording era. He composed a series of exquisite miniatures for the cello, the best of which are collected here for the first time. They were written largely between the ages of 18 and 33, often with specific audiences in mind – whether Promenade Concerts, recital platform or grade examinations – and include his signature piece, Sérénade, and his enigmatic tribute to Dvořák, Chansonnette. Five of the 20 have never before been recorded so this really is quite a discovery, and quite an achievement for young cellist, Oliver Gledhill. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Shostakovich/Glazunov: Violin ConcertosNicola Benedetti/Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra/Kirill KarabitsDecca 4788758 This is surely Nicola Benedetti’s finest album yet. No more twee, soft-centred collections, like Homecoming and The Silver Violin. Instead two contrasted, but interlinked, Russian concertos, that vividly tell the story of the travails which that unfortunate country went through in the first half of the 20th century. Glazunov’s sugary concerto from 1904 is full of good tunes, beautifully laid out for both soloist and orchestra. It proves why Glazunov was regarded in his own time as Tchaikovsky’s successor. Benedetti’s tone may not be as beautiful as some in this music, but she digs as deep as the piece allows, and is well partnered by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra under Kirill Karabits.  This is a real success. WATCH: Nicola Benedetti thinks you need the Glazunov Violin Concerto in your life - and is here to tell why > Shostakovich’s Violin Concerto No.1 is a work of searing intensity created in an entirely different Russia, 40 years later. Shostakovich was then under immediate threat of transportation to one of Stalin’s gulags, or worse. He devised a clever way of surviving by writing conformist music to be performed immediately, and other more subversive stuff 'for the drawer', as he put it. This concerto lay there for seven years until Stalin was safely dead. Its premiere by the great David Oistrakh rightly created a sensation. It’s fiendishly difficult to play. Even Oistrakh, whom I saw live frequently, and who was built like an all-in wrestler had to beg for mercy and insist an orchestral passage was put in between the long cadenza, and the exhausting finale, to give him a rest. It’s a tribute to the fragile looking Benedetti how much power she can bring to bear in what has to be regarded as a real success for her, showing her formidable powers in an entirely different light. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Summer Night Concert 2016Vienna Philharmonic/Semyon BychkovSony 88985313542 The Strauss family-dominated New Year’s Day Concert from Vienna has long been a nice little earner for the Vienna Philharmonic, with recordings, speedily produced, sold all over the world. In recent years, anxious to create another bonanza, the Vienna Phil has taken to giving an early summer concert in the gardens of the city’s beautiful Schönbrunn Palace. The 2016 one took place as recently as 26 May but is now available, well packaged, with some lovely photos, and containing far and away the best music making of this series so far. It’s a French programme entrusted to the Paris based conductor Semyon Bychkov, who makes a terrific fist of a programme that mixes up lightweight and more serious items. For instance, as well as Ravel’s Daphnis and Chloe Suite No.2, a genuine masterpiece, there's the same composer’s Bolero, sounding really well with some classy Viennese playing. There’s also Francis Poulenc’s Concerto for Two Pianos, astonishingly getting its Vienna Philharmonic debut, with some perhaps less than poetic playing from the Labèque sisters, the only blot on this particular landscape. But all is forgiven with bubbly stuff like Offenbach’s Can Can, the Farandole from Bizet’s L'Arlésienne Suite, and the one concession to Vienna, the delicious Wiener Blut waltz, given an especially delightful encore performance here. Almost 80 minutes of often magical music making. Music for a summer evening? Emphatically, yes. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  25 Years of Europakonzert 1991–2015Berlin Philharmonic OrchestraEuroArts Europakonzert 8024260988 The Berlin Philharmonic are also only too well aware of the commercial benefits of creating a concert series that captures the imagination, and then turning out CDs, or in this case DVDs, to a worldwide audience. Twenty-five years ago the Europakonzert, to coincide with May Day, was inaugurated, and this EuroArts set includes DVDs of the TV transmissions of all the concerts from 1991-2015, that take place in a different European city each year. There is a formidable roster of conductors and soloists involved.  Not just Abbado and Rattle, the relevant music directors, but Boulez, Barenboim, Haitink, Mehta, and Jansons, and also some distinguished soloists as well. Twenty-five DVDs for around £70 is pretty good value if you enjoy looking at concert or opera DVDs. I don’t personally. I prefer just to listen to music rather than look at the actual music making itself on a screen. There also has to be the question about how many times you want to watch the same concert.  But if this is the sort of thing you like, you will like this sort of thing. There is much to admire here. Buy from Amazon > Brahms: The Violin SonatasChristian Tetzlaff/Lars VogtOndine ODE12842 This is a mightily impressive album that I am giving a first play to on my programme (Sunday 10 July, 7pm), when I will be featuring the Scherzo from the so called FAE Sonata for which Brahms composed a single movement when he was 20, the opening movement of the first sonata composed when Brahms was 45, and the slow movement of the third sonata composed when he was 55. Tetzlaff is a very searching interpreter, so all of the performances here sound freshly minted.  He really does dig deep into the music in a way a lot of even quite distinguished violinists don’t. He is exceptionally well partnered by the pianist and conductor Lars Vogt who is also a musician of real stature, as those lucky enough to see him perform with his new charges, the Royal Northern Sinfonia can readily attest. At the pinnacle of the violin repertoire, the Brahms sonatas offer a competitive field. But this recording goes to the top, or very near it, and the attractions of the playing are greatly helped by extensive notes, including a conversation with both artists, and also very good sound. Buy from Amazon > ReconnectionRuth McGinleyLyte Records LR037 The Ulster pianist Ruth McGinley won major prizes as a teenager, and went out on the concert circuit in the 90s/early noughties. She then, understandably enough, found the pressure getting to her, and stepped back a bit from her career, to bring up a child, and reconsider her future. In recent years she’s gone back to performing, as the accompanist to the bestselling group The Priests, and doing lots of other work in Northern Ireland, that only now does she feel confident enough to produce a solo album.  Hence, the title, Reconnection. In reconnecting with her past as a soloist on this disc, she does really well, playing some straight forwardly classical pieces, and also some charming lighter things, with music by Randy Newman, Gershwin, and Charlie Chaplin. I shall be playing the Randy Newman piece, and the Gershwin one, in an arrangement of serpentine complexities by the great American pianist Earl Wild. This very well recorded album makes for ideal quiet, downtime listening. I hope this is a success for her, and she makes some further reconnections with her listening public.

Fučík studied violin in his early years, switching later to the bassoon, with a bit of percussion and timpani on the side. Playing in Austrian regiments, he gained invaluable experience of writing for military band and became a very prolific composer of marches. The most famous of these is Entry of the Gladiators completed in 1899 and performed throughout the world, mainly in circuses, ever since. The RSNO are on sparking form here, bringing energy, enthusiasm and precision to Fučík's effervescent Bohemian themes, upbeat brass tunes, and not a few lyrical melodies as well.

John Suchet plays a track from his featured Album of the Week at 10.15am every weekday. You can buy your own copy from the Classic FM store here. Record label: BMG Aled Jones and Russell Watson have joined forces to release their debut duet album In Harmony. The album features a wealth of well-loved hymns, arias, and popular songs. They range from great classical works like Gounod’s Ave Maria, to the toe-tapping song Volare. Sir Karl Jenkins also wrote an original song for the duo, Bright Horizons, that features on the album. Russell said, “What I particularly like is the way that it is not just a collaboration as such where I sing a verse, Aled sings a verse and everybody joins in on the chorus. It’s been really cleverly written and arranged so that our voices blend really well.”  Aled said: “This album has created a real excitement for me – singing songs I don’t normally perform on my own. Recording Volare with Russell was a hoot!” Hallé Concerts Society This is the latest release in the Hallé orchestra’s award-winning Elgar Edition. Sir Mark Elder, music director of the Hallé, conducts the Hallé orchestra in this collection of works by Edward Elgar. The album features lesser-known pieces by the great composer like The Wand of Youth Suites and The Nursery Suite, as well as the popular Salut d’Amour and Chanson de Nuit. This is an album that celebrates youth, nostalgia and Elgar's ability to write great melodies with ease. The Wand of Youth Suites are based on the music written by a teenage Elgar and his siblings and demonstrates the composer's youthful exuberance.  The Nursery Suite also celebrates youth – it was dedicated to Princess Margaret Rose, the Duke and Duchess of York’s second daughter, shortly after her birth in 1930.

John Suchet plays a piece from a new release after 10am every weekday. Decca Classics King of the Waltz and expert showman Andre Rieu sweeps his millions of fans off their feet again with this new album of the greatest love songs ever written.  The tracklisting includes film hits such as My Heart Will Go On from Titanic and Cavatina from The Deer Hunter and timeless classics such as Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen and Scarborough Fair.   The album comes with a DVD which includes two hour-long Andre Rieu concerts. As you'd expect, these are huge spectacles of the kind where 100 horses and a corps of trumpeters and percussionists parade in front of Andre's adoring fans. There's even an appearance from Andre's son Pierre.  Buy from Amazon > Buy from iTunes >  John Brunning plays pieces from a new release after 6pm every weekday. Sony Classical Bill Turnbull - breakfast news host and for the past six months, weekend mornings Classic FM presenter - has personally curated three CDs' worth of the world’s most beautiful and relaxing classical music.

 Buy from Amazon > Buy from iTunes >  Warner Classics The celebrated French trumpeter Maurice Andre loved to claim the lung-power required to play the trumpet like he did was sufficient to inflate a lorry tyre! The fragrant Alison Balsom looks too fragile to blow out the candles on her birthday cake, but in fact gives Maurice a good run for his money in repertoire so beloved of French trumpeters, that for trumpet and organ. There are eight Bach chorales here, where she is partnered by the veteran Stephen Cleobury on the organ of King’s College, Cambridge.  The world-famous King’s Choir join them for a charming performance of Jesu, Joy of Mans Desiring, and Balsom and Cleobury sound especially fine in Sleepers Awake. The rest of this thoroughly enjoyable album is given over to baroque trumpet concertos, or arrangements for trumpet and orchestra. Here Balsom eschews the modern valved trumpet in favour of a baroque valveless instrument. And she sounds really well in music by Torelli, Fasch, and an arrangement for trumpet and orchestra by Stephen Wright of Corelli’s famous Christmas Concerto, itself worth the price of this CD. The Academy of Ancient Music accompany attentively.   Buy from Amazon > Buy from iTunes >  Deutsche Grammophon This is a quite exceptional recital, chosen by the singer, who also contributes an interesting note about why these 14 pieces mean so much to her. DG have obviously not found it easy to crystallise her explanations into a single PR sentence. The best they can manage is to call it: “A personal celebration of the indomitable nature of the feminine spirit.” As for “revive”, well I haven’t a clue. But what I do understand is that on this evidence Garanča is turning into perhaps the exceptional mezzo of her generation. Since I first heard her, as a very young woman, her voice has filled out, taking on a true mezzo timbre, rather than just sounding like a sort of soprano, which so many mezzos do.  So, what she calls the key track on this album, the big aria from Cavalleria Rusticana, sounds much more potent sung by her, with her powerful chest notes, than by most, lighter toned sopranos.  What is also interesting here, reflecting the personal nature of her choices, is the obscurity of some of the arias selected. It’s not every day you hear one from Saint-Saëns’s Henri VIII, or Massenet’s Hérodiade.   She plainly enjoyed the experience, or so she says of working with the Valencia Orchestra under Roberto Abbado, and this album, primarily of Italian and French material, should be sought out by any connoisseur of the voice.  It left me wishing we heard Garanča more often in London. What are you playing at, Covent Garden?  Buy from Amazon > Buy from iTunes >  Sviatoslav Richter (1915-97) was one of the great post-war pianists. Some would say the greatest, though others, myself included, would make a case for his compatriot Emil Gilels, whose centenary it is this year. It was of course Richter’s centenary last year, so this can be seen, maybe, as a bit late. But once again, you don’t need a special reason to play Richter. He is a pianist who always had some light to shed on everything he played, even when, as is sometimes the case here, he is being wilful and eccentric.   Richter’s teacher Heinrich Neuhaus described Richter as surveying the totality of the pieces he played from a great height, like a hawk. It’s certainly true, even when Richter is taking a different view from most of his colleagues, he is always compelling, and always respected the structure of the piece. And of course, his prestidigitation was phenomenal.       So what we have here are powerful pieces by Beethoven and Mozart - the Triple Concerto and Piano Concerto No.22 for instance - and also lighter stuff such as the Grieg Concerto (though it’s not one of the most noteworthy performances on this album), and Dvorak’s neglected Piano Concerto, where he is partnered by none other than Carlos Kleiber.  More rewarding are some of the chamber music performances with the Borodin Quintet - The Trout, Schumann’s Piano Quintet - as well as exhilarating 20th century concertos such as Bartok 2 and Prokofiev 5.  This is best treated as a lucky dip. Sadly not all that much of his best work was done for EMI (now Warner), and he was also undoubtedly one of those musicians who usually gave of his best live, rather than in the clinical conditions of a studio. And, of course, there’s a mass of live recordings by Richter in circulation.   Buy from Amazon >  Decca Voces8 has produced some exceptional albums, and this may be the best of them. Here, the eight voices are joined by a small instrumental ensemble to perform music primarily by northern European composers such as Peteris Vasks and Arvo Pärt. The theme is winter, which means it does include some Christmas material, like Jan Sandström’s arrangement of Praetorius’s Es ist ein Ros Entsprungen, and Holst’s In the Bleak Midwinter, alongside other stuff that has no religious connotations like Vasks’s Plainscape 1-3. Perhaps this is more for the choral connoisseur, rather than the beginner.    Buy from Amazon > Buy from iTunes > ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202530.49/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321172751-20190321194751-00328.warc.gz

'Portraits – The Clarinet Album' is the debut recording from the brilliant young Austrian clarinettist Andreas Ottensamer. He's the first ever solo clarinettist to sing an exclusive agreement with Deutsche Grammophon's legendary Yellow Label - and work as a model at the same time! The repertoire on this album takes us from the early-Romantic intensity of Louis Spohr's first clarinet concerto to the jazz idioms of Aaron Copland's own clarinet concerto. Cimarosa's Oboe Concerto in C - arranged for clarinet by Arthur Benjamin - is also included along with an arrangement of Debussy's popular The Girl with the Flaxen Hair. George Gershwin's Three Preludes, originally composed for piano, and a Berceuse by the American composer Amy Beach, originally a violin piece, complete a beautifully performed programme. The clarinettist has said of this recording: “This album poses the challenge of jumping between different styles and ways of playing, but at the same time I set a high priority on maintaining my personal interpretation and sound.” As in his live performances, Ottensamer's clarinet on this recording is a dark and beautifully warm instrument, played with soulful depth.  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202476.48/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321010720-20190321032720-00345.warc.gz

The pair perform more than 80 concerts annually.  For an album of Baroque moments, expect the usual suspects: Handel, Vivaldi and J.S.Bach are all well represented, often with pieces originally composed for piano and transcribed for guitars. But there’s also a treat at the end in the form of the tender 16th century love song by Hassler, Mein Geist ist mir verwirret, arranged by Bach and featured in both the St. Matthew Passion and the Christmas Oratorio. An album of exuberant, virtuoso playing with a warm, approachable sound, and all at an excellent budget price.  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912206677.94/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326220507-20190327002507-00371.warc.gz

Morning Song was written to celebrate the 21st birthday of the then Princess Elizabeth; Saga Fragment is a reworking of Bax’s own 1922 Piano Quintet. All three were premiered by Bax’s muse and mistress, the pianist Harriet Cohen.The Performance: Morning Song, subtitled ‘Maytime in Sussex’, is the most immediately appealing, a deftly drawn pastoral miniature. Winter Legends (1929-30), lasting nearly 40 minutes, has such a profusion of ideas and gear changes that, for all its colourful orchestral garb and the lively recording, the music holds you at arm’s length. This is the talented Ashley Wass’s eighth Bax disc for Naxos, and he is kept fully occupied throughout all three works.The Verdict: Dramatic and atmospheric though Bax may be, the fragmentary, episodic nature of the main work will take even more than the superb playing of Wass and the Bournemouth players for it to win broad popular appeal.Want More?

Her comic timing is perfect in the hilarious number that gives the opera its title – a parody of schmaltzy musicals – but she conveys all Dinah’s brittle despair in the scenes that focus on the breakdown of her marriage, too. Rodney Gilfry is very good as her self-satisfied husband, but they’re not helped by a background chorus of singers who sound too painfully correct and over-careful in their jazz-style scatting. The same adjectives may also be applied to Ulf Schirmer’s conducting.  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203093.63/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323221914-20190324003914-00229.warc.gz

John Suchet plays a track from his featured Album of the Week at 10.15am every weekday. You can buy your own copy from the Classic FM store here. Deutsche Grammophon World-renowned bass-baritone Sir Bryn Terfel releases his first album in five years – Dreams and Songs – a selection of well-known and traditional pieces. He steps away from the dramatic opera roles that he is revered for in exchange for musical numbers and duets with an impressive guest list. Other artists on the album include Alfie Boe, Katherine Jenkins and Joseph Calleja. There are many light-hearted and uplifting numbers to enjoy on this album, particularly two songs from musical Fiddler on the Roof (including a duet with Emma Thompson), a duet with fellow Welshman Rob Brydon, and Ar Lan y Môr, a traditional Welsh song. He is accompanied by the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Paul Bateman. Evil Penguin Records Roeland Hendrikx, Martyn Brabbins and the London Philharmonic Orchestra pay homage to a genre – the clarinet concerto – in this album. Dedications: Works for Clarinet & Orchestra brings together special recordings of Gerald Finzi's Concerto for Clarinet and String Orchestra, Mozart's Concerto in A Major for Clarinet and Orchestra, and Bruch's Double Concerto for Clarinet and Viola with Orchestra. Hendrikx is joined by violist Sanders Geerts for Bruch's double concerto. Together, the pair explore the romantic and rhapsodic elements of this concerto to close the surprisingly moreish album.

John Suchet plays a track from his featured album at 10:15am every weekday.   John Brunning plays a track from his featured album after 6pm every weekday.  Yannick Nézet-Séguin made his debut with the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 2007 with Dvorak’s vibrant Sixth Symphony, a concert that led to the invitation to become the Orchestra’s Principal Guest conductor in 2008. Returning to the symphony nine years later made for a ‘fearsome’ performance, coupled this time with Dvorak’s powerful and strikingly original overture to Othello. Like Shakespeare’s play, the piece is focussed on the dark side of human love and it completes Dvorak’s trilogy of overtures, ‘Nature, Life & Love’. This live recording of the Seventh Symphony comes from Nézet-Séguin’s first year with the Orchestra; it might not be Dvorak’s most popular symphony, but it’s arguably his best.   BIS  It’s difficult to make an impact in these much recorded concertos, but Sudbin manages to do so, with playing of terrific verve, very well partnered by the small (41 player) Tapiola Sinfonietta under Osmo Vänskä. These performances have such freshness, I find them entirely captivating.   Especially No 1, where the opening allegro is indeed “con brio” as the composer marked it.  My pleasure in this concerto is further enhanced by a wonderfully light and athletic finale, and two cadenzas composed by Sudbin himself. Some years ago the Daily Telegraph hailed Sudbin as “potentially one of the greatest pianists of the 21st century”.  If that seems an exaggeration before you listen to this album, it won’t once you have finished it.  A sure fire winner. You can purchase the album here. Winged Lion (2CDs)   This is the fourth album of major choral music set down by Paul McCreesh in Poland, where he winningly combines the talents of his own Gabrieli Consort and Players, with the Wroclaw Baroque Orchestra, and the National Forum of Music Choir. This makes for a very large chorus indeed, which McCreesh, an impeccable musicologist who has reworked the English libretto for this recording, justifies by pointing out the size of the choir that Haydn himself employed in this work in an early performance. With three talented, if not perhaps outstanding, British soloists, this recording is well worth acquiring, to get to know one of Haydn’s most treasurable works. In his introductory note, McCreesh says people sometimes blame Haydn for not being Mozart, and the Seasons for not being the Creation.  A clever point.  I’m sure Mozart also thought that Haydn was very much his equal.  I also love the Creation, but believe the Seasons, composed in 1801 as one of Haydn’s final masterpieces, is every bit as good. These Winged Lion issues come in a book, with over 100 pages, including engaging photographs from the recording sessions, and the complete Libretto printed on very good quality paper, as well as some insightful analysis.    Chandos  Imogen Cooper is making the most of her new recording contract with Chandos, by moving out beyond Schubert, and other classical composers, with which she made her reputation.   This generous 75 minute recital is carefully chosen, and draws on Liszt’s output from over 40 years. There’s a tremendous range of music here, from his own transcription of Gretchen from the Faust Symphony, which lasts almost 20 minutes, to little snatches of almost a tonal and revolutionary late Liszt from the 1880s like Nuages Gris, and the so called Bagatelle Without Tonality. These make a pleasing contrast with four pieces from Liszt’s Italian Pilgrimage, published in 1842. For good measure she also includes Liszt’s transcription of his son-in-law Richard Wagner’s Isolde Liebestod, Wagner’s own short Elegy for piano, drawing on themes from Tristan, and a transcription of the Overture by the late lamented Hungarian virtuoso Zoltan Kocsis, who died last year. Cooper is extremely musical throughout, and this recording will bring great pleasure.  It’s idle to pretend, though, that she has the temperament and power of the greatest Liszt interpreters, like Jorge Bolet, Alfred Brendel, or indeed Kocsis himself.   Thoroughly enjoyable nevertheless.   Warner Classics (7CDs)  Angela Gheorghiu has recently celebrated her 25th anniversary at Covent Garden with a run of Cilea’s Adriana Lecouvreur, a favourite of hers, and two arias from it appear in this collection. I attended her Covent Garden debut - Traviata – where, with the ardent advocacy of Sir Georg Solti - it seemed as if a star was born. And, as these albums attest – and of course there’s several complete opera recordings from her, especially of Puccini, worthy of your attention - she has gone on to have a good career, though perhaps not the great one that might have been anticipated.  Her voice has always been a pretty remarkable instrument and remains so, but her temperament and work ethic has often seemed to let her down.  She has not produced the body of work that, let us say, great sopranos like Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland did in the recording studio.  It’s interesting to note that of these seven CDs, only one has been recorded in the last decade.  I’m sure her record company would have liked more, but Gheorghiu didn’t want to produce more.  As it is, there is much to enjoy here.  Two duet albums with her then husband Roberto Alagna from the late 90s.  An album of bel canto favourites from Covent Garden in 2001.  A live recital from Covent Garden that same year (also released separately) which I did not enjoy at the time, but which doesn’t sound too bad on disc.   Then there’s a Puccini album from 2004, marred by the uber-slow conducting of the elderly Anton Coppola; another live recital with piano accompaniment, this time from La Scala in 2006; and the only product of a barren last decade, a supposed Homage to Callas from 2011. You can purchase the album here. Onyx  James Ehnes is extremely good at self-documentation, via the artist led label Onyx.  This pair of Beethoven’s finest Violin Sonatas makes for pleasurable listening, especially when technically the recording, from Monmouth late 2015/early 2016, is so vivid. Ehnes’s full blooded tone is vividly captured by the microphones, and his musical judgement is consistently impeccable.  His regular partner, Andrew Armstrong, also makes a strong impression, in an album that can be thoroughly recommended to those who, on a single CD, would like to sample what Beethoven’s Violin Sonatas are all about.

This celebratory album winningly combines the familiar and the unfamiliar, and offers a snapshot of classical music between 1868 and 1878, when these three pieces were premiered. Obviously the Bruch Concerto is incredibly well known, but it comes up fresh as paint here, with a particularly effective, fleet footed finale. Edouard Lalo’s Symphonie Espagnole is shamefully neglected. Its five movements are beautifully laid out for violin and orchestra, and each one contains a memorable melody. It was premiered in 1874 by the Spanish virtuoso Pablo de Sarasate, so it was a charming idea to complete this exceptional album with Sarasate’s Zigeunerweisen, a memorable ramble through Hungarian gypsy themes. Capuçon plays well throughout, and the Orchestre de Paris accompany attentively under Paavo Jarvi. In today’s programme from 7pm, I will be playing the first and third movements of the Bruch, and Zigeunerweisen - a feast for violin lovers.  Ben Johnson / Opus Arte Ben Johnson won the Audience Prize at the 2013 Cardiff Singer of the World Competition. He is a splendid young tenor of great musicality, and a genuinely Italianate timbre. But here he turns his attention to British ballads, primarily from Victorian and Edwardian times. These neglected songs are full of charm and melodic distinction, and beautifully performed on this Opus Arte album, as you will hear if you tune into my show at 7pm tonight. I will be playing four of them. The title song “I heard You Singing” is a touching piece with a great tune, from that master of light music, Eric Coates. Elgar’s Pleading shows what a formidable songwriter he could have been if he had chosen better poetry to set. My especial favourite is Amy Woodforde-Finden’s Kashmiri Song, also possessed of a lovely melody. Sullivan’s The Lost Chord is a treasurable piece of Victorian mawkishness, that still makes an emotional impact when as persuasively performed as here. The Sixteen / Coro The Sixteen, the voices of Classic FM, have never made a bad record, and this is an excellent one. Cleverly, this album brings together the music of the 16th-century polyphonist William Byrd, one of the greatest European masters of his age, and three choral pieces by the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt, who celebrated his 80th birthday last year. In his notes The Sixteen’s founder and conductor Harry Christophers said Byrd and Pärt “make for a perfect match”, and so they do, without Pärt's music, written 400 years later, sounding reactionary or old hat. The album is named after one of Pärt’s pieces, The Deer’s Cry (2007), words by St Patrick, which has great dignity. I will be playing that, and one of the Byrd pieces, on my Sunday show in a fortnight’s time.  Angela Hewitt / Hyperion Angela Hewitt has made some outstanding Bach recitals on the grand piano for Hyperion, but in recent times has mainly moved on to the late 18th and 19th century masters like Mozart and Liszt. I had few reservations about her Bach playing, but haven’t liked everything else, including last year’s Liszt album, which I though almost unbearably slow. Others, however, disagreed. But with this Domenico Scarlatti CD she’s back in the world of the baroque, which is where I think she’s most persuasive. It’s a typically generous Hyperion offering, lasting 76 minutes, and featuring 16 sonatas out of the 555 (yes, really!) Scarlatti wrote.  Amadeus Guitar Duo / Naxos Dale Kavanagh and Thomas Kirchhoff, both teachers at the Detmold Academy of Music, have been playing together as the Amadeus Guitar Duo for 25 years. This album of mainly Spanish music was recorded in 2007, but only one of the 21 tracks here has appeared previously. That curious history shouldn’t put any guitar fan off, because this is an extremely well executed, and thoroughly entertaining and unhackneyed hour-long recital, where established masters like Rodrigo and Tárrega rub shoulders with contemporary composers like Alfonso Montes (B 1955). Montes’s five movement Surama is a collection of dance tunes, dedicated to this duo, including a Cha Cha, and with an especially engaging tune in the fourth Canto movement. Thoroughly recommended.

110,classicfm.com/discover-music/,classical,https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/album-reviews/chamber-orchestra-london-over-hill-over-dale/," This beautiful collection of English string music features some real discoveries. Classic FM Drive Featured Album, 8 July 2013. The Chamber Ensemble of London is developing quite a reputation for discovering and championing little-known or lost repertoire for string orchestras. Their latest album ranges across the centuries - from Purcell to the present day - to uncover exquisite lost works, including some by towering figures of English music. Harold Darke's Fantasy in E major for String Orchestra gets a memorable world premiere recording, as does Giles Farnaby's Seven Pieces for String Orchestra. Elgar's tender Elegy for Strings was likely written by the composer on hearing of the death of his great champion, August Jaeger who he had already immortalised as 'Nimrod' in the Enigma Variations. Sir Malcolm Arnold's Concert for Two Violins and String Orchestra features the Ensemble's director Peter Fisher and Maya Iwabuchi.  A beautifully recorded and performed album with something new for all listeners.

111,classicfm.com/discover-music/,classical,https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/album-reviews/chapman-campbell/," Atmospheric piano pieces from an emerging composing talent.  The young Guernsey-born pianist and composer Alexander Chapman Campbell is just emerging from hours of solitary composing to make his music more widely available. His album, titled Sketches of Light, consists of 12 piano pieces which depict light at different times of day, in different settings and encompassing varying atmospheric conditions. Comparisons to other composers who produce hypnotic, repetitive - but infinitely tuneful - piano music are inevitable, but Chapman Campbell's pieces have a haunting quality and emotional resonance that deserve repeated listening.

112,classicfm.com/discover-music/,classical,https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/album-reviews/charles-mackerras-epic-mozart-box-set/," Mozart's symphonies are under tight control from Charles Mackerras and the Prague CO. Composer: Mozart  Repertoire: Symphonies Nos 1-41Artists: Prague CO/MackerrasRating: 5/5 Genre: Instrumental Label: Telarc CD-80300 (10 CDs) This stunning boxed set, recorded 1986-91, collects together all of Mozart’s authenticated symphonies. Charles Mackerras and his legendary band of Czech players sound intoxicated by the last six great symphonies, yet, if anything the early works make an even stronger impression, with Mozart’s boyhood invention bubbling with an effervescence to leave one giddy and light-headed. As each work closes you simply can’t wait to hear what will happen next. A treasure-trove of musical delights.

113,classicfm.com/discover-music/,classical,https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/album-reviews/charlie-siem-comes-age/," Charlie Siem fearlessly tackles some of the great 19th century violin works by the likes of Bazzini and Kreisler  Composer: VariousRepertoire: Music by Wieniawski, Kreisler, Bazzini, Paganini, et al.Artists: Charlie Siem (vln), Caroline Jaya–Ratnam (pf)Rating:  3/5Genre: ChamberLabel: Warner Classics 2564 67804-7 The Music: The 19th century was the golden age of the violin virtuoso; the likes of Paganini, Bazzini and Sarasate ruled with a series of self-penned showstoppers which form the core of this recital.  The Performances: Charlie Siem started playing aged three, and he makes some of the most ferocious pieces in the repertoire sound almost childishly simple. His facility in Wieniawski’s whistle-stop Caprice and Bazzini’s ricochet-laden La ronde des lutins is jaw-dropping, and even Franz Waxman’s notorious Carmen Fantasy would seems to hold no terrors for him. The only thing missing is a risk-taking, dangerous quality that would really have us on the edge of our seats. The Verdict: Siem may not yet quite reach the giddy heights of Perlman and Heifetz, but there is no doubting his style and ease of technique.      ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202324.5/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320085116-20190320111116-00204.warc.gz
114,classicfm.com/discover-music/,classical,https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/album-reviews/chopin-pollini/," Throughout the week Classic FM’s presenters bring you the best new recordings, including world exclusives and premiere broadcasts of latest releases.  John Suchet plays a track from his featured album at 10:15am every weekday. LPO  John Brunning plays a track from his featured album after 6pm every weekday. Deutsche Grammophon  On 5th January 2017, the Italian Maestro Maurizio Pollini commemorated his 75th birthday, and what better time to look back on a world career that has made him one of the most admired artist personalities of the present and begin the year of jubilee with exquisite works by Frédéric Chopin. One of the highlights of the album is the gently flowing Barcarolle, as well as the six Mazurkas and three Waltzes, a first time recording for Pollini. In addition to the lyrical pieces, the album features the Mazurka in F sharp minor and the increasingly delirious Polonaise-Fantasy in A flat major and draws to a close with the two more intimate Nocturnes.   Chandos  The flute is everyone’s favourite, isn’t it, invariably burbling away like a garrulous friend. Given that, it’s surprising how little known Mozart’s flute music is.  The Concerto for Flute and Harp is popular, but his two Flute Concertos aren’t really.  Nor are the delicious Quartets for flute and string trio recorded here by the delightful Lisa Friend, as bubbly as her instrument, and three members of the Brodsky Quartet. This is happy music that makes few demands, and will bring a smile to your face.  And it’s hard to imagine them better done than they are here in excellent sound.  Onyx (2CDs)  The Canadian James Ehnes is one of the finest violinists of today, and he has just issued on the artist-led label Onyx, a 2CD set lasting 145 minutes, featuring the five Violin Concertos Mozart wrote in his teens, with two rondos and an adagio included as a substantial, 20 minute, makeweight. These recordings were set down in Canada in 2005, but have never before been issued here.  The sound is good, and the playing of Ehnes and his band better than good. My only regret is that Mozart’s masterpiece for violin and orchestra, the Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola wasn’t included.  LSO Live  John Eliot Gardiner is best known, of course, for his work with original instrument bands, but he also has an excellent track record as a conductor of full symphony orchestras.  He adds to that reputation here with an excellent account of the complete incidental music to A Midsummer Night’s Dream recorded at the Barbican last February. The Overture is an astonishing piece of work for a boy in his mid-teens.  Invited by the Kaiser almost two decades later to write some complete incidental music, Mendelssohn complied with some delightful stuff, including a delicious Nocturne, and the ever popular Wedding March. I suppose it’s a bit of a back handed compliment to suggest, that all this music sounds as if it was written at the same time.  Because there is an implied suggestion that Mendelssohn did not develop as much as he should have done, from the young genius who in his teens, wrote better music than Mozart.  But that is actually the truth of it.

115,classicfm.com/discover-music/,classical,https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/album-reviews/christmas-in-harvard-square/," A lovely festive choral release from the Boys of St. Paul’s Choir School, directed by their British choirmaster. Classic FM Drive Featured Album, 1 December 2014. Cambridge choirmaster John Robinson crossed the pond to another Cambridge (in Massachusetts) to lead America's only Roman Catholic Boys choir school - The Boys Of St. Paul’s Choir School. This is a group with a rich history. Previous line-ups have performed with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Leonard Bernstein, on the stage of Carnegie Hall, in St. Peter’s Square at the Vatican for Pope Francis, and at countless Boston Red Sox and Celtics games.  In this, their first international recording, the Choir offers an attractive selection of favourite carols, presented in traditional as well as appealing modern arrangements by Robinson himself. This is no ordinary choir - they sing with a purity and commitment which is missing on other recordings.   ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202324.5/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320085116-20190320111116-00148.warc.gz
116,classicfm.com/discover-music/,classical,https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/album-reviews/crown-imperial-coronation/," A rousing collection of concert band pieces, some of which have never been recorded before. Classic FM Drive Featured Album, 7 July 2014. Three British Kings and one Queen were crowned during the 20th century and this selection of eleven marches highlights the fine ceremonial music that was written for their coronations. There are, of course, familiar pieces from Elgar and Walton as well as less well-known offerings from Arnold Bax, Arthur Bliss and even Frenchman Saint-Saens and the American John Philip Sousa, who both captured the spirit of Edward VII's coronation with marches of their own. Some of these works have never been recorded by a concert band before and it's fascinating to hear them in the form in which the public would have first encountered them. The newly formed London Symphonic Concert Band who play them are all experienced players from British orchestras. They clearly relish the opportunity to perform and record repertoire that deserves to be heard afresh.

117,classicfm.com/discover-music/,classical,https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/album-reviews/dallapiccola-works-made-accessible/," Despite Luigi Dallapiccola’s reputation as an exacting 12-tone composer, there’s nothing to be frightened of here.

The song cycle Quattro Liriche (1964), too, is compelling. His Dialoghi (1960) and Three Questions with Two Answers (1963) are tougher nuts, but their graceful lyricism is powerfully captured by Noseda’s immaculately shaped phrases.       ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202628.42/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322034516-20190322060516-00300.warc.gz

Album of the Week, 18 February 2013. Featuring music by Nyman, Pärt, Glass, Richter, and Einaudi, the album serves as a kind of modern minimalist taster menu, showcasing a variety of different pieces by contemporary composers, sandwiched between a few choice favourites from the classical canon. A particular highlight is a new arrangement of Einaudi's I Giorni for solo violin, piano and strings. Played by the composer himself, the delicate piano melody is brought to life by a chorus of shimmering strings and the sweet sound of Hope's solo playing.But it's not all soaring violins and heart-breaking tunes. The title track, Spheres, composed by Gabriel Prokofiev with its angular melodies and clashing harmonies is something altogether different - but Hope's trademark violin sound is still distinct within the cosmic textures, inspired by the sounds planets make when they move.

Howard Shelley and the Ulster Orchestra return for a second volume in Hyperion's new Classical Piano Concerto series. Daniel Steibelt, now almost completely forgotten, was best known in his day for daring to challenge Beethoven to a piano duel – and being humiliated. DISCOVER: Introducing the man who challenged Beethoven to a musical duel - Daniel Steibelt > Steibelt though was one of the most brilliant keyboardists of northern Europe for some 25 years. His own concertos were sensationally popular. But his longevity was not helped by his personality: contemporary reports say Steibelt was vain, arrogant and ostentatiously extravagant. His most celebrated work – the Piano Concerto No 3 in E major, revived on this excellent recording by Howard Shelley and the Ulster Orchestra, was immensely popular because of its ‘storm’ finale. Steibelt is no Beethoven or Mozart; he didn't have the ability to develop themes and stayed away from playing slow, sustained music. But, because he was a natural showman, the emphasis here is on dazzling fingerwork and glittering virtuosity. Shelley brings Steibelt's music back to life with all the panache we have come to expect from the many other piano concertos he has recorded for Hyperion in their previous Romantic piano concerto series.

Born in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, his technical brilliance and artistry has already Trifonov a host of awards. In the summer of 2011, he took the 13th Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Master Competition in Tel-Aviv before returning to Russia to win first prize, the Gold Medal, and Grand Prix at the XIV International Tchaikovsky Competition. He also scooped the Audience Award and the Award for the best performance of a Mozart concerto. This February, one day after signing his record deal with Deutsche Grammophone, Trifoniv was on stage for his debut Carnegie Hall recital in New York. And DG was there to record him. On this album of that concert, he plays Liszt's Piano Sonata in B minor, Scriabin's Piano Sonata No. 2, Chopin's 24 Préludes and the second of Medtner's Four Fairy Tales. And it's everything you would expect: dramatic and thrilling, soulful and artistic - true virtuosic playing from a name to look out for.

John Suchet plays a track from his featured Album of the Week at 10.15am every weekday. You can buy your own copy from the Classic FM store here. Erato David Fray presents a collaborative album of Bach concertos for two, three and four pianos. He performs with Audrey Vigoureux, Emmanuel Christien and Jacques Rouvier in what he calls ""a musical family affair"". Fray, along with Vigoureux and Christien, has studied under Rouvier, and all four players feature on the album. The four pianists were joined by the Orchestre national du Capitole de Toulouse to record the Bach concertos in Toulouse's 18th-century Carmelite Chapel. The authentic recording is, both in acoustics and execution, a refreshing compilation of Bach's plentiful piano works.

CRITIC'S CHOICEAlfred Brendel: Complete Philips RecordingsDecca 4788827 Alfred Brendel was 85 last Tuesday, and to celebrate, Decca have brought out this amazing bumper box of all the recordings he made for their now defunct sister label Philips between 1970 and 2008, when he retired. Brendel is amusingly downbeat about his talents; “I am not a child prodigy, I’m not Jewish, or from Eastern Europe, my parents were not musicians.  I’m not a good sight reader, so I’m completely at a loss to explain why I made it”. But these recordings are the work of a master pianist who kept on developing, so there’s something new in all three of the complete Beethoven Piano Concerto sets he recorded between the mid-seventies and the mid-nineties, which is also true of his two complete Beethoven Piano Sonata cycles recorded two decades apart.  Costa Pilavachi, former President of Philips Classics, who made most of these recordings, sums up Brendel’s recorded legacy thus; “His discography ranges from Bach to the great classics of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert, all the way to Berg and Schoenberg, and includes magisterial performances of Schumann, Brahms, Liszt, Mussorgsky and Busoni.  Alfred is an artist who is completely sure of his strengths and tastes and never recorded anything in which he did not have absolute belief”. At £175 or less, this may seem a lot, but it isn’t really for over 100 CDs of such quality. In my show this week I will be playing some Mozart, the final movement of the Emperor, a bit of the Trout Quintet, and some Liszt, to prove Brendel really is one of the greatest. Buy from Amazon >  BEST BARGAIN Pablo de Sarasate – Complete Music for Violin and Orchestra Tianwa Yang/Orquesta Sinfónica de Navarra/Ernest Martínez IzquierdoNaxos 8504046 This 4CD set, also available separately, was recorded between 2009 and 2013, and has recently won the German Record Critics Prize. Sarasate (1844-1908) was one of the greatest violinists of his generation, and gave many important premieres, including Bruch’s Scottish Fantasy. Tianwa Yang accompanied by the Orchestra of Navarre, plays most beautifully a lot of attractive pieces, including Zigeunerweisen and the Carmen Fantasy, that are still played by lots of violinists today.Buy from Amazon >   OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS Hélène Grimaud: WaterDeutsche Grammophon 00028947934264 Hélène Grimaud has a formidable technique, and there is much to enjoy in Water. She plays standard watery stuff such as Liszt's Jeux d'Eau à La Villa D'Este and Debussy's La Cathédrale Engloutie with panache.  And the piano sound is exceptional. So far, so good. Where it all goes Pete Tong is her saddling herself with a concept that involves a lot of New Age nonsense about Water, and a set of so called Transitions between each piece, composed and played by the electronic composer Nitin Sawhney. This stuff sounds like a cross between the score of a student horror film, and the kind of background noise you hear when Tim Peake speaks to us from outer space.  A complete waste of time, which detracts from, but doesn’t totally overwhelm, some excellent playing here. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >   Nielsen: The Complete Symphonies 1-6 Frankfurt Radio Symphony/Paavo JärviRCA 88875178802 Nielsen’s 150th last year passed relatively unnoticed compared to Sibelius’s 150th, but Nielsen was a genuine symphonist of real stature, who, like Sibelius, met the symphonic challenge differently in each of his six symphonies. These recordings derive from Hess Radio recordings from 2009-2013, and are very sympathetically played and recorded under Paavo Jävi, one of today’s fastest rising conductors, despite being a dead ringer for Putin. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >   Amy Dickson: Island SongsSydney Symphony OrchestraSony 88875169062The Australian saxophonist Amy Dickson is a fine player, and a really nice person, whose albums I always like to hear, and review. She’s made a number of delightful easy listening CDs for Sony, but this isn’t one of them.  This is the other side of Amy, the cutting edge musician, who wants to commission challenging contemporary music for her instrument, especially, as here, from Australian composers. Inevitably, this is a mixed bag. The late Peter Sculthorpe’s Island Songs is a joy throughout, as are parts of Ross Edwards’ Full-Moon Dances, especially the Water-Moon and Sanctus movements.  But Brett Dean’s Siduri Dances is just noise that I’d never want to listen to again.

CRITIC'S CHOICE Ennio Morricone: The Hateful Eight, Original SoundtrackDecca 4769489 Forty years on from the classic Clint Eastwood Spaghetti Westerns, Morricone rides the range again with this hotly debated Quentin Tarantino spectacular that went on general release last week. And Morricone, at 87, dishes up a meaty plateful of spag bol here, with a score that’s edgy, noisy, and memorable in a surprisingly repetitive, minimalist, Michael Nymanesque way. It’s loud, and often brash, but I guess Tarantino insisted on that.  But it’s also cleverly orchestrated, as befits a composer who has scored 450 movies since his first one, more than half a century ago. I love Morricone.  My favourite of all film scores is Once Upon A Time In America, because of the tender, long breathed melodies, beautifully scored, including a popular twenties waltz tune, Amapola, so cleverly integrated into Sergio Leone’s final movie. The Hateful Eight's music won’t move you, but you will find it exciting. This has surely got to be an Oscar winning score even if it’s Morricone at less than his best, because he should have got an Oscar for Once Upon A Time in America, but the producers failed to enter it!  Time for the Academy to make amends, methinks. Download from iTunesBuy from Amazon  OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS Schumann: Music for Piano and OrchestraJan Lisiecki/Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia/Antonio PappanoDeutsche Grammophon DG 4795327 Twenty-year old Jan Lisiecki is an outstanding pianist, already making his third album for Deutsche Grammophon.  This one is admirably straight forward. It's all the music Schumann wrote for piano and orchestra, and it works because, although the Piano Concerto is a staple of almost every concert pianist's repertoire, neither the Introduction and Allegro Appassionato nor the Introduction and Concert-Allegro are well known. Lisiecki says it's their length – less than 15 minutes each – that means they rarely get heard in the concert hall. ""They are also difficult- you work very hard, mastering all their complex and intricate details, and then rarely get a chance to perform them afterwards,"" he says.  Indeed, in 117 years of making recordings, DG has never recorded them before. But, for home listening, short duration is more of a virtue than a problem, and I have loved both these pieces for many years, while always admiring the Piano Concerto for its perennial freshness. I'll be playing the Introduction And Concert-Allegro complete on my programme at 7pm Sunday evening. Download from iTunesBuy from Amazon  Saint-Saëns: Cello ConcertoTruls Mørk/Louis Lortie/Hélène Mercier/Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra/Neeme JärviChandos - CHSA5162 This typically generous, 76-minute, Chandos album is almost two for the price of one:  You get both of Saint-Saëns's thoroughly engaging cello concertos from veteran Norwegian cellist Truls Mørk, of whom we hear too little these days, and then the pianists take over.  Louis Lortie dispatches the Wedding Cake Caprice, and single-movement Africa, with his usual aplomb, and is then is joined by regular partner Hélène Mercier in a dazzling account of The Carnival Of The Animals. Saint-Saëns thought it beneath him and refused to have it published in his lifetime; now it's his most popular work! The Bergen Philharmonic yet again puts on a five-star show under the hugely experienced Neeme Järvi. Not to be missed by anyone who likes lively romantic music with big tunes. I'll be playing the opening section of the Cello Concerto No1 on my show at 7pm Sunday eveningBuy from Amazon   Milos: Blackbird - The Beatles AlbumMercury Classics 4812310 A surprising success this, with nothing sounding cheap or hackneyed.  The standout track here is Takemitsu’s well known transcription for solo guitar of Yesterday. But the other 14 arrangements are worthwhile too, often involving a small instrumental ensemble, and drawing on the talents of the cellist Steven Isserlis in Michelle, and the sitar player Anoushka Shankar in Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.  Somewhat to my surprise I also enjoyed Tori Amos’s vocals in She’s Leaving Home.  Amos actually makes this sad little tale of family breakdown more poignant than the Fab Four did originally.

Probably not, but they make for cheerful listening here, with some fine playing from bassoonist Patrick de Ritis, and the Würzburg Philharmonic, taken from a live concert in December 2014. Paganini probably did compose the Concertino for horn and bassoon, and that too rambles along enjoyably here, with some engaging horn playing from José Vicente Castelló. Stir in Malcolm Sargent’s orchestral suite from Respighi’s Rossini cook-up La Boutique Fantasque, and Puccini’s early and really charming Preludio Sinfonico, and you’ve got 75 minutes of really well-played, easy listening.Buy from Amazon  David Mellor is Opera and Classical Critic of the Mail on Sunday and presenter of his own show on Classic FM, Sundays 7pm.

125,classicfm.com/discover-music/,classical,https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/album-reviews/david-mellor-31-january/," The Russian Virtuosi of Europe CD Launch. 02:01 Every week our albums guru David Mellor reviews the best of the new releases and reissues, and features two of them in his Sunday show at 7pm.   CRITIC'S CHOICE Tchaikovsky: Serenade for Strings/Souvenir de FlorenceRussian Virtuosi of EuropeOrchid Classics The clumsily named Russian Virtuosi of Europe are a first class ensemble who play really well in the manner of those similarly excellent early recordings of string repertoire by the Academy of St Martin in the Fields. In these London made recordings, because most of the musicians are based here, the violinist Yuri Zhislin directs the ensemble from the leader’s desk, just as Neville Marriner used to do in those early days. And the instrumental forces – five first violins, five second violins, four violas, four cellos and one double bass, – plus the exceptional skills of the players, also recalls the past glories of the Academy in music of course that they themselves played: two of Tchaikovsky’s finest string pieces, the Serenade for Strings, and the orchestral version of the sextet Souvenir de Florence. Souvenir definitely works better as a sextet, but the string version is better than nothing, and full of good tunes, and with an especially eloquent slow movement.  The Serenade is very well done, and you can hear the Waltz on my programme at 7pm on Sunday 31 January. Pre-order from Amazon >  BEST OF THE REST The Best of Plácido DomingoSony 88875123122 Plácido Domingo celebrated his 75th birthday last week, or so he says.  Others believe him to be older, a suggestion the great tenor resents. Well, it doesn’t matter to me how old he is, what matters is his hugely distinguished career, a fair sampling of which in all aspects, generally excellent, but sometimes rather tasteless, appear in this generously filled five-hour, four-album set from Sony. The first two are devoted to operatic stuff, about which there can be no quibbles. But the third features Domingo doing popular songs, where he can be – to put it as kindly as I can – way too glutinous, for my taste at least. But not of course in everything, so don’t let that put you off, especially since the Spanish and South American stuff on the fourth album is very attractive. Buy from Amazon >Download from iTunes >  Rachmaninov: Symphony No.3/10 SongsLondon Philharmonic Orchestra/Vladimir JurowskiLPO LPO0088 Rachmaninov’s Third Symphony, composed in the mid-1930s, was a flop first time around, and has never captured the public’s imagination the way the once neglected, but now greatly treasured, Second has done. But Jurowski makes a strong case for it here, with tempi that allow the romantic tunes to emerge most persuasively, even though some will prefer a little more tension, especially in the first movement.  It’s at mid-price, and well played here in a recording from a live concert last April. It’s well worth acquiring by those who feel the need to move on into more Rachmaninov than the Second Piano Concerto and the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini. The filler is a real connoisseur’s choice: Jurowski’s grandfather, also called Vladimir, was asked in the 1940s to orchestrate 10 Rachmaninov songs chosen by the outstanding Soviet tenor of the day, Ivan Kozlovsky. Jurowski laboured long and hard over this task, and what emerges is a really compelling listen, with the tenor Vsevolod Grivnov performing these songs most persuasively. This is more than young Jurowski paying homage to a close relative; this is very worthwhile music indeed. Buy from Amazon > Jessica Pratt: SerenadeJessica Pratt/Vincenzo ScaleraOpus Arte OACD9038D The Australian coloratura soprano Jessica Pratt has an extremely well-schooled and secure technique, and this excellent, wide ranging recital, makes good listening throughout. It derives from one of the many concerts that have been put on down the years by the warm-hearted London lawyer and connoisseur of the voice, Ian Rosenblatt. For me, this album would be worth acquiring just for one favourite item – the Belgian composer Eva Dell’Acqua’s charming and stylish Villanelle. I shall be playing it on my programme on Sunday 31 January at 7pm. Download from iTunes >Buy from iTunes >  BEST BARGAIN Schubert: The Edition 1Various ArtistsDeutsche Grammophon 0028947955450 This superb box is a snip at around £60 for 39 albums, including as it does generally excellent performances of the best of Schubert’s orchestral, chamber, and solo piano music. The symphonies and the delicious Rosamunde incidental music are first class recordings from Claudio Abbado and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, that have been best in class for almost 30 years. The chamber music features Emil Gilels and the Amadeus Quartet in the 'Trout' Quintet – there isn’t a better version to be had; Rostropovich as second cellist with the Melos Quartet in the profoundly moving Quintet, one of the greatest pieces of chamber music ever written; and a fine ensemble led by the violinist and conductor Gidon Kremer in the Octet. Eighteen piano sonatas are played by Wilhelm Kempff, one of the master pianists of the twentieth century, while other stuff, like the Impromptus and the Moments Musicaux are well played by the Portuguese classicist Maria Joao Pires. This is an unmissable set packed with classic performances that have stood the test of time.

     Every week our presenter David Mellor reviews the best of the new releases and re-issues from the classical world SongplayJoyce DiDonatoErato “Some of the most joyous music making of my life”, that's what the redoubtable Joyce DiDonato says about this exhilarating album, which manages to combine Baroque songs with modern jazz. Her collaboration with the Craig Terry Trio, the virtuoso trumpeter Charlie Porter, and, on three tracks, the bandoneon player Lautaro Greco, recorded in California last March, manages the almost impossible; it brings crossover into repute. Here, she and her colleagues take Italian baroque songs and arias used by budding opera singers to burnish their technique – stuff like 'Caro Mio Ben' with its totally memorable tune – and offer often mind-blowing performances that, I wager, would bring even the most discerning jazz club audience to their feet. Then she and Terry mix it up a bit, with some more modern stuff, like the Battersea-born blind jazz pianist (a musical hero of mine) George Shearing’s 'Lullaby of Birdland'; Duke Ellington’s 'Solitude'; and, for me, best of all, Rodgers and Hart’s 'With a Song in My Heart', that swept the country back in 1930. This album deserves to be heard by anyone who admires exceptional singing and instrumental craftsmanship, whether in opera, jazz, or popular music. Buy from Amazon > Henryk SzeryngComplete Philips Mercury and DG recordings (44 CDs)Decca Henryk Szeryng died 30 years ago at the relatively early age of 70. Polish by birth, and Mexican by adoption, he travelled the world, winning golden opinions everywhere, including in London, where I saw him often in the 70s, and greatly admired his technique. He was not just a virtuoso, but a musician of real depth and sophistication, which accounts for the fact, as is obvious from the recordings here, that he was an outstanding Bach player, who could also make two of the finest ever recordings (included here) of the Brahms Concerto. Szeryng also loved chamber music.  So you also have all the Beethoven Violin Sonatas and Trios; some delightful Handel; plus all the Mozart Sonatas, as well as all the Mozart Concertos, including a spurious one, no longer thought to be by the master. Szeryng’s elegance and mastery of a variety of styles, is to be found everywhere in this well recorded box, which any lover of the violin should buy and cherish at what is, at under £90 for 44 CDs, a remarkable bargain.  Buy from Amazon > New Year’s Concert 2019Christian Thielemann & Vienna PhilharmonicSony Though this concert is in the main a sober affair, few pieces have that particular Viennese lilt and lift that can make Strauss family concerts so magical. This album is not to be discarded lightly. The bigger the piece, the more Thielemann gets out of it, and the performances here of ‘The Artists’ Life’ (J Strauss II) and ‘Music of the Spheres’ (Josef Strauss) are undeniably persuasive. And there’s a lot of rarities, with six of the 17 pieces performed receiving their first-ever outing at a New Year’s Day concert. Of the newcomers, Josef Strauss’s polka ‘The Ballerina’, and Johann Strauss II’s ‘Eva Waltz’, with its Wagnerian opening, are actually rather good. Yet I don’t see Thielemann being asked back too often. After all, Karajan himself only conducted this concert once, in 1987. Strauss family connoisseurs will surely want this album.

     Every week our presenter David Mellor reviews the best of the new releases and re-issues from the classical world. ChopinMaurizio PolliniDeutsche Grammophon Maurizio Pollini sprang to fame aged 18 at the 1960 International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw where one of the judges, Arthur Rubinstein, proclaimed him “technically better than any of us”. Almost 60 years later, his Chopin still sounds wonderfully well in this album devoted to music composed in 1843-44 – towards the end of Chopin’s short life. Pollini is a great pianist, whose principal gifts are his virtuosity allied to intellectual rigour, not the sentimentality of the moment. He knows what he thinks of this music – the third sonata, the berceuse, two nocturnes and three mazurkas – and delivers it almost exactly as he has done throughout his career. The stopwatch tells us his third sonata is within 20 seconds of the duration of his 1984 recording, and the Berceuse, at 4:29, exactly the same as in 1991. The quality of his prestidigitation shows no signs of old age. His insights are those of a formidable master, which he has been throughout his long career. For Pollini, Chopin is a serious grown-up, and I like him best that way, which is why, for me, Pollini is my favourite living interpreter of Chopin’s music. Buy from Amazon > John FieldPiano Music (6 CDs)Naxos The Irish virtuoso and composer John Field (1782-1837) travelled widely in Poland and Russia, knew Chopin, and once described him as “a sickroom talent.” But Chopin has lasted, whereas Field mainly hasn’t. It’s a shame, because the Irishman was obviously a formidable player, and his compositions reward attention – especially the Nocturnes (two volumes here), from which it is suggested Chopin got the idea of employing the form. Ben Frith makes a strong case for Field, not only as a composer of pleasing Nocturnes (even if they don’t have the distinctiveness of Chopin’s), but also his seven varied concertos, to which has been added the so-called Irish Concerto in a later recording with the RSNO. The Concertos all make for attractive listening. Frith sounds accomplished throughout, and is sensitively accompanied by the Northern Sinfonia, as it then was, under the flautist-turned-conductor, David Haslam. The mid-nineties recordings sound well. If you don’t know this music, you have a treat in store should you chose to invest in this moderately priced set (around £23). Buy from Amazon > Elgar: The Wand of Youth Suites, Salut d'Amour, Nursery Suite & Chanson de NuitSir Mark Elder & Hallé OrchestraHallé Concerts Society Elgar has been brilliantly served by the Hallé’s veteran conductor Sir Mark Elder, whose recordings of Elgar rival those of his legendary predecessor in Manchester: Sir John Barbirolli. This generous 76-minute issue is dominated by the two Wand of Youth Suites in which Elgar, at the height of his powers in 1907, fashioned two delectable orchestral offerings from his childhood sketchbooks. Also of great interest is the Nursery Suite which Elgar composed very late on (in 1930) and dedicated to the two young daughters of the then-Duke and Duchess of York, the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. The Duke and Duchess took pride in this dedication and, with young Elizabeth, actually attended one of the recording sessions in May 1931. Given that provenance, it’s surprising this music isn’t better known – especially since it is actually very good. Elgar was a dab hand at light music and this CD contains remarkable examples of his powers as a melodist and orchestrator, especially since room is also found for two more miniature masterpieces, ‘Salut D’Amour’, and ‘Chanson De Nuit’.

     Every week our albums guru David Mellor reviews the best of the new releases and reissues. Schubert Symphonies 3, 5 and 8CBSO/Edward GardnerChandos Abbado Rediscovered Schubert: Symphonies Nos. 5 & 8Vienna Philharmonic & Claudio AbbadoDeutsche Grammophon This month Ed Gardner embarks on a Schubert symphony cycle with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, where he was Principal Guest conductor from 2010-2016. This is a good value, 74-minute issue, with neat, well-turned performances of Symphonies 3, 5 and 8.  It’s a backhanded compliment though to observe, as I must, that the most convincing reading here is of the clever little Third, written when Schubert was 18, and free from any of the dark eddies that later permeated Schubert’s music. After a decent enough Fifth, the least satisfying performance here is of the Unfinished, a work embarked upon, and then left as a torso of two movements, in late 1822 / early 1823, when Schubert was traumatised by learning he had Syphilis. Here we must let the best be the enemy of the good. Abbado’s Unfinished is in a different league to Gardner’s. This is a dark, deep, indeed profound account of a symphony which Abbado held dear. He chose it for his first concert as Principal Conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1989, and it opened his very last concert in Lucerne in 2013, when he plainly knew, as everyone else did, that his brave 15-year battle against cancer was about to end. The remarkable thing about this performance is that it has been dug out of the archives of the Vienna Philharmonic from 1971, when Abbado was only in his 30s. It’s a thought-provoking performance, well matched by a Fifth, where an unusually attenuated slow movement – almost three minutes longer than Gardner’s – finds eloquent pre-echoes of the mind-set of the Unfinished. Buy Schubert Symphonies 3, 5 and 8 from Amazon > Buy Abbado Rediscovered Schubert: Symphonies Nos. 5 & 8 from Amazon > Willi Boskovsky - Master of the WaltzDecca (50 CDs plus 2 DVDs)5 stars These recordings, spanning 30 years of mainly Viennese music making, from the early 50s to the late 70s, chart the remarkable career of the violinist-turned-conductor Willi Boskovsky, best known for directing the celebrated New Year’s Day Concert for 25 years. Boskovsky, born in 1909, was an exceptional violinist, who became one of the Vienna Philharmonic’s four concertmasters before he was 30. In the late forties he founded the Vienna Octet and the first 15 CDs here, from the 50s, are memorable performances of some of the greatest chamber music of Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. These were difficult times, and Boskovsky recalls founding the Octet in 1947 to play at the Lucerne Festival primarily so his colleagues could enjoy a proper meal for the first time in years! The next 15 CDs, dating from the 60s, are celebrated recordings of Mozart’s dance music and the serenades and divertimentos he wrote to be performed at grand banquets. There’s also a bonus CD here of Beethoven’s dance music. By now a popular conductor, Boskovsky formed a small instrumental group from the Philharmonic, under the name The Vienna Mozart Ensemble, and these CDs received first class reviews at the time, and still sound really well, offering a unique glimpse of a much underrated aspect of Mozart’s creative genius. Most of the remaining albums here are of Strauss family music, with several atmospheric New Year’s Day Concert recordings included, interspersed with studio recordings that were extremely well received at the time, and still sound totally idiomatic. Nobody did it better. This exceptional box with 50 CDs and 2 DVDs can be bought for around £90. Buy from Amazon > Sailing By - 25 British Light ClassicsIain Sutherland and his Concert OrchestraAlto I love light music, as regular listeners will know.  And a Light Music Master I especially enjoy, not least because he’s still around, and a great companion for lunch and a drink, is Iain Sutherland, who has taken British Light Music all over the world. He’s not just an expert conductor, but also a fine arranger, and a composer in his own right, as I showed a few Sundays back featuring three of his Scottish arrangements with the City of Glasgow Philharmonic, he conducted for so many years, in my Burns Night programme. Here we find Iain with 25 excellent pieces of British Light Music, very well recorded in the 80s. Some of this music is very well-known, like the title piece Sailing By, or masterpieces like the Dambusters March, and Percy Grainger’s Shepherd’s Hey. But, some are almost unknown. For instance I admire Ronald Binge, and three of his pieces are in our Hall of Fame, but I had never heard his Venetian Carnival until this disc appeared. Nor did I know Wilfred Joseph’s March Glorious, or Frank Bridge’s Rosemary and several others as well. Plenty to enjoy here then, at a relatively modest price for an album only 30 seconds short of 80 minutes.

     Every week our presenter David Mellor reviews the best of the new releases and re-issues from the classical world. Enigma VariationsVasily Petrenko & Royal Liverpool Philharmonic OrchestraOnyx Vasily Petrenko is a committed Elgarian whose recording of the two Symphonies I very much enjoy. Good to know that he is continuing his Elgar journey with this well chosen 66-minute album of arguably Elgar’s best known orchestral work, the Enigma Variations, coupled with his least appreciated orchestral masterpiece, ‘Alassio’ (‘In the South’), and the little piece that first showed what he was capable of, the Serenade for Strings. The Enigma is well delineated, and ‘In the South’, composed during an extended holiday on the Italian Riviera, brings out all the Richard Strauss influences. Because at that time, Strauss and Elgar had a mutual admiration society, and ‘Alassio’, is, in effect, a tone poem of a kind that Strauss used to create his reputation, like Don Juan and Macbeth for instance. The orchestra’s own recordings, issued by Onyx, do them full justice, and this is most recommendable. Buy from Amazon > The Classic André PrevinAndré Previn (55 CDs)Sony Classical The sad death of André Previn within a month of his 90th birthday allows me to re-recommend this Sony box, issued in December, which covers recordings originally made for CBS and RCA spanning almost 35 years from 1960 until 1994. Most musicians have a range of musical talents outside of their speciality, but none surely has been able to pursue so many different musical activities to the highest professional standards. A film composer and arranger for MGM from his late teens, with four Oscars to show for it, Previn started to make jazz recordings for RCA when he was only 18. He made his first recording as a classical pianist in 1960, and began his career as a symphony conductor in 1962 in St Louis. The following year he made his debut classical recording as a conductor with the same band, interestingly of Britten’s Sinfonia Da Requiem, showing early-on his lifelong passion for British music. Previn came to London in 1964 to record with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (CDs 8 and 9), and the following year began his long love affair with the London Symphony Orchestra with a dazzling recording of Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 5, which has rarely been equalled, and in my view at least, never surpassed (CD 10). Previn made no secret of his desire to take on the LSO, and in 1968 began his tenure as principal conductor. This sent shockwaves throughout the whole industry, but, as so many recordings here attest, right from the outset he displayed remarkable gifts as a symphonic conductor. He also projected the LSO to a much wider audience through his skills on TV as an educator and light entertainer. Who can forget his appearance with Morecambe and Wise? Eric breezily greeted ‘Mr Preview’, and listened unimpressed to Previn’s piano playing. “I can play the same notes as you,” Eric sniffed. “But maybe not in the same order!” It soon became obvious that Previn was more than a showbiz turn and musical populist when, between 1967 and 1972, he produced a complete Vaughan Williams symphony cycle (included here) where the interpretations were understated, not unidiomatically brash as many might have expected given Previn’s close association with Leonard Bernstein. These remain, 50 years on, a top recommendation. Previn was a celebrated interpreter of William Walton. His recording of the First Symphony from 1966 (CD 14) was among the first to fully reveal the exceptional power of this magnificent work. Fitting then that the last recording here, from 1994, is of Walton’s Viola Concerto with Yuri Bashmet. Previn is not especially renowned as a conductor of classical symphonies, but his Beethoven cycle (CDs 42-46 and 49) is well worth a listen. So are two recordings of Mozart (CDs 50-51) where Previn showed how accomplished he is as a Mozartian pianist, with the Double Concerto where he was partnered by Alicia de Larrocha, especially pleasurable. Buy from Amazon > Copland: Billy the KidLeonard Slatkin & Detroit Symphony OrchestraNaxos The only surprising thing about this issue is why it has lain in the Naxos archives since 2014. As you would expect from Slatkin, a noted interpreter of American music, and his then orchestra, the Detroit Symphony, these are vivid and idiomatic performances of two of Copland’s more fascinating scores. Billy the Kid (1934) was the first time Copland showed his extraordinary ability, as an East Coast Jewish intellectual, to put himself into the shoes of ordinary Americans, and write the sort of music about their heritage, that they wanted to hear. Billy the Kid was a short-lived outlaw, whose colourful and violent life is brilliantly depicted in this ballet, with first-class orchestral effects, all well delivered by Slatkin and the DSO. Grohg (1925) is a different kettle of fish. Every bit as interesting, but not quite as accessible. It was Copland’s first ballet, and is based on the celebrated silent film Nosferatu. Copland suppressed the score, which was only rediscovered in the 90s. A well-written and extensive liner note allows me to ask this question: What’s the link between Billy the Kid and Ben Hur? The answer is General Lew Wallace, who moonlighted as a novelist (i.e. Ben Hur), whilst also being Governor of New Mexico. In that capacity he put a price on Billy the Kid's head, thereby guaranteeing his demise, at the hands of a bounty hunting sheriff. All in all, a compelling issue for anyone who loves Americana. Buy from Amazon > ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202299.16/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320044358-20190320070358-00010.warc.gz

     Every week, Classic FM presenter and music guru David Mellor reviews the best of the new releases and re-issues from the classical world. Alongside his classical music and opera critique for the Mail on Sunday, David picks out this week’s musical highlights. Music for Horn and Orchestra by Schumann, Saint-Saëns and GlièreMarkus Maskuniitty, Sakari Oramo and the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic OrchestraOndine This enterprising album is full of high quality music that is rarely heard. The star turn here is Robert Schumann’s Konzertstück for Four Horns and Orchestra, composed in 1849, when Schumann was still at the height of his powers. It received a hugely successful premiere, but was then rarely heard, because horn players at that time were not capable of playing it properly. Its demanding virtuosity is happily no problem for Markus Maskuniitty, principal horn of the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic, and previously principal horn with the Berlin Philharmonic, and his three colleagues. Sakari Oramo conducts with real verve, making this is the finest recorded performance of this elusive, but magnificent work to have come my way. The Adagio and Allegro for horn and piano was completed the day before Schumann embarked on the Konzertstück. It appears here orchestrated by the late conductor, Ernest Ansermet. Also included is the endearing Horn Concerto of Reinhold Glière (1875-1956) who wrote the piece right at the end of his life. Glière burbles away in a tuneful, romantic vein, and Maskuniitty plays very well. Also worthy of attention is Saint-Saëns’ Morceau de Concert, an engaging miniature for horn and orchestra that I guarantee you will enjoy. Pre-order here > This week, I shine a light on a particular conductor who has just celebrated his 90th birthday. Although Bernard Haitink has just turned 90, he is still busy conducting the world’s finest orchestras. He can be found this Thursday, and the following one, conducting the LSO at the Barbican. You can get your tickets here. Haitink has been part of my musical life since the early seventies, when he headed up the London Philharmonic, as well as the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, with whom he made the pioneering complete cycles of the symphonies of Bruckner and Mahler. Mahler: The Symphonies & Song CyclesBernard Haitink and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (12 CDs)Decca Haitink, alongside Leonard Bernstein among others, was a Mahler pioneer. Bernstein offered the more vivid experience, but Haitink with his sensible, non-hysterical approach to a composer who needs no sprayed-on hysteria from the conductor, was, and remains a most eloquent and persuasive interpreter, as these CDs readily show. They have been completely remastered, and sound very well. Perhaps it can be argued that the ‘Resurrection’ Symphony No. 2 lacks a sense of occasion, but elsewhere, Haitink is extremely persuasive, notably in the sprawling third, a hymn of praise to the countryside, and the ninth, written despairingly in the shadow of early death. I remember buying the ninth symphony back in 1972 on LP, and being swept away by it. I still am. This set, though a bit more expensive than one might ideally wish at around £55, because of the remastering costs, is made unmissable by the song cycle with orchestra, notably Das Lied von der Erde with James King, and the incomparable Dame Janet Baker. Buy from Amazon > Bruckner: The Complete Symphonies & Te DeumBernard Haitink and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (12 CDs)Decca At the same time as he was pioneering Mahler, Haitink recorded in Amsterdam the symphonies of Bruckner, who was also relatively unknown to many music lovers at that time. Haitink was also very active with Bruckner in the concert hall. I remember a number of London concerts in the early seventies, where audiences leapt to their feet at the end, because of Haitink’s persuasive advocacy. It may be that Karajan brought more grandeur, and Eugen Jochum more spirituality in their sets, but Haitink’s sanity, objectivity, and sheer musicality, still works for me. Once again this set has been remastered, so the sound is much improved from previous incarnations. In both these sets, a Blu-ray disc is also included.

CRITIC'S CHOICE Traffic Quintet plays Alexandre DesplatMercury 4812172 Alexandre Desplat is a coming man, winning his first Oscar last year for The Grand Budapest Hotel. Surprisingly that doesn’t appear on this intriguing Traffic Quintet album, where 13 of Desplat’s scores, including The Kings Speech and The Girl With A Pearl Earring are re-imagined for piano quintet, with occasional interventions from the composer himself, on flute, glockenspiel and celesta. Desplat first worked with Traffic Quintet on a French movie, and was extremely impressed by the wonderful tone and technique of the lead violinist.  Through her advice, he says, he gained the confidence, hitherto lacking, to write for strings, and also learned much from her about the Baroque. This album, says Desplat, brilliantly reimagines these scores for a different medium, “catching their essence and at the same time highlighting the musical sensibilities of each of the quintet’s members”. This is very sophisticated late evening listening, and no movie buff should be without it. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon > Alexandre Desplat: The Danish GirlOriginal SoundtrackDecca UMO Classics Desplat’s latest score is splendidly played by members of the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by the composer, with a prominent part for piano soloist Dave Arch. It doesn’t need the movie to be attractive listening. There are some good ideas here, very well-orchestrated, with Arch’s contribution, especially notable. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >  Nocturnos de AndalucíaChristoph DenothSignum SIGCD444The ever versatile LSO also features on this exceptional album, where the London-based guitarist Christoph Denoth winningly mixes the familiar and the unfamiliar. His account of Rodrigo’s evergreen Concierto de Aranjuez, with the orchestra winningly conducted by the veteran Spanish conductor Jesús López Cobos, is excellent, and can be highly placed in a competitive field. But the real reason for buying this well filled 68-minute album is the fill-ups. Lorenzo Palomo’s Nocturnos de Andalucía is a substantial 40-minute, six movement piece for guitar and orchestra, which revisits the same Spanish themes and moods that so inspired the great late-19th century Spanish guitar virtuoso/composers. It’s attractive, without ever being too comfortable, and backward looking.  It’s very cleverly scored for large orchestra, and will give much pleasure. There’s also a delightful lollipop at the end, with Denoth’s own arrangement for guitar and orchestra of Joaquín Malats’ Serenata Espanola – 4½ minutes of pure joy. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >   Bach: Keyboard MusicNelson FreireDecca 4788449 When I sometimes complain about short weight on CDs, what I mean is, that here Decca squeeze 81 minutes 44 seconds of exquisite Bach playing on to this album, so why do we still get from so many labels, discs that run to only 50 minutes or so. This is a self-recommending issue, consisting of some of the finest ever transcriptions of Bach’s most enticing keyboard music.  Stuff like Dame Myra Hess’s arrangement of Jesu Joy of Man’s Desiring and Busoni’s transcription of Ich Ruf' zu Dir, Herr Jesu Christ, both of which I shall be playing in my show from 7pm on Sunday night. After listening to this album you will surely wonder, as I did, why Freire has left it so late to produce his first all-Bach album. Some purists sniff at Bach on the grand piano. Hearing this, I cannot understand why. Download from iTunes >Buy from Amazon >   Janacek:  Orchestral Works, Vol. 3Bergen Symphony Orchestra/Edward GardnerChandos CHSA5165 This one doesn’t quite do what it says on the tin, in that the main work, 39 minutes long, it Janacek’s out-of-left-field choral masterpiece, the Glagolitic Mass.  But who’s complaining when the goods are so well delivered as here, with a distinguished team of soloists led by the Australian heldentenor Stuart Skelton, and more fine singing from no less than four Norwegian choruses. The Bergen Philharmonic under their new chief, play really well, and prove yet again they are currently Scandinavia’s finest.  Gardner has a real affinity with twentieth century music, as he proves yet again.Buy from Amazon > David Mellor is Opera and Classical Critic of the Mail on Sunday and presenter of his own show on Classic FM, Sundays 7pm.

             Throughout the week Classic FM’s presenters bring you the best new recordings, including world exclusives and premiere broadcasts of latest releases.  John Suchet plays a track from his featured album at 10:15am every weekday. Onyx Petrenko’s Tchaikovsky promises to be one of the most important orchestral releases of 2017. Universal praise from reviewers for the first volume of Symphonies 1, 2 and 5 bodes well for this eagerly-awaited release: Gramophone gave Volume One an Editor’s choice and it reigned as a top 10 UK Classical chart title for 7 weeks in 2016. Released on Friday 20th January 2017.  John Brunning plays a track from his featured album after 6pm every weekday. Sony As one of the most spectacular, most modern and most expensive buildings in the world, the Elbphilharmonie has already attracted a great amount of positive attention not only in Germany, but worldwide.  The new Grand Hall in the Elbphilharmonie is already considered to be one of the most beautiful and best concert halls in the world. This very first recording captures the fantastic sound of the new Grand Hall, which was designed by Yasuhisa Toyota, one of the world’s best acousticians.  Last week's opening of the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg marks the beginning of a new ear for the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra, formerly the NDR Symphony Orchestra, as they will become orchestra in residence at the Elbphilharmonie, making its musical home after a 70-year history. The orchestra’s programme will play a major role in shaping the artistic profile of this spectacular new concert hall.  The music director of the Elbphilharmonie, Thomas Hengelbrock, is known for his imagination, musicological passion for discovery and his uncompromising manner of music-making, making him one of the most sought-after conductors of our time.     Sony  This 2017 New Year’s Concert double album is one of the most successful in the series. Appropriately so, since two big anniversaries are being celebrated here: the 175th of the Vienna Philharmonic and the 150th of the most famous of all Strauss pieces, The Blue Danube waltz, which is, as always, an encore here. This concert’s success was guaranteed by the charismatic and idiomatic conducting of Gustavo Dudamel; the terrific playing of the Vienna Philharmonic; and a fascinating programme in which eight of the 17 pre-encore pieces were new to this now 80-year-old series. I was there in Vienna on New Year’s Day and loved every moment of it. The Golden Hall of the Musikverein is surely the most beautiful concert hall in the world, its shoebox shape guaranteeing excellent acoustics. I worried how much of the magic of one of the greatest musical experiences of my life would transfer on to CD. I needn’t have. These CDs are full of good things, with the recording capturing the atmosphere, the enthusiastic audience, and fully reproducing the beautiful sound of one of the world’s greatest orchestras. The playing of the strings had a silky refinement throughout. The accuracy of the playing evidenced much careful preparation, and some of the solos, such as the first horn in Waldteufel’s The Skaters’ Waltz, were stunningly beautiful. This was one of this year’s eight debutants, as was a fine overture, Pique Dame, by the forgotten father of Viennese operetta, Franz von Suppé. There were also new and enjoyable Strauss novelties, such as Johann II’s The Extravagant Waltz, named after a lawyers’ ball in Vienna in 1858, and his fast polka, Let’s Dance. Dudamel, a product of the Venezuelan ‘sistema’, who made his reputation conducting the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra and now heads up the Los Angeles Philharmonic, had no background to speak of in Viennese music.  But he plainly put in the hard yards, conducting everything from memory, a remarkable feat in a more than two-hour concert, and showing a real feel for this music. The orchestra plainly respected him, and by the end the audience loved him too, especially the way he conducted us rather than the band in a much more orderly than usual clapping during the final encore, Johann Strauss I’s Radetzky March. The New Year’s Concert isn’t cheap: my front-row balcony seat cost €840. But it’s worth every cent. And for a fraction of that, you can enjoy this memorable recording. The concert was an invention of the Nazis, first held on December 31, 1939. From these inauspicious beginnings has come an event that once exemplified world chaos but now emphasises global togetherness. The audience was from all over the world, and TV viewers numbered some 40 million. Long may it flourish.   Deutsche Grammophon  Gustavo Dudamel had his first date with the Vienna Philharmonic in Lucerne in 2007, and has worked regularly with them since.  It looks as though this is a relationship both parties want to develop further. A good thing in my view, because my positive feelings about his rapport with the orchestra set out above, continue with this Russian programme, recorded in the Golden Hall last April. Pictures, in the orchestration by Ravel, is beautifully played, and the more relaxed and lyrical moments fall easily on the ear.  Perhaps the conclusion, Baba-Yaga and the Great Gate Of Kiev, are not as overwhelming as in some performances.  But over all this is a thoroughly musical account.  And rather proves that Dudamel does better with a long established European orchestra, used to playing this stuff, than he does in Los Angeles, where he is Music Director.  I have sometimes felt his performances there of Beethoven, Mahler and other such stuff don’t really catch fire. The only disappointment here is the fill-ups - Night On Bare Mountain, and the Waltz from Swan Lake, aren’t really adequate duration wise.  Only 50 minutes of music on this CD is too miserly these days. Sony (2CDs)  I can’t get away from the Vienna Philharmonic, or indeed the Golden Hall.  These recordings featuring the veteran Austrian pianist Rudolf Buchbinder were also set down in the Golden Hall in the spring of 2015. The orchestra played very well for the veteran Zubin Mehta, who was of course Vienna trained, and has been conducting the orchestra for more than 50 years.  Buchbinder and Mehta’s expertise, and the beauty of tone of the Viennese players, makes for charming listening.  These are really idiomatic performances. Do they storm the heights like Gilels, Richter, Pollini, and others?  No, but this is still a most satisfying listen. Buchbinder was in the recording studios a lot as a young man, and then little was heard of him.   Let’s hope these recordings presage a glorious Indian summer for him, now he is in his 70s.   Buy from Amazon > Deutsche Grammophon (22CDs)  David Oistrakh ranks alongside his fellow Russian, Jascha Heifetz, as the most important violinist of the 20th century. Oistrakh was a powerful player, whose deep musicianship in this inexpensive box (22Cds for £45 or less) encompasses compelling performances of baroque music – there’s some especially glorious Bach – and some truly extraordinary performances of what was, for him contemporary music, which, incidentally, made him Shostakovich’s favourite interpreter. Sadly there’s no Shostakovich here, but plenty of Prokofiev, who rated him equally highly. Amongst other highlights are arguably the finest of the several recordings he made of two favourite party pieces, the concertos of Tchaikovsky and Brahms, set down in Dresden in 1954 when he was in his absolute prime.  There’s also a strikingly eclectic selection of chamber music, notably a complete set of Beethoven Sonatas from 1962 with the distinguished pianist Lev Oborin. Another favourite performance of mine, included here is his London recording of Bruch’s Scottish Fantasy with the LSO, which captures things other violinists miss. Oistrakh succumbed to a heart attack in Amsterdam in 1974 whilst on tour, aged only 66. Although its more than 40 years since I last saw him play live, I remember every detail.  Built like an all-in wrestler, with enormously powerful shoulders, Oistrakhs manner on the platform was kindly and avuncular (and indeed no one ever said a bad word about him). But when he stuck his violin into one of his many jowls, and really got going, he was a man transformed, whose playing made it impossible for an audience not to be swept away. This exceptional DG box shows a total master of his craft at work, and shouldn’t be missed.

135,classicfm.com/discover-music/,classical,https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/album-reviews/elgar-tchaikovsky-williams/," 27 March 2017, 10:00 | Updated: 15 June 2017, 15:20  Throughout the week Classic FM’s presenters bring you the best new recordings, including world exclusives and premiere broadcasts of latest releases.  John Suchet plays a track from his featured album at 10.15am every weekday.  Over the 90-year history of sound film, there have been a handful of instances where a director and a composer have formed a longtime partnership that resulted in a series of classical scores, creating music that stands the test of time. None, however, have been as long or as fruitful as the 43-year collaboration of Steven Spielberg and John Williams. None have encompassed such a wide range of subject matter or, more significantly, have had such an enormous impact on worldwide popular culture. From the ominous shark signature of Jaws to the five-note alien greeting of Close Encounters of the Third Kind; from the heroic march of Raiders of the Lost Ark to the moving themes for Schindler's List the music Williams has written for more than two dozen Spielberg projects has not only served them brilliantly but entered the wider public consciousness.With a record fifty Academy Award nominations (more than any other composer) Williams has demonstrated, again and again, his ability to connect with audiences, both in the movie theatre and in the concert hall. Seventeen of those nominations, and three of Williams' five Oscar wins (Jaws, E.T. and Schindler s List) have been for Spielberg films. The sheer variety of music, the depth of compositional skill on display, the powerful emotions that it evokes, makes John Williams & Steven Spielberg: The Ultimate Collection an extraordinary accomplishment. This is the work of one of America's greatest composers, inspired by the work of one of America s greatest filmmakers.  John Brunning plays a track from his featured album at 6.15pm every weekday. Pentatone The profoundly moving, elegiac lyricism of Elgar and the wistful charm and brilliance of Tchaikovsky are on full display in this irresistible new release from Pentatone played with consummate virtuosity by the German-Canadian cellist Johannes Moser with the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande under Andrew Manze.  Composed at the end of the First World War, Elgar's powerful Cello Concerto in E minor is one of his best-loved and most deeply-felt works. The soloist's wrenching chords which open the work announce a mood of profound resignation and loss - gone is the youthful swagger of his earlier works, replaced instead with lonely introspection and longing, especially in the sublimely beautiful Adagio. The cello is given free rein in the vigorous final movement but the opening mood prevails as an anguished outburst from the cello brings the work to a close.  No such dejection hangs over Tchaikovsky's delightful Variations on a Rococo Theme which ooze elegance, ineffable charm and daring displays of technical brilliance. While the Pezzo capriccioso finds Tchaikovsky in a more restrained mood, with the Nocturne and Andante Cantabile he wears his romantic heart full on his sleeve. The great Russian writer Leon Tolstoy is said to have wept when he heard the Andante Cantabile and its sumptuous theme shows Tchaikovsky's unerring gift for haunting melodies. It remains a special gem in the repertoire.  The cellist Johannes Moser is no stranger to these works. Winner of the top prize at the 2002 Tchaikovsky Competition, he was also awarded the Special Prize for his interpretation of the Variations on a Rococo Theme. Described by Gramophone as ""one of the finest among the astonishing gallery of young virtuoso cellists"" and by the LA Times as a musician who ""...connects with the audience in a way that only great artists do"", this is Moser's third recording for Pentatone.     Deutsche Grammophon  Rafał Blechacz, winner of the prestigious Chopin International Competition in 2005, has now produced a fine new recital of Bach on the grand piano, where he plays with great eloquence, and the piano sound is excellent throughout.  It used to be controversial to perform Bach on the grand piano.  I don’t think it is now, and Bach’s rhythms and melodies often sound so much better on the grand piano than they do on the harpsicord.  Blechacz says of Bach’s music “Of course, it’s very important to be well informed about the baroque style and about the works and the composer.  But sometimes I fell that it’s even more important to listen to your own heart, and to your intuition”. A dangerous philosophy for a wayward pianist.  I’d hate to hear Lang Lang play Bach on those principles!  But Blechacz has taste and discretion and this is an extremely well chosen recital, with two keyboard partitas rubbing shoulders with more popular stuff like the Italian Concerto, and Myra Hess’s arrangement of Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring.  I shall be playing the middle section of the Italian Concerto, and Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring on my Sunday programme devoted to Bach at 7pm on April 9th.     Warners (13CDs)   Georg Philipp Telemann was regarded in his own time as a great composer.  He was Music Director in Hamburg, a far more significant post than Bach ever occupied, at the very least he would be regarded as the equal of Bach, and of Handel.  So what happened to Telemann? And more significantly, could he rise again? This 13CD Warners set, a snip at under £30, enjoys the formidable advocacy of musicians such as the late Nikolaus Harnoncourt, and the recorder player and conductor Frans Brüggen.  Other formidable musicians pop up in this collection like the flautist Emmanuel Pahud, and the oboist Albrecht Mayer. A full range of orchestral music plus some choral music is provided here.  The recordings span more than 40 years from the early 60s, and inevitably the sound is a bit varied.  But nevertheless, anyone who enjoys baroque music should know at least some of the compositions of the hugely prolific Telemann, and this is a very good way in, although, as so often with Warners, the documentation is scanty. Purchase the boxset from Amazon here.   Ondine  The British based Spanish flautist and conductor Jamie Martin has been associated with this Swedish Orchestra for four years now, and they play very well for him, on a most enticing 72minute issue.  Brahms wrote both his serenades whilst in his late 20s and still nerving himself to write a symphony. The First Symphony is a bucolic affair, and best treated as an entertaining divertissement.  The Second Serenade, with no upper strings, is a more intimate piece, written as an act of homage to Mozart’s Wind Serenades. What’s in a name?  People sometimes ask.  In music, quite a lot.  By calling these pieces Serenades, Brahms almost certainly condemned them to neglect and underestimation.  They never appear in concert programmes, and are rarely heard on the radio.  But happily, there are some good recordings around, notably one with Riccardo Chailly and the Gewandhaus Orchestra on Decca. Even if that remains first choice, this Ondine issue is worthy of being mentioned in the same breath, and if you don’t know this music, you have a treat in store discovering it.    Sony (2CDs)   Artur Schnabel was the leading Beethoven pianist of the 1930s, who recorded the first complete Beethoven Piano Sonata cycle, to great acclaim.  Schnabel went to America during the war, and made some recordings in 1942, that are now reissued, very well transferred, in this enticing set. CD1 features Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto and No4, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under their long serving Music Director Frederick Stock.  Are these recordings better than the HMV ones made in the 30s in London with Malcolm Sargent?     Hard to say, but there’s no doubt the RCA recordings sound better.  Schnabel was a pianist of great historical significance, so anyone with an interest in historical recordings, and the development of the performing style should get these. In some ways CD 2 is even more interesting, where Beethoven’s Piano Sonatas Nos 30 & 32 are paired with Schubert’s Four Impromptus which have never before been issued.  Schubert’s son, Karl-Ulrich couldn’t think of any reason why his father would not allow them to be issued, and I agree.   This is a fascinating set from a pianist who was far from technically perfect, but had an innate understanding of the classical style, and whose performances always reward attention. Fanny Waterman, the Founder of the Leeds Piano Competition, once told me that Schnabel had observed to her; “Lots of pianists can play the notes as well as I can.  It’s my pauses and rests that are the thing”.  Indeed so, and there’s ample proof of that in these fascinating recordings. You can purchase the CD from Amazon here. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202496.35/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321051516-20190321073516-00336.warc.gz

Paul Carr’s music shows that at his best, he’s a composer as fine as any operating in this vein today.  The Performance: That said, the quality offered here does vary. Holding The Stars and Now Comes Beauty are short, beautifully composed settings of two of Carr’s own texts for unaccompanied choir, each one deeply memorable. They’re wonderfully sung, too, by Chorus Angelorum – who also sound swept up, like the two fine soloists, by the sincere emotional world of Requiem for Angel. But even with an orchestral accompaniment to help, 50 minutes is a long listen when there aren’t enough real contrasts of pace or mood between the eight movements.  The Verdict:  You won’t hear Carr's limited, but appealing music better performed: the singing and playing are excellent from start to finish.  Want more?

John Suchet plays a track from his featured album at 10:15am every weekday. Deutsche Grammophon   Twenty years ago I came up with a concept that I called “For Seasons”. Since then it has evolved. Mankind has been fascinated by the seasons for an eternity. Hippocrates advised, “Look to the seasons when choosing your cures”; Albert Camus reflected: “In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.” The quarterly divisions of the year are characterized by weather, the hours of daylight, the changes in nature and the cumulative effect of these on mankind, flora and fauna. This album takes Vivaldi’s masterpiece one step further – by placing it in the context of a 21st-century climatic response: the 12 months are each represented by a specific piece of music. And in turn, 12 visual artists respond to the music and to the seasons. Let us hope we may all live in a world in which seasons not only exist, but in which their beauty is globally protected. And that they continue to enchant and inspire us. - Daniel Hope  John Brunning plays a track from his featured album after 6pm every weekday. Avie  Gramophone Award-winning Adrian Chandler and his period-instrument ensemble La Serenissima present The Italian Job, a collection of colourful concertos by composers from four cities with a rich musical heritage: Venice (Albinoni, Caldara, Vivaldi), Bologna (Torelli), Padua (Tartini) and Rome (Corelli). The Italian Job, offers a feast of instrumental colour featuring oboes, bassoons, trumpets, trombone, timpani, strings and continuo, by some of the finest composers of the Italian baroque. Onyx  This superb album may be the best yet from Liverpool’s resident Elgarian, Vasily Petrenko, and the brilliantly responsive orchestra he has fashioned on Merseyside. Even if you have a recording of Elgar’s Second, you should get this one, because Petrenko’s understanding of this elusive and problematic piece is so profound. The Second Symphony is on a journey.  A similar journey to that undertaken by the Cello Concerto, whose premiere was a total fiasco, not merely a disappointment like the Second.  And yet, for maybe half a century now, the Cello Concerto has been seen as Elgar’s most powerful work; a piece that speaks to us of our own insecurities, and whose angst sounds very contemporary. All this is true of the Second Symphony, and Petrenko gets it.  He really does, perhaps assisted by his understanding of Shostakovich, another composer who, for different reasons, had to cover his tracks in his music, and couldn’t reveal his true thoughts and feelings, because he’d have ended up in a Gulag if he had. Petrenko takes his time – almost an hour – but the music never sprawls.  Indeed the Scherzo, third movement marked presto, is really well delineated, at the composers chosen speed.  But Petrenko still finds time to bring out incidental details, like the percussive hammering in the middle, that, he seems to be suggesting, is premonitory of the carnage shortly to come in the First World War. The real magic in this performance happens in the first movement.   After the very direct Mozart 40/Brahms 3 inspired opening – this symphony is full of German references, especially Wagner, who’s all over it like a rash - Petrenko takes us on an eerie tour of Elgar’s mind, establishing a dreamy and rapt mood, full of insights that holds the key to what this symphony is really all about.  The recording, made in Liverpool last spring, is first class, and the three pieces of light music that complete this magnificent CD, make for delightful, effortless listening. Decca  Youthful prodigy cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason is only 17, and still studying for his A levels. But his talents have already been recognised by Decca, amongst others, and this debut EP shows why many repose such hope in him.  Notably his teacher and inspiration Julian Lloyd Webber, who thinks young Sheku is the real deal. The three pieces on this album show his range, maturity, and the beauty of tone he already draws from his instrument. A lot of people will have seen him perform this arrangement of Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah at the BAFTAs.  Also included here is a very Julian-like piece, Faure’s Apres un reve, and Sheku’s own arrangement of Bloch’s Abodah. Well worth hearing.   This generous 77 minutes album celebrates Chailly’s arrival as Music Director at La Scala, in a very original way.  The orchestra perform 14 overtures and intermezzi from operas given their premieres at La Scala.   Some of them are well known, like Bellini’s Norma, and Puccini’s Madam Butterfly.  Others are quite well known, like Catalani’s La Wally and Boito’s Mefistofele.  Others are totally unknown, like Giordano’s Siberia (yes, really!) and Leoncavallo’s I Medici as well as, of course, his much better known Pagliacci.  A fascinating, and really worthwhile issue.  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203491.1/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324190033-20190324212033-00461.warc.gz

Ensemble Plus Ultra is an extraordinarily gifted group of British singers, specialising in early music.  Subtitled 'The Sacred Polyphony of El Greco's Toledo', their new album marks the 400th anniversary of the death of the painter El Greco and showcases composers such as Cristobal de Morales, Alonso Lobo and Alonso de Tejeda who were active in Toledo during the 37 years El Greco lived and worked in the city. It is probable that much of this music would have inspired the painter. Particularly outstanding is the music of Morales, the most influential Spanish composer of his day.

It’s a time for reaching out to those in need and it can be a time to remember those who are no longer with us. At the heart of those moments, music is there to help us make sense of it all. Early this year I set out to reflect the true soundtrack to Christmas in Britain. I visited community halls, schools, workplaces and people’s homes, recording the sounds I heard and weaving them into this album. It’s full of personal moments: from my first-ever publicly performed teenage composition to a song written last year in response to the ongoing refugee crisis and a song recorded in the shed at the bottom of my garden. You will know many of the songs but they have been reimagined for my choir ‘Voices’ and this extraordinary line-up of British musicians both professional and amateur. From Glasgow to Cornwall, Cardiff to Belfast I found a tapestry of musical delights with bell ringers, brass bands, community choirs, children’s voices and some of my musical friends as soloists. I wish you a very happy Christmas and all the joy that music can bring.” - Gareth Malone  Buy from Amazon > Buy from iTunes >  John Brunning plays pieces from a new release after 6pm every weekday. PENTATONE Together for the first time in the recording studio, the sisters Mari and Momo Kodama are on scintillating form in these lively arrangements of music from Tchaikovskys ballets Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty and Nutcracker. In another first, the release contains the first ever recording of Arenskys transcription of the timeless Nutcracker together with notable arrangements by Debussy and Rachmaninov.  Tchaikovsky was really the first composer to combine a broad sweep of ballet music with a great story, the Kodama sisters write in their introduction to the release, before that, it more resembled a compilation of pieces in all three works there is folkloric and popular music. He has the great skill to make such vivid colours and textures on a large canvas. This makes his orchestral works very special. Our challenge was to use just two pianos to bring the same sense of scale, they write, with just two pianos the atmosphere is more intimate, it brings a different quality to the music. And the composers who made the transcriptions brought their own personality to bear on the works. So we tried to reflect that in our playing.  The sisters Mari and Momo Kodama both pursue busy international careers. Momo specialises in French and Japanese composers and 20th century and contemporary composers; she has been widely praised for her attractive, lyrical tone and technical brilliance. Mari has established an international reputation for profound musicality and articulate virtuosity; she has recorded extensively for PENATONE, including an acclaimed cycle of the complete Beethoven piano sonatas.  Buy from Amazon > Buy from iTunes >  Deutsche Grammophon  Once you get by the rather gauche title, which grates on me every time I see it, this is an exceptional recital. Barenboim is, of course, these days primarily a conductor, and there have been times when his piano playing has been less than top class.  As, for instance, a recent visit to London, when he played the two Brahms Piano Concertos really not very well. Watch: Barenboim unveils his new piano > But everything here, in this mixed bag from Scarlatti to Liszt is terrific. It’s a recital to sit down and enjoy at a single sitting. The three Scarlatti sonatas, chosen from the many dozen available, have wonderful bounce and verve, and, thanks to the composer, some exceptional melodic content. Those who sniff at baroque music on the grand piano are made to look foolish by Barenboim’s brilliance.  I also enjoyed Liszt’s Funérailles, and the same composer’s arrangement of music from the end of Parsifal.  Only the little set of Beethoven variations – a strong candidate for the least distinguished music Beethoven ever wrote – require some effort to enjoy, but otherwise, this is a real winner for any pianophiles. Buy from Amazon > Buy from iTunes > Deutsche Grammophon  I heard Batiashvili and Barenboim play the Tchaikovsky in a London concert 18 months ago, and wasn’t that impressed. But they sound fine here, especially in the first movement of the Tchaikovsky.  Batiashvili does not banish memories of great violinists of a previous generation, who made the Tchaikovsky their party piece, notably Jascha Heifetz and David Oistrakh. Or indeed, amongst women players, Ginette Neveu in the Sibelius.  But we cannot live in the past, and the reality is, Batiashvili performs these two concertos well enough for perpetuation on CD. Barenboim and his splendid orchestra – arguably better these days than the Berlin Phil - accompany attentively, and DG’s recording is first class. Giving a music lover for Christmas Barenboim the pianist and Barenboim the conductor, will bring much joy. This CD testifies yet again to Barenboim’s accomplishment and versatility.  Buy from Amazon > Buy from iTunes > Deutsche Harmonia Mundi  This week’s choice from left field is rather an enchanting one, featuring music by the English viol player Christopher Simpson (1605-1669). He’s a new name on me, as is his Four Seasons. Inevitably they are not as distinctive, or melodic, as Vivaldi’s, written a century later, but as played by the Sirius Trio, full of good things. Obviously a lot of Simpson’s music comes down to us less than fully fleshed out. So what the Sirius trio has done is add in a small backing ensemble of instruments available in 17th-century England, including a small chamber organ.  I am not in any position to judge what Christopher Simpson would have thought of their efforts, but I find this album most engaging.    Buy from Amazon >  Buy from iTunes > Sony   This handy new Sony issue allows collectors to investigate two of Schumann’s finest, but least appreciated, works. The Cello Concerto may not be as good as the celebrated Piano Concerto, but I always thoroughly enjoy it, especially the eloquent slow movement.  Jan Vogler plays well, and Ivor Bolton directs a good performance from the Dresden Festival Orchestra, even though their ensemble falls well short of the best that German orchestras can do in this repertoire.   This is even more true of the Second Symphony.  But even if they are not the Berlin Philharmonic, this band, founded as recently as 2012, does okay in a piece that includes one of the finest slow movements in any 19th century symphony. Buy from Amazon > Buy from iTunes > Sony  Leontyne Price, who is happily still alive and well in her 80s, was for 30 years one of the finest Verdi/Puccini sopranos. Her voice had amplitude, richness, and, in her absolute prime, a wondrously creamy tone.  She was also a singer of great intelligence, who made the most of roles like Aida because she was also a striking physical presence on stage, which added to her allure, in an era when black sopranos in leading opera houses, especially in America, were a rarity.   The US, much given to lecturing the rest of us on human rights etc, had an appalling record in allowing black artists into major opera houses, like the Met. It was really only after World War 2 that singers like Price were given an equal shake with their white equivalents.  Price was therefore a trailblazer, as well as a great artist, and these operas are a fitting tribute to her capabilities.   It’s a sign of her stature, and a great help to us as we listen to these CDs, that RCA engaged outstanding conductors to work with her, notably Herbert von Karajan, and also excellent support from other major singers.  Well worth having, though the price - around £80, maybe more, for 22CDs - isn’t the greatest bargain I have encountered this year.  Buy from Amazon > ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204885.27/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326075019-20190326101019-00224.warc.gz

John Suchet plays a track from his featured album at 10:15am every weekday. Fashion expert, award-winning TV presenter and author Gok Wan made his mark by giving women the confidence to appreciate their bodies and brings out the inner-diva in everyone. Gok has a passion for opera – the music, the drama, the costumes, the spectacle – and above all: The Diva! Gok’s Divas brings together some of the most celebrated and beautiful showstoppers from the opera world, from La Boheme to Les Miserables. Gok has curated the album, infusing his well-known passion into the project. ""I think I first discovered opera in the 1980s,” Gok says. “I remember watching a film called The Hunger, with Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie. It was about vampires, and it had this song in it, The Flower Duet by Delibes, which I just absolutely loved. My ear immediately became sensitive to it."" ""Opera, as we know it, is quite a closed community. But I wanted to build bridges for people who felt just like me, people who loved the music and wanted to find out more, I suppose I’m here to say: Opera is for everybody. It’s for all of us."" He has been developing that ear ever since. By his late teens, he was studying performing arts. ""That was when I started listening to opera more and more: to Madame Butterfly, to Tosca and Puccini and beyond. The more I heard, the more I loved."" The album features 30 classic numbers from opera and musical theatre, including works by Puccini, Bellini and Mozart alongside Bizet, Gershwin and Bernstein along with favourite performances by Maria Callas singing Casta Diva, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa singing Un bel di vedremo and Montserrat Caballé’s O Mio babbino Caro. The album also features some newer versions of old classics such as Natasha Marsh with Alfie Boe singing the ‘drinking song’ from Verdi’s ‘La Traviata’ and Katherine Jenkins singing the original French language version of I Dreamed A Dream from ‘Les Miserables’. Gok’s Divas will have you falling in love with opera as much as Gok has!   John Brunning plays a track from his featured album after 6pm every weekday.  2CELLOS, music's most electric and dynamic instrumental duo, go to the movies for their new album Score. Bringing 2CELLOS' game-changing sound and style to the most popular melodies ever written for classic and contemporary movies and television, Score finds Croatian cellists Luka Sulic and Stjepan Hauser exploring a more traditional sound-world. Joining them here to provide the ideal aural backdrop to their virtuosity is the London Symphony Orchestra, with conductor/arranger Robin Smith at the helm. Sulic and Hauser also co-produced Score with Nick Patrick (Jackie Evancho, Il Divo, Placido Domingo).On Score, themes that drove some of the biggest block-busters in film and television history are featured in fresh new treatments including an arrangement of Ramin Djawadi's melodies that score Game of Thrones, Oscar-winning themes from James Horner's Titanic (""My Heart Will Go On""), John Williams' Schindler's List and Vangelis's Chariots of Fire, as well as ""For the Love of a Princess"" from Braveheart (also by Horner); ""May It Be"" from The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (introduced in the film by Enya); and the inspiring ""Now We Are Free"" from Gladiator, by the film's composer Hans Zimmer, Lisa Gerrard and Klaus Badelt.The vocal beauty of the cello's sound is also a perfect match for a brace of romantic themes, which include the Henry Mancini/Johnny Mercer song ""Moon River"" from Breakfast at Tiffany's; Ennio Morricone's beautiful themes for Cinema Paradiso and Malena; Nino Rota's love theme for The Godfather; Francis Lai's Oscar-winning theme from Love Story; Hans Zimmer's theme from Rain Man; and Stanley Myers' haunting ""Cantilena"" heard in The Deer Hunter.2CELLOS have forged a signature style that breaks down the boundaries between genres of music, from classical and film music to pop and rock. As impressive when playing Bach and Vivaldi as they are when rocking out, Sulic and Hauser know no limits when it comes to performing live. They have sold out shows around the globe and also performed with Sir Elton John as part of his band, as well as opening his shows to rapturous acclaim. 2CELLOS are the first instrumentalists to be featured on Glee. They have also appeared multiple times on The Today Show and The Ellen DeGeneres Show in addition to The Tonight Show, The Bachelor Live Wedding Special among others.    Two important anniversaries approach from the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, widely regarded as the cellist of the twentieth century. The 10th anniversary of his death falls on 27th April, and the 90th anniversary of his birth falls later this month. In honour of these milestones, both Deutsche Grammophon and Warner have gone to town with bumper boxes worth of any discriminating collectors attention. Normally, I confine my recording of the week to new recordings, but the significance of these issues  means they are my joint recordings of the week. Deutsche Grammophon (37 CDs)  I put the DG box first, because if forced to choose it would be the DG box, on balance, I would select. Amongst the gems to be found here is, in my view, the finest ever recording of Dvorak’s Cello Concerto with Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic, coupled with a magical performance of Tchaikovsky’s underrated Rococo Variations. DG also draw on recordings made in the 50s and 60s by their now deceased sister label Philips, including the complete Beethoven Cello Sonatas with Richter, the Brahms Sonatas with Serkin, and a much later DG recording of the Beethoven Trios with Mutter. Also invaluable, this time from the Decca catalogue, are the recordings he made in Aldeburgh with Benjamin Britten.  A dozen of these CDs feature Rostropovich as a conductor.  As a cellist he had a passionate commitment to the music, a remarkable tone, and an ability to interpret cello music in ways that were, for the most part, utterly convincing.  As a conductor he was more wayward.  Nevertheless, the passion of the finest ballet music is well conveyed in suites from Prokofiev’s Romeo and Juliet, and from the celebrated Tchaikovsky Ballets.  Interesting, but of more questionable worth are complete recordings of Tchaikovsky’s Queen of Spades, and Puccini’s Tosca, featuring his wife, the soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, a formidable singer in her time, but in both of these recordings, captured past her best. Available to purchase from Amazon.  Warner Classics, 40CDs, 3DVDs.  Warners are sometimes extremely casual about the extraordinary archive they inherited from EMI, as in their recent badly curated, shoddily presented supposed tribute to Dinu Lipatti to celebrate his centenary. But sometimes they go to town, as they did when remastering the entire Callas catalogue. And now they’ve done it again for Rostropovich, with recordings made primarily for EMI, but some valuable ones for Erato, and a collection of Russian derived live recordings, originally issued as Rostropovich: The Russian Years. These latter issues are more for specialists including as they do music by composers that won’t suit everybody like Boris Tchaikovsky, Tischenko, Knipper, and Miaskovsky.  This will perhaps limit the attractions of this set to Rostropovich completists. But here is a great deal to delight the general listener also, led by the celebrated recording Rostropovich made with Richter and Oistrakh of Beethoven’s Triple Concerto, with Karajan and the Berliners. There are also two powerful recordings of the Brahms Double with Perlman and Haitink, and with Oistrakh and George Szell from Cleveland.  I also like the Haydn Concertos with Marriner and the Academy. The three DVDs are the complete Bach Cello Suites, filmed 1991, and the Dvorak and Saint Saens concertos filmed with Giulini and the LPO in 1977.

John Suchet plays a track from his featured album at 10.15am every weekday. Born in South Korea and raised in the UK, Min Kym began playing the violin at the age of six. At sixteen she became the youngest ever foundation scholar at the Royal College of Music; at twenty-seven, the first recipient of the Heifetz Prize. The legendary conductor George Solti praised her “exceptional natural talent, mature musicality, and mastery of the violin.”  Min had her Stradivarius stolen at a Pret A Manger sandwich shop in London in 2010 just as her career was about to kick off. The story struck high waves in media, but being traumatised Min could not play anymore. In 2013 the violin was then found under mysterious circumstances…  Min has now written a book about her story, her love to the instrument and what this incident did to her life. This album ties in with the book release, happening in the UK and US. You can download Min's album from Amazon here.    Jane Jones plays a track from her featured album at 6.15pm every weekday.

Classic FM Drive Featured Album, 26 January 2015. For his debut recital album for the Deutsche Grammophon label, the superb Russian pianist Grigory Sokolov presents an outstanding live recording from the Salzburg Festival. For 20 years, the maestro has not allowed his recordings to be released. Up until now the only opportunity to hear him play is at live - sold out - concerts. This recital now released was actually given seven years ago. Here Sokolov offers two piano sonatas in F major by Mozart, played with tremendous virtuosity and conviction but erring towards a free-flowing Romantic interpretation. His Chopin performances here are equally personal - and captivating. As a bonus there are encore pieces from Scriabin, Rameau, and Bach which show off Sokolov's brilliance in all its varied moods.

Her recording of the Sibelius violin concerto even received a fan letter from the composer! She is acclaimed the world over for her distinguished interpretations of the classical violin repertoire and this 2008 recital shows off her versatility - including such showstoppers as the Saint-Saens Introduction et Rondo Capriccioso, the Chaconne from Bach's Partita No.2 for Solo Violin in D Minor, and the whole of Mozart's Sonata for Piano and Violin in B-flat. It is a recording of intensity, musicianship and charm.

With violins divided left and right of the conductor, the subtlety of Berlioz’s scoring makes an indelible impact, leaning more towards the ‘fantastic’ than ‘symphonic’.

John Suchet plays a track from his featured album at 10:15am every weekday. Vox Regis The poetry of Robert Burns will be given a new lease of musical life in a unique recording featuring the University of Aberdeen’s world-renowned composer, Paul Mealor, and its much-celebrated Chamber Choir.  A new album, titled Immortal Memory, will be released under the University’s own record label, VoxRegis, with all proceeds from the sale of the disc donated to support the projects established in Ballater by HRH The Duke of Rothesay and The Dumfries House Trust following the 2016 floods. Professor Mealor said the decision to donate all revenue from sales of the album to the His Royal Highness’s appeal came from strong ties forged with the Deeside community. “The Chamber Choir has performed regularly at events in Royal Deeside, including at celebrations at Balmoral, in Braemar and in Crathie Kirk,” he added. “We have got to know the people of this area through our concerts and they have been a tremendous support to the choir over the years. We thought it would be appropriate to give something back in recognition of that support.” The album was launched at a special concert in the village’s Glenmuick Kirk on Thursday 12th January and was attended by their Royal Highnesses The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.  The concept for the record was developed by Professor Mealor, who has received global acclaim for his work which has been performed at a number of high-profile royal events including the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, when he discovered that few choral arrangements for Robert Burns exist. Immortal Memory follows a traditional Burns Supper and includes many of his favourite works including Auld Lang Syne, Ae Fond Kiss, A Man's a Man and Afton Water.  “Burns is admired the world over for his poetry and songs but despite his enduring popularity, this does not seem to extend into the choral tradition,” he said. “The richness and depth of Burns’ verse lends itself well to choral performance and with the creation of the University’s record label, Vox Regis, it seemed a wonderful opportunity for a new interpretation of his much-loved work.”  The University’s Chamber Choir accompany traditional singer Robert Lovie, who was given the honour of performing the national anthem at the opening of the Glasgow commonwealth games, with fiddle music from Raemond Jappy and soprano Jillian Bain Christie. The Chamber Choir has been invited to perform at a number of high-profile events including the BBC Proms, celebrations for the Queen’s 90th birthday and Songs of Praise.  Buy from Amazon >    John Brunning plays a track from his featured album after 6pm every weekday. Warner Classics  Living as he does between Paris and Los Angeles, pianist Andrew von Oeyen is the ideal interpreter for this enticing programme: flanking Ravel’s Piano Concerto in G with Saint-Saëns’ Piano Concerto No. 2 and Gershwin’s Second Rhapsody, it explores Franco-American cross-currents. Von Oeyen is partnered by the PFK Prague Philharmonia under its Music Director and Chief Conductor Emmanuel Villaume. “Perhaps it is no coincidence that my debut album for Warner Classics presents a Franco-American theme,” says Andrew. An American (of German and Dutch origin) who trained at New York’s Juilliard School, he now lives between Los Angeles and Paris. He is partnered on the album by the PFK Prague Philharmonia under its Music Director and Chief Conductor Emmanuel Villaume – a Frenchman who is very much at home in the USA, as Music Director of the Dallas Opera and as a frequent guest conductor with America’s leading opera companies and orchestras. “I am grateful for the opportunity to live between two continents,” continues Andrew von Oeyen, “and extremely fortunate that my profession allows for this situation. I often say that if someone were to put a gun to my head and make me choose between Europe and America, I would probably get shot! … As a musician of the 21st century, I’d like to think that my passport has little to do with the kind of artist I am; certainly, it doesn’t determine the repertoire I choose to play.” The works he has chosen for this album are Saint-Saëns’ Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor, dating from 1868, Ravel’s Piano Concerto in G, written between 1929 and 1931, and Gershwin’s Second Rhapsody, composed in 1931, seven years after the better-known Rhapsody in Blue. When it came to putting this album together, Ravel was, as von Oeyen explains, “the unifying thread in the programme – he knew both Saint-Saëns and Gershwin.” Saint-Saëns died in 1921 at the age of 86, just at the time Gershwin was achieving huge success. Ravel cited the older composer’s five piano concertos, works full of colour and elegance, as an influence on his G major concerto, but today’s listeners will inevitably be struck by its fusion of characteristic Gallic refinement (epitomised in a central movement of delicate poetry and discreet melancholy) with jazzy bluesiness and angularity. “No music from outside the European Continent would influence Ravel more than American jazz,” says von Oeyen. “In 1928 he even wrote ‘I like jazz far more than grand opera’. His use of jazz in his Concerto in G is probably the most discussed and obvious aspect of the work. But what most impresses me is that the piece doesn’t reflect a classically trained French musician trying to write in the style, thereby diluting, simplifying or mimicking jazz’s core features … Rather it reflects a creator who makes the genre his own, masterfully employing its harmonic and rhythmic idioms and without resorting to cliché. “No French composer was more influenced by the music of Gershwin than Ravel, and probably no American composer was more influenced by the music of Ravel than Gershwin,” continues von Oeyen. The two composers met in Paris in 1926 when Gershwin was on the trip that led to the composition of An American in Paris. In 1928, when Ravel visited the US, he saw Gershwin’s musical Funny Face on Broadway, the two composers visited a jazz club in Harlem and Gershwin played Ravel his Rhapsody in Blue. Andrew von Oeyen recounts the famous anecdote – perhaps apocryphal – of Gershwin’s request to study with Ravel. The Frenchman replied: “Why would you want to be a second-rate Ravel when you are already a first-rate Gershwin? Plus, you make more money than me, so I should take lessons from you!” Ravel’s Concerto in G and Second Rhapsody received their premieres within weeks of each other. While Ravel’s concerto has become one of his best-loved works, Gershwin’s Second Rhapsody has not achieved the phenomenal popularity of Rhapsody in Blue. Andrew von Oeyen finds that hard to explain: “It bears all the qualities of Gershwin’s genius and, in my estimation, at times even surpasses its prototype. Certainly, it deserves to be played more often.” A short piece that is an undoubted favourite completes Andrew von Oeyen’s album. It is an arrangement for piano of the soaring Méditation from the opera Thaïs by Massenet. Here too there is a Franco-American connection. The title role of the opera, first seen in 1894, was written for the charismatic soprano Sybil Sanderson, who was born in California, but enjoyed her greatest successes in Paris.""  Buy from Amazon >   Onyx (2Cds)  This year, its 60 years since the Liverpool Philharmonic got the right to call itself Royal.   And the orchestra celebrates this milestone with this release of recordings they financed themselves in 2015, of three of Tchaikovsky’s symphonies – 3, 4 and 6 – which show the band to be in the finest possible fettle. During his decade with the orchestra, Vasily Petrenko, officially awarded the title of “Honorary Scouser” by Liverpool Council, has shown himself to be a dab hand at a wide range of music, including notable recordings of Elgar’s two symphonies. But it is the Russian repertoire that suits him best.  His recordings of Shostakovich’s symphonies won high praise everywhere.  And now, with this complete Tchaikovsky symphony cycle, Onyx having issued a while ago their recordings of Symphonies 1, 2 and 5, Petrenko returns to an earlier love.  Back in 2009, he won a prestigious Gramophone Award for Best Orchestral Recording of the Year for his account of Tchaikovsky’s unnumbered symphony, Manfred.  This issue could be in line for an award as well.  Because here Petrenko strikes an ideal balance between Russian passion, and western discipline. By which I mean, some of the greatest Russian conductors – men like Yevgeny Mravinsky, who led the Soviet Union’s finest orchestra, the Leningrad Philharmonic, for fifty years, and Yevgeny Svetlanov – made their reputation in Tchaikovsky with high voltage recordings, full of tempi adjustments not greatly favoured in the west. Some thought they pulled the music around too much.  Petrenko loses none of the passion, but his readings are far more straightforward, in the western style. This brings huge benefits, particularly in the Tchaikovsky’s cinderella Symphony, No3, spuriously called the Polish. Petrenko’s account of the first movement makes sense of one of the most difficult symphonic movements to get right, while he also gets right to the heart of the matter in the pivotal slow movement. Obviously Symphony No4, modelled on Beethoven’s 5th, with its Fate motif; and the tragic, Pathétique, first performed only days before Tchaikovsky’s sadly premature death, have attracted dozens of recordings.  I think Petrenko with these readings rises towards the top of the pile, mainly because of his disciplined intensity and clarity in the Pathétique, where he makes sense of the descriptions of each of the four movements found, after his death, amongst Tchaikovsky’s papers: “Life, Love, Disappointment and Death”. Cheerful stuff! But turned into memorable listening by the Merseysiders. I shall be celebrating the 60th anniversary of the granting of the Royal appellation in my programme on February 5th, and the orchestra themselves will be celebrating at a grand concert in Philharmonic Hall on February 18th.  In my programme, as well as playing lots of highlights from the orchestra’s discography, going back to 1943, just a year after the orchestra’s players gained permanent status, I shall also be playing three movements on this new album:  The first movement of No3, the Scherzo of No4, and the finale of the Pathétique.   Hyperion   This Hyperion January issue is a winner at several levels.  The repertoire, the reasonably well known Violin Concerto No2, and the almost totally unknown Konzertstück, In Memoriam, and Adagio Appassionato will fill a gap in most violin lovers collection, and give them a chance to hear Bruch’s output beyond the oh so popular (oh so notorious!) Concerto No 1.  Lieback plays very well, and what emerges is that Bruch should not be described as a one hit wonder.  The In Memoriam is a particularly powerful piece.  No wonder Bruch’s publishers asked him to turn it into a full concerto.  He said he thought it was fine as it is - a massive misjudgement, which has surely all but guaranteed the work’s total neglect in the concert hall.  It is, however, well worth getting to know on disc. Buy from Amazon >  Hyperion   Iestyn Davies is surely the finest counter-tenor around today, and proves the depths of his musicianship with this Bach album, mainly devoted to cantatas Bach would originally have written for male altos, i.e., teenage boys whose voices hadn’t fully broken.  And they must have been accomplished young men to cope with some of the sophisticated solo writing here.  Needless to say Iestyn Davies presents all this stuff better than I can imagine any other counter-tenor doing, and it’s extremely well accompanied by the London based, original instruments orchestra, Arcangelo, under its founder/conductor Jonathan Cohen. The real masterpiece here is of course Ich Habe Genug, originally written for a bass soloist.  And despite all Iestyn Davies’ skills, I remain convinced that a bass voice suits this music best.  However, the ever pragmatic Bach did arrange the piece for both soprano, and for alto, so Davies can’t be blamed for taking it up. This quite well filled disc – 65 minutes – is completed by two orchestral sinfonias, both rearrangements by Bach of music originally to be found in his Brandenburg Concertos.

Classic FM Drive Featured Album, 17 June 2013. Jennifer Whyte has been playing the piano for more than 30 years. She studied Music at Glasgow University and the University of Massachusetts before heading to London to pursue a career in musical theatre.  Jennifer is now an experienced musical director and conductor, who has composed and arranged music for film, television and theatre. She has worked extensively in theatre in the west end and on tour for Cameron Mackintosh, Andrew Lloyd Webber and the Royal National Theatre. Most recently, she played for the filming of the movie of Les Misérables and was associate musical director for The Magistrate at the Royal National Theatre. Composing has always been her passion though, and this album represents a long-held ambition to record some of her pieces for piano and chamber ensemble.  'I chose the album title ‘Stories’ not only to reflect the fact that each of the pieces tells a story or has a story behind it, but also because of recurring comments from people who hear my music that it conjures stories in their mind,' says Jennifer. 'There is no definitive story to each piece – only the story it tells you when you listen to it.'

166,classicfm.com/discover-music/,classical,https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/album-reviews/jubilate-mendelssohn/," 20 March 2017, 10:00 | Updated: 15 June 2017, 15:21  Throughout the week Classic FM’s presenters bring you the best new recordings, including world exclusives and premiere broadcasts of latest releases.  John Suchet plays a track from his featured album at 10:15am every weekday. Album of the Week this week is Classic FM's very own 'Jubilate', a sensational album celebrating 500 years of Cathedral Music. Led by the world-renowned St Paul’s Cathedral Choir, this album features a host of famous choral music spanning five centuries – from Thomas Tallis’ Salvator Mundi to Paul Mealor’s Ubi Caritas, with Handel, Mendelssohn, Vaughan Williams and more between. Not only does this album boast the great choral music of the last 500 years, it also showcases the incredible talent of our young choristers today. St Paul’s Cathedral Choir has joined forces with 50 young choristers from cathedrals across the UK (one representative for each of the UK’s cathedral choirs) for four tracks on the album. The amassed voices can be heard in glorious sound on Handel’s Zadok The Priest, Parry’s I Was Glad and Rutter’s A Gaelic Blessing. This cathedral 'super-group' is directed by Andrew Carwood and includes special solos from Aled Jones and St Paul’s 2016 Head Chorister Nathaniel Morley singing ‘O for the Wings of a Dove’ in this new recording of a work that is reputed to have sold over 5 million copies in a recording by chorister Ernest Lough in the early 20th century. Every copy of the album sold will raise money for the ‘Diamond Fund for Choristers’ which aims to help young choral singers and secure the future of cathedral music. It is supported by Classic FM presenter Alexander Armstrong – also a former choirboy himself – who hails becoming a chorister as ""the greatest leg-up a child can be given in life"".   John Brunning plays a track from his featured album after 6pm every weekday.  Mendelssohn's warmly lyrical and evocative Scottish symphony is paired with his confident and precocious first symphony for the first in a series of recordings in multi-channel surround sound for Pentatone by the conductor Andrew Manze and the NDR Radiophilharmonie.Inspired by his visits to Scotland and the Hebrides and the romantic novels of Sir Walter Scott, his outstanding Symphony No. 3 in A minor (Scottish) is a colourful reminiscence of its rugged landscapes steeped in history, and an affectionate homage to the proud Highlanders he met there. It was an instant success on its first performance and rivals the popularity of the overture The Hebrides, also inspired by the splendour of Scotland.No less impressive is his masterly Symphony No. 1 in C minor, composed when he was just 15 years old. From its noisy and impetuous opening to its triumphant conclusion, this confident and adventurous work shows the influence of Mozart, Haydn and Weber but the effect is unmistakeably Mendelssohnian with fugal passages, unforgettable melodies and busy, inventive scoring.The exceptional Andrew Manze delivers wonderfully delicate strings, spotless, yet warm-sounding woodwind, and the result is detailed and rich in contrast. Renowned for his boundless energy, scholarly knowledge and with many critically acclaimed recordings in a broad repertoire, Manze is celebrated as one of the most stimulating and inspirational conductors of his generation.     Hyperion  Marc-André Hamelin, presents a vivid picture of Rachmaninov’s Third, where he is greatly helped by an energised LPO under their Music Director, Vladimir Jurowski. Here the music rattles along under the fingers of a man who completely understands Rachmaninov’s idiom. The recording is well balanced, and the coupling intelligent; the Second Concerto of Rachmaninov’s lifelong friend Nikolai Medtner. Sadly, Medtner lacked Rachmaninov’s melodic inspiration, but this underrated concerto still repays attention.  The piano and orchestra are well integrated in Hyperion’s typically excellent recording.  The duration, 82 minutes, is exceptionally generous.     Hyperion  This well established duo, consisting of two quite exceptional players, continue their journey through Mozart’s Piano Sonatas on this 2CD set, where a full range of music is offered from two very early ones, K27 and K31, to three of full maturity, including the Sonata in F Major K547. They span more than 20 years of Mozart’s creative output, (1766-1788) and K547 was the last Violin Sonata he completed. The Violin Sonatas are not the obvious place to begin when seeking to appreciate Mozart’s greatness.  But, in what is volume three of a complete survey of Mozart’s Piano Sonatas, the Tiberghien/Ibragimova duo play with typical understanding, and Hyperion’s recording, from May 2015 is first class.   Naxos  It’s so easy to take Naxos for granted, but we shouldn’t.  This is a typically compelling issue, where three Scandinavian pieces from 1881-1911 are beautifully played by the Scandinavian virtuoso Henning Kraggerud, attentively accompanied by the Malmö Symphony Orchestra under Bjarte Engeset.  The recordings, made in Malmö last September, are full bodied, and well balanced.  This disc will give much pleasure at its inexpensive price, even though in truth, only the tiny Romance by Johan Svendsen is an undeniable masterpiece.  A real little gem, with a great tune.   The Dane Carl Nielsen is an almost exact contemporary of Sibelius, but may be the nearly man of Scandinavian music. He produced a full range of music, with symphonies and concertos that have a considerable following, but for which special pleading is always needed, since they don’t have the immediate impact that Sibelius does.  His Violin Concerto from 1911 is a sophisticated piece, modernist in its way, with many pre-echoes of masters to come, especially Prokofiev.  Sadly however its lack of melodic distinction, and real rhythmic drive and grip, means it cannot be mentioned in the same breath as the Sibelius Concerto. It is nevertheless is well worth hearing. The novelty here is Johan Halvorsen’s Concerto, of which this is the first commercial recording. Halvorsen was the natural successor to Grieg, and this concerto has many touches worthy of the older master, like the finale, full of rhythms from the Norwegian folk dance, the Halling.   It was premiered in 1909, but never heard again in Halvorsen’s lifetime.  It is thought he destroyed the score when he retired in 1929. Happily it was found amongst the papers of the soloist, and now we can discover it for ourselves. Its 21 minutes long, and no masterpiece, but pleasant enough in its way.

Silver Bow sees Katherine Bryan, the principal flautist with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, offering a refreshing view of some much-loved works, originally written for violin. Most unusually is the flute version of the Classic FM Hall of Fame No.1 - Vaughan Williams’s The Lark Ascending. The lark here doesn’t so much soar through the air but warble on a branch, but it’s a surprisingly successful arrangement. There are also dazzling showpieces from Saint-Saëns and Sarasate plus Paganini's 24th Caprice which, we are reliably informed, features flutter tongueing and pop tongueing. Bryan plays with a beautiful tone, showcased to particular effect on works such as Kreisler's Liebesleid and Massenet's Meditation from Thaïs.   ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202125.41/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319183735-20190319205735-00196.warc.gz
168,classicfm.com/discover-music/,classical,https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/album-reviews/khatia-buniatishvili-motherland/," An intimate album of solo piano works from Bach to Arvo Pärt. Classic FM Drive Featured Album, 2 June 2014. Described as 'the young Georgian firebrand', Khatia Buniatishvili is a thrillingly talented pianist who blends technical brilliance with a uniquely sorrowful sound which is heavily influenced by the Georgian folk-music she grew up with. This album came in at No.13 in Classic FM's Album of the Year 2014. See the full chart here >'The piano is the blackest instrument,' she has said, a 'symbol of musical solitude…' And that's very apparent on her new album, following on from a critically acclaimed Chopin recording, which shows off this highly personal approach with solo piano works, ranging from Bach to Arvo Pärt, in which the themes of longing for home, folk dance and the eternal cycle of growth and decay are explored.  Spanning a broad stylistic and historical range, including pieces from Georgia itself, Motherland juxtaposes the happy lightness of a ‘Slavonic Dance’ by Dvorak with the graceful introspection of Liszt’s ‘Lullaby’. Throughout them all, Buniatishvili plays with her characteristic grace, sensitivity and beauty.   ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912206677.94/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326220507-20190327002507-00018.warc.gz

John Suchet plays a track from his featured album at 10:15am every weekday. Altus Records  British composer and conductor Richard Harvey is a BAFTA award winner, a respected orchestral conductor and a virtuoso performer on a wide range of Western and exotic instruments.  Richard has written several large-scale choral works, including his Te Deum, a complex Magnificat and the popular Kyrie for the Magdalene that formed a highlight of the music for the film of The Da Vinci Code: 'Hans Zimmer asked me to compose this for the scene in “The Da Vinci Code” when Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou enter Westminster Abbey looking for an important clue, but are initially overwhelmed by the majesty and spirituality of the great space. Once I started writing I felt compelled to finish the piece! Listen out for the soaring solo performance from Estonian Soprano Tui Hirv.' The album features orchestral performances by members of the Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra and Sinfonietta Riga.   John Brunning plays a track from his featured album after 6pm every weekday. Sony Classical  The fifth album release from Francesco Grillo is a very exciting one, best described by the artist himself: 'It is said that man began to sing through a desire to emulate the birdsong he heard. Indeed, the voice is probably one of the primeval instruments with which nature endowed us. I would like to underline, here, the way in which man has always taken inspiration from nature in his artistic creation in an attempt to fulfil a spiritual need. Over the centuries, indeed, great composers such as Liszt, Strauss, Berlioz, Saint-Saëns, Debussy, Ravel and Beethoven himself - the Pastoral Symphony immediately comes to mind - have left us an unforgettable legacy of what is known as ""programme music"", in other words music inspired by other art forms such a literature and painting but also by nature itself. It is clear, therefore, that narrative and description have always been an important element of music. Against this backdrop, The Four Seasons by Antonio Vivaldi assume iconographic status. Indeed, this composer's ability to express birdsong or the wind through leafy tree branches using trills and mordents - as he does in Spring - is astonishing.' Fransesco also found process of transcribing the score a remarkable experience: 'This marvellous work, to my great surprise, naturally lent itself to arrangement for a percussion instrument like the piano. Like so many others, I have known this world-famous since childhood, yet in-depth examination enabled me to appreciate still further its descriptive value, whose modernity transcends time in its use of harmony, melody and musical poetry with typically Italian inventiveness and measure. During both transcription and performance of the work, I sought to reproduce those sonorous ""touches"" that would enable me to maintain the element of dialogue between soloist and orchestra, albeit produced by the same instrument.' Francesco Grillo is a classical pianist and composer who studied at the Milan Conservatory and went on to the Academies of Imola and Cremona. From a family with deep-rooted musical traditions, Francesco began composing as a child, his early models being the great Romantics (Chopin and Liszt), followed by the great composers of Russia (Rachmaninov, Scriabin and Prokofiev) and France (Ravel, first and foremost).  His passion for Jazz and, in particular, great pianists such as Bill Evans and Bud Powell, led him to develop his own, very personal, composition style which draws from both traditions, Classical and Jazz, in an effective combination of two seemingly distant worlds.  Francesco has performed in many European countries as well as the United States, Japan and Mexico and taken part in the opening ceremony of the European figure skating championships in Milan (broadcast live throughout Europe), playing his preludes which were then included in his first album of his own compositions.  Chandos  This extremely well performed and recorded, 77 minute Chandos album, allows the adventurous to discover two of RVW’s more interesting works. Neither are crowd pleasers, like the Lark Ascending or the Tallis Fantasia, but both have satisfying lyrical passages, containing some fine melodies.  And both reward a bit of effort.  The ballet, Job, was created in 1927, but wasn’t a success. Much of the music is however excellent.  And some parts are very beautiful, such as Elihu’s Dance of Youth and Beauty, which is very reminiscent of the Lark. The sleeve note here details the complicated plot, and gives all the information needed to make this a most enjoyable listen. When RVW composed his jolly, lightweight Symphony No8, three years before he died, everyone thought that was it.  But in his final months, he produced a Ninth Symphony, based on his lifelong obsession with Thomas Hardy’s Tess of the D’Urbervilles. This 33 minute symphony is well worth discovering, and shows what an extraordinary musician RVW was, keeping his creativity and his inspiration going until the very end. Warner Classic  The Polish pianist Piotr Anderszewski produces some of the finest of today’s albums of piano music.  It’s surprising therefore he isn’t better known or appreciated.  Maybe it’s because he is interested in ideas, and rare or difficult repertoire, rather than crowd pleasers.  This album, entitled Fantasies is typical of him.  He combines a little known Mozart fantasy, with an exhilarating performance of arguably Schumann’s finest piano piece, the Fantasia in C minor.  The two substantial makeweights, are Mozart’s little known and rather serious Piano Sonata, No14, with a slow movement of real depth, and a rather tragic Theme and Variation composed by Schumann as he was about to enter the lunatic asylum, where he ended his life. Erato  David Fray, the French pianist, has made some excellent recordings, primarily of Bach. And in this recital of nocturnes, and associated pieces, his playing, full of calm and often mesmeric assurance, recalls the way he interprets JSB.   There is no romantic excess. The liner note writer correctly points to Chopin’s admiration for Bach – unusual in those times – and this first class album makes that enthusiasm clear. On another week, this would be an Album of the Week.  Fray is potentially a very major pianist.

Pixis' Piano Concerto in C major is by no means out-of-the-ordinary, but its triumphant trumpet chords in the first movement and shimmering strings in the second are waiting to be discovered. A delightful addition comes in the form of the third movement's bright high piano accompanied by meaty plucked strings in the orchestra. The Piano Concertino shows off the composer's sensitive side with prominent clarinet, oboe, and flute tunes in the first movement, and long flowing piano scales in the second.Thalberg's addition to the album comes in the form of his Piano Concerto in F minor.

Tchakovsky wrote most of his Symphony No. 4 in the midst of an emotional crisis. The work is dominated by the idea of Fate, which Tchaikovsky said ‘hangs above your head like the sword of Damocles, and unwaveringly, constantly poisons the soul’. From the intensity of the first movement, to the melancholic second, and the redemption of the triumphant finale, the London Philharmonic Orchestra and conductor Vladimir Jurowski capture the emotions running deep within the music.

With its high drama, rapturous love duets and huge ensembles, it’s a piece on a grand scale and Botstein does it full justice. Bullock is tremendous as Genièvre, powerful yet vulnerable, O’Neill makes a shiningly heroic tenor sound as Lancelot, and the BBC SO sounds on top form.

A French Baroque ensemble meets the Fab Four in an unusual new recording.  Classic FM Drive Featured Album, 10 June 2013. Surprising though it may seem, it was during a session in which the French-Canadian Baroque ensemble Les Boréades were recording 17th-century Italian music that the idea of Beatles Baroque was born. They started improvising some famous Beatles songs and, before long, an entire album had been created.Fifteen of the Beatles' biggest hits - including Yesterday, The Long and Winding Road and All You Need Is Love - are here given the Baroque makeover. In theory it sounds like a recipe for disaster but it surprisingly works rather well. What d'you think of this week's Featured Album? 'Baroque and roll' or just plain wrong?

Composer: Chausson  Repertoire: Poèmes de l’amour  Artists: Susan Graham, BBC SO/Yan Pascal TortelierRating: 5/5 Genre: Vocal Label: Warner 2564 61938-2 It is very easy to lose oneself in sheer Gallic gorgeousness here. Chausson’s Poème  de l’amour et de la mer is one of this underrated composer’s finest works: more than a song, slightly less than a song cycle, it’s  a fervid evocation of overheated lost love clothed in the darkest, silkiest, most refined melodies and textures. In Graham’s richly thought-out interpretation, you can almost smell the lilac blossom that fragrances the poem; her nuancing of the text by the Symbolist poet Maurice Bouchor is more than exemplary. Chausson’s music forms a marvellous contrast with the sharper-edged exoticism of Ravel’s Shéhérazade; and John Adams’s sensitive orchestration of Debussy’s Baudelaire songs brings these sensual settings into highly-polished, technicolour relief. It’s fascinating to hear what a contemporary master of orchestration like Adams makes of Debussy’s piano-oriented half-lights; the result manages to be faithful to the spirit of Debussy while also casting the music in a more up-to-the-minute light, with crystalline clarity and extra sprinklings of glitter when appropriate. Graham sings with a rounded, clear, open tone that can soar in unbridled ecstasy while always remaining precise and well defined. The orchestral accompaniment is warm and sympathetic.   ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204086.87/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325174034-20190325200034-00140.warc.gz

John Suchet plays a track from his featured album at 10:15am every weekday. Continuing his award-winning cycle, Sir John Eliot Gardiner leads the London Symphony Orchestra, his Monteverdi Choir and three talented young actors from the Guildhall School in a landmark performance of Mendelssohn’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, which was performed as part of the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death. To mark the celebrations, Gardiner produced a special version of the work featuring some cuts to the original movements that, in his words, ""[remove] all of the music relating to the Mechanicals and thus focusing on the world of the fairies and the human lovers."" Mendelssohn, who adored Shakespeare’s writings, composed his concert overture based on A Midsummer Night’s Dream in 1827 at the young age of 17. Music scholar George Grove described it as ""the greatest marvel of early maturity that the world has ever seen in music"".  John Brunning plays a track from his featured album after 6pm every weekday.   Sony           I first heard Sonya Yoncheva at Plácido Domingo’s 2011 Operalia Gala at Covent Garden, and was mightily impressed. An impression confirmed by her first Sony album - some cleverly chosen French stuff - and particularly by her appearance at Covent Garden last autumn as Norma.  Yoncheva bravely took on the role after Anna Netrebko precipitately pulled out, and had a considerable success with a part you would not have expected her to have taken on whilst so young. Now she proves her versatility with this Handel CD with ten Handel arias and duets, and an encore, Purcell’s When I Am Laid In Earth from Dido and Aeneas. Her vocal resources and musicianship are well able to handle this transition to baroque material far better than another young soprano rival, Pumeza, who made a serious mess in her recent CD of the Purcell piece. Yoncheva uses discreet decoration – maybe too discreet for some Handel specialists – but for me this is excellent listening.  Highly recommended.  Aida Garifullina won the 2013 Operalia competition, and on the basis of this excellent debut disc has a great future ahead of her. Decca are good at spotting vocal talent, and then, when the recordings succeed, keeping the singers on their books long term.  Think of Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pavarotti, both of whom were Decca artists for more than 40 years.  Equally though, some fall by the wayside, but I hope this will not happen to Aida Garifullina, whose debut disc is an alluring combination of well known arias, combined with Russian stuff that only specialists in late 19th century Russian music will know. The arias by Gounod and Delibes go well, whilst in the arias from her homeland, she is even more persuasive.  There’s some lovely stuff like the Snow Maiden’s aria from Rimsky Korsakov’s opera, and Maria’s Lullaby from Tchaikovsky’s Mazeppa, that are almost unknown over here.  This excellent CD ends with an old favourite of mine, Midnight in Moscow, with the backing of a balalaika ensemble.  This is well worth getting/downloading if you are a canary fancier who wants appealing romantic music a bit off the beaten track.  My third soprano of the week, the veteran Natalie Dessay, comes up with a double album way too eccentric to be recommendable, though it does have its moments. CD1 is music from the Great American Songbook like On A Clear Day; Send In The Clowns; and There’s No Business Like Show Business. Here she sings surprisingly idiomatically, accompanied by the Paris Mozart Orchestra under Claire Gibault. But then, I suspect Gibault leads her astray when on CD2 Dessay doesn’t sing, but is a narrator of difficult orchestral music composed by Graciane Finzi inspired by the paintings of Edward Hopper. Sony’s brochure has lots of well reproduced Hopper paintings, and they are indeed attractive to look at.  However, what we really need is the text/translations of Dessay’s narrations, and we don’t get them. Hopeless. One day, they should just release CD1 by itself.  I haven’t checked, maybe you can download just CD1.  If you can, do.

The Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto is one of the best-loved classical compositions in China, as well as being the one Chinese work that is probably most often heard in Western concert halls. In the piece’s homeland, the solo part is often transcribed for a traditional stringed instrument but here it's the orchestral part that has been arranged for Chinese traditional orchestra, instead. The album is the sixth in a series which features Western solo instruments against the thrilling soundscapes of the Chinese traditional orchestra. On first listening, the concerto appears technically to be not very demanding - but it does require the soloist to navigate awkward chords and fingerings and keep the intonation perfectly level. The eminent violinist Lu Siqing is no stranger to the piece, having performed it all over the world, and he gives it a beautiful rendition here – on a Western violin, with the support of the Taipei Chinese Orchestra conducted by Chung Yiu-Kwong. Lu Siqing is equally proficient on the other pieces collected on the album – by such Western luminaries as Sarasate, Kreisler and Tchaikovsky –whose works have never sounded quite like they do here.   ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203842.71/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325072024-20190325094024-00442.warc.gz

Buy from Amazon > Buy from iTunes >  DG/Decca (200 CDs) 4 stars  Did you know Mozart once proposed marriage to Marie Antoinette? He was 6 at the time, and they probably ate cake. But nothing came of it. Nor did his attempt, aged 7, to kiss Madame Pompadour at Versailles. She refused to let him, even though, one suspects, she wasn’t always that choosy. And you never see Mozart’s left ear in portraits. Was it mangled, or what?  Just a couple of fun facts that make this extraordinary DG/Decca box so endlessly fascinating. Not only do you get everything Mozart composed, including a song only discovered last year – 240 hours of music on 200 CDs – but also a new biography, and the new edition of the Koechel catalogue, that tries to lists all Mozart’s compositions in date order.  The 225th anniversary of Mozart’s death falls in four weeks time, and if it’s not a good excuse for a party, at least it’s a valid reason for this new box, which will set you back around £300. In one sense, a lot of money, in another though, very little, when you think each CD costs only £1.50, and there’s a lifetime of listening pleasure to be found here.  DG/Decca’s last complete Mozart set was produced for the bicentenary in 1991. 70% of these recordings are different, because a radical, and some may think, controversial, view has been taken. The tendency in this box is, wherever possible, to choose original instrument performances. A lot of famous recordings using modern orchestras, even though they feature some of the greatest artists of the last 100 years, have been marginalised into a 30CD ancillary collection.    So, for instance, for the Piano Concertos, you get Robert Levin and Malcolm Bilson, playing fortepianos, which are frankly, a bit of an acquired taste. They sound far too shallow in this great music for my taste, whether or not it was what Mozart was used to. When you think DG/Decca have complete sets by outstanding pianists such as the pioneering one by Géza Anda; Daniel Barenboim; Vladimir Ashkenazy; Andras Schiff; Mitsuko Uchida etc etc; plus significant recordings of individual concertos by Maurizio Pollini and Clifford Curzon, it’s not, frankly, a decision I particularly agree with.  The same is true of the symphonies, whilst some of the complete opera choices will also raise eyebrows. Perhaps complete alternative modern instrument performances should have been included, at least of the symphonies and concertos. Would it have made that much difference if the box had run to 225 CDs for the 225th anniversary, rather than, 200, as here? Anyway, enough carping. This is a magnificent undertaking, and a brave commercial decision, when the classical CD business faces such problems. It’s beautifully packaged and very heavy. You need a bodybuilding course, (not included in the price!) to hump it around. Real magic here, though not perhaps quite as magical as it could have been. Buy now from Amazon >  Decca  This is the fifth and final instalment of a Grammy Award-winning series of Mozart Piano Concertos where Dame Mitsuko Uchida takes the solo part, and directs a slimmed down Cleveland Orchestra. For me, this last one is the best, because of the alertness of her playing, the excellent contribution of the orchestra, with some especially eloquent woodwind, and the pairing, which brings together two contrasting concertos, both of which show Mozart’s creativity at its highest level.  No.17 with its opera buffa finale, is full of good tunes, and is lightweight listening of the highest order. No.25 is of a very different order, with one of the weightiest opening movements of any Mozart concerto (its only rivals being No.18, and No.20), which have Mozart operating in Beethovenian style providing propulsion and power that points ahead to the kind of Mozart we might have heard had he lived a fuller span. Listening to these performances, which are always easy on the ear, even when making tough-minded statements as in No.25, does make me think once again that the editors of the anniversary box really did make an error in not having all the Mozart concerto performances played by artists of Uchida’s stature, relegating the fortepiano gang to supplementary CDs, rather than the other way around.  Buy from Amazon > Buy from iTunes > Sony   Regula Mühlemann makes an impressive debut in this absorbing album devoted in the main to arias that Mozart composed for named sopranos, including two of his sisters in-law, all expertly described in an impeccable and fascinating liner note – a model of its kind – by Dr Karl Böhmer. So what you get are arias from five of Mozart’s operas, usually little known like Lucio Silla, as well as arias designed for a particular singer to interpolate into another composers opera.  Two of these are especially fine, namely “Vorrei Spiegarvi, oh Dio” written for his sister in-law Aloysia Lange, and “Schon Lacht der Holde Frühling” composed for his other sister in-law Josepha Hofer, who wanted it liven up Paisiello’s boring take on the Barber of Seville. I knew neither of these two arias, and really enjoyed them, and will be playing them on my show on December 11th. This album is completed by the well known motet “Exsultate Jubilate”, which Dr Böhmer advises was originally composed for a castrato.  Didn’t know that. Please consider this album for purchase or download, even though it is a bit short weight at 54 minutes, because it’s full of good listening, with some great information attached.  The Basel Chamber Orchestra under Umberto Benedetti Michelangeli also make a fine contribution here, with some delightful woodwind playing, as by the unnamed principal oboe in “Vorrei Spiegarvi”.

His choir perform heroically, and there is a fine team of soloists, led by our own Carolyn Sampson, who sounds truly radiant in my favourite bit of this neglected work, Et Incarnatus Est. Buy from Amazon > Warner Classics 35CDs Anyone who is in any doubt that Daniel Barenboim is one of the greatest musicians of our time, won’t be, after listening to this thrilling set. It’s impossible to think of another musician in our time, who could perform so authoritatively almost all of Beethoven’s piano music, as well as conducting exceptional performances of the Symphonies, the Missa Solemnis and Fidelio. This 35CD set was recorded over a period of more than 30 years (1966-1999), and comprises both studio and live recordings. It’s a snip at £60 or less. In some of the chamber music, Barenboim is joined by his late wife Jacqueline Du Pré, and in the Violin Concerto by Itzhak Perlman. In the triple concerto, the other soloists are Yo-Yo Ma, and Pinchas Zukerman. Obviously, not every performance is best in class, but overall this is a magnificent collection.  Buy from Amazon > Deutsche Grammophon  Nemanja Radulović is a Nigel Kennedy lookalike, though hopefully not so eccentric as Nigel, and has a dazzling technique working with an exceptional group of musicians on this Bach album.  I greeted its predecessor, bits and pieces of Slavonic music with great warmth in a comment they used on the cover of this new CD, calling Nemanja an “exceptional talent with real charisma and serious youth appeal”. Anyway, this collection consists of two violin concertos by JS Bach, arrangements of stuff like the Toccata and Fugue, the Air on a G String, and the Chaconne, plus a reconstructed concerto by one of Bach’s sons, JC, known as the London Bach, because he spent most of his career over here. In some of the outer movements of the concertos the orchestra sound a bit too abrasive, but don’t let that put you off. Nemanja is dazzling – a really serious, and exciting musician. Buy from Amazon > Onyx James Ehnes is an exceptional virtuoso violinist, whose artistry is always put at the service of the composer and his music, rather than confined to showpieces designed to display his own technique. Ehnes built up a formidable discography for leading commercial labels, and latterly for the artist-led Onyx label, so in effect, he records himself.  This one, with his own quartet, consists of arguably Schubert’s greatest quartet, “Death and the Maiden”, which, although composed when Schubert was 24, seven years before his death, is doom laden, because it comes at the point when he knew he had syphilis, and that it would kill him. Which reads across well into Sibelius’s Quartet “Intimate Voices”, written while Sibelius was himself under the shadow of death, having to endure 13 operations for a tumour in his throat. These recordings, made last year at Potton Hall in Suffolk, sound really well, and the performances are first class. Buy from Amazon > Sony This is, at first sight, a curiosity, because the first part of the Christmas Oratorio comes from recordings made in Berlin in 2011 under Karl-Friedrich Beringer, and the second part has the same forces recorded four years later under Martin Lehmann. Not so curious though when we factor in that Bach’s Christmas Oratorio is actually six cantatas, put together for performance on six key dates over the Christmas/New Year 1734-35. In effect, then, the Christmas Oratorio is six works, though there are of course links between them. On that basis, this is a perfectly acceptable recording, and it’s good to have a new one of a great work, made all the more compelling by its price - £12.50 or less for two well-filled CDs.  The performances are extremely capable, and well recorded.  Not as distinguished as some you will find in the catalogue perhaps, but a good buy nonetheless.

John Suchet plays a track from his featured Album of the Week at 10.15am every weekday. You can buy your own copy from the Classic FM store here. Pentatone Mozart's Symphony No. 40 and No. 41 encapsulate him as a master at work in his finest hour. They were acknowledged as masterpieces upon their first reception and the symphonies still continue to sweep audiences off their feet today. In this new recording, Andrew Manze conducts the NDR Radiophilharmonie at a live performance. The Symphony No. 40's famous opening that cuts right to the chase plunges you into a rich hour and a half of music. The pair of symphonies are easily digestible in succession, especially with this bright interpretation of the music. In these works, Mozart displays his vivid melodic invention, as well as melodic complexities we could only dream of writing ourselves. This is worth a listen, simply for the pleasure of enjoying his sublime final symphonies. John Brunning plays a track from his featured Drive Discovery at 6.15pm every weekday. Nonesuch Records Pianist Jeremy Denk presents a two-disc album of works spanning seven centuries in his latest release c.1300-c.2000. The performances have been taken from Denk's live concerts, including recordings from Lincoln Centre, Wigmore Hall and Piano aux Jacobins. Denk said: “The history of so-called classical music felt closer to me now than it did when I first learned about it in college, not just more relevant, but more alive. Wouldn't it be amazing, I wondered, to experience this sweep and arc in one sitting?” The album comprises 24 pieces covering 700 years of musical evolution from composers Machaut to Ligeti, with Stockhausen, Philip Glass and others in between. This recording is a fascinating discovery of piano music old and new. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202299.16/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320044358-20190320070358-00381.warc.gz

Album of the Weekend, 10-11 May 2014. Myung Whun Chung is one of the world's most in-demand conductors, who has recorded scores of very fine albums from the podium. But for this new release, he takes his seat at the keyboard for his very first recording of solo piano music.Actually, Chung was originally a pianist. He made his debut with the Seoul Philharmonic at the age of seven. In 1974 he was a prize winner in the Tchaikovsky Competition and then began his career playing piano trios with his sisters, Kyung Wha Chung and Myung Wha Chung. Recorded at Venice's Teatro La Fenice in July 2013, Chung has dedicated this album to younger listeners and has filled it with familiar, well-loved pieces - Debussy's Clair de lune, two Chopin Nocturnes and a pair of Schubert Impromptus, Beethoven's Für Elise, Schumann's Träumerei and Arabeske, Tchaikovsky, and Mozart.  The pieces are all beautifully played and arranged in a gently flowing sequence which also serves to highlight affinities between the compositions.    ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202496.35/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321051516-20190321073516-00300.warc.gz

Classic FM Drive Featured Album, 18 August 2014. To celebrate the Brazilian pianist Nelson Freire’s 70th Birthday this year, Decca have brought together this special double CD collection which presents concerto repertoire taken from high quality radio broadcasts that have not been available up until now on record. Mined from the archives of radio stations in France, Germany and the Netherlands, these concertos present Freire's career in Europe during his 20s and early 30s, a time when he was described by the press as a ""young lion of the keyboard"". Freire is not the most prolific of recording artists and his live performances are also rare so these outstandingly remastered recordings, conveying his dazzling technique and superb interpretative powers, are to be treasured.  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202450.86/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320190324-20190320212324-00086.warc.gz

John Suchet plays a track from his featured Album of the Week at 10.15am every weekday. Harmonia Mundi This is the next instalment in Isabelle Faust’s Bach recording adventure that began nine years ago. Her recording of Bach’s Sonatas and Partitas are still regarded as some of the finest out there. The three monumental concertos on this album are impeccably recorded by Faust, Bernhard Forck and the Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin. It is easily forgotten that Bach was not only a great composer but a virtuoso violinist – and these challenging works are no easy feat for the most talented of musicians. Faust, however, makes it sound effortless. John Brunning plays a track from his featured Drive Discovery at 6.15pm every weekday. Naxos This album of modern works brings together solo piano pieces and chamber works written by composer Tamara Konstantin. We are treated not only to Konstantin at the piano, but also a cello sonata by Jiaxin Lloyd Webber, a number pieces performed by violinist Yu-Mien Sun and two piano sonatas with Marc Verter at the keyboard. The entire album is a collection of miniatures, with nothing lasting much more than four minutes. Many pieces are inspired by Konstantin's countryside home by the sea, and this is elegantly reflected in the relaxing music. Other pieces, such as the Piano Sonata No. 3, are busier and have a strong direction. They are an enjoyable contrast to the more subdued tracks on the album.

     Throughout the week Classic FM’s presenters bring you the best new recordings, including world exclusives and premiere broadcasts of latest releases. John Suchet plays a track from his featured Album of the Week at 10.15am every weekday. LSO Bernard Haitink celebrates his 90th birthday this week, and so we nod to the great conductor with a magnificent recording of his. Here, he conducts Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 2, Triple Concerto and Leonore Overture with the London Symphony Orchestra. Maria João Pires takes centre stage in the piano concerto and doesn't miss a beat – with Haitink at the helm it isn't hard to see why. The Triple Concerto for Piano, Violin and Cello is also brilliantly played by Lars Vogt, Tim Hugh and Gordan Nikolitch. John Brunning plays a track from his featured Drive Discovery at 6.15pm every weekday. Deutsche Grammophon This album brings together two formidable musical forces – Andreas Ottensamer on the clarinet, and Yuja Wang on piano. The Berlin Philharmonic also feature on the album under the direction of Mariss Jansons. Ottensamer plays a selection of Brahms, Mendelssohn and Weber, with a number of unexpected pieces making an appearance as arrangements for the clarinet on the album. One of these, and a particular album highlight, is Mendelssohn's ‘Lieder ohne Worte’ (‘Songs without words’), which Ottensamer arranged himself for clarinet and piano. Yuja Wang's piano performance is unsurprisingly effortless and is a joy to listen to, too.
