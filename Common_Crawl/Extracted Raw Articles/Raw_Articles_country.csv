Paul Brandt (featuring Lindsay Ell), ""Bittersweet""
Backed by guitar hero (and fellow Calgary native) Lindsay Ell, singer-songwriter Paul Brandt shines a light on life's great balancing act with ""Bittersweet."" The song celebrates the ups, downs and in-betweens of our everyday existence, with plenty of anthemic, arena-ready atmospherics from Ell's Fender.

Flatland Cavalry, ""Honeywine""
Like the Turnpike Troubadours, Flatland Calvary mix Red Dirt roots-rock with fiddle-driven twang. The blend is particularly intoxicating on this amplified love song, which finds frontman Cleto Cordero singing the praises of a woman who's sweeter than mead. Songwriter Kaitlin Butts makes an appearance, too, serving as harmony partner and overall muse to her bandleader beau.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R096sVIrlqg

Cassadee Pope, ""One More Red Light""
Pope begs her guy to take the long way home, measuring their time together by the number of passing street signs. Mandolins and acoustic guitars fill the song's intro, but the arrangement expands and electrifies as ""One More Red Light"" speeds along, eventually peaking with an open-armed, lighter-hoisting chorus whose pop-rock punch recalls Pope's best work with the Warped Tour-approved Hey Monday.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhnWrYOm34

The Last Bandoleros, ""What Would You Be Doing""
Mixing Flamenco guitars, Tex-Mex twang and country-pop gloss into the same globetrotting song, ""What Would You Be Doing?"" pays tribute to Emilio, the Tejano star whose death left his two sons — Diego and Emilio Navaira IV — without a mentor. As the rhythm section of the Last Bandoleros, the Navaira siblings provide the rhythmic backbone for a song that's heartfelt and bittersweet, aimed at mourning — and memorializing — a man whose musical influence reached far beyond his inner circle.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyj9FkD3z_Q

Carson McHone, ""Sad""
Years after fronting the Thursday night house band at Austin's White Horse saloon, Carson McHone nods to her honky-tonk past — and pushes beyond it — with the upcoming Carousel. It's a coming-of-age album produced by Mike McCarthy, the same man who oversaw more than half of Spoon's catalog. The result is an LP that ignores the rules of traditional country music, with ""Sad"" — the lead-off track, driven along by fiddle and electric guitar — gleefully speeding up and slowing down at its own pace. Filled with self-aware lyrics about McHone's history of heartbreak, this is the sound of an artist making peace with her own unrest.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=att_xkfmzi0

Aaron Lee Tasjan, ""Heart Slows Down""
American heartland rock gets a British Invasion makeover with this power-pop gem. ""Honey, if your heart slows down, I will always be around,"" Tasjan reassures, soothing a worried lover's mind over stacked harmonies and psychedelic guitar riffs. Woozily weird one minute and strikingly melodic the next, this stoned song is equal parts Full Moon Fever and Fountains of Wayne's mid-Nineties debut.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ceVr8SRhws

Randy Houser, ""No Stone Unturned""
The opening track from Randy Houser's upcoming Magnolia finds its narrator in a nostalgic mood, poring over the vices and virtues of a life spent in a constant state of wanderlust. He's been everywhere from Colorado dispensaries to Bourbon Street bars, never shying away from a detour during his own journey toward self-discovery. ""I can always find one hell of a time while I'm out here looking for me,"" he sings in a baritone that booms and barks.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJkAkjEg4ZY

Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Merle Haggard, ""Old Friends""
Featuring one of Merle Haggard's final performances, ""Old Friends"" is the bittersweet sound of three outlaws riding together one more time, paying tribute to Roger Miller along the way. (The track appears on the new all-star King of the Road album.) Willie Nelson trades verses with his comrades and fills the bulk of the instrumental breaks with his loose, Spanish-influenced guitar playing, and Kristofferson takes a turn at the microphone, too. But it's Haggard's prayer-like verse — particularly the line ""Lord, when my work is done, bless my life and grant me one old friend"" — that packs the most emotional punch.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04PoHUgoTF4

Tanbark, ""Châtelet""
Move over, Voltaire — here, your intellectual match and oft-overlook partner Émilie du Châtelet receives her salute. With an unhurried gait that recalls Fleetwood Mac's folk-pop glory days, the Brooklyn duo Tanbark pull off the near-impossible, turning this tribute to an 18th-century French mathematician into something breezy, bouncy and not the least bit overly academic.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TwhlwJeUkc

JP Harris, ""JP's Florida Blues #1""
With its gonzo narrative, road-trip recollections and Fear and Loathing-worthy pace, ""JP's Florida Blues #1"" finds Harris stumbling through the bat country of his own stoned mind. ""I lost my mind out on the highway, seeking my inspiration with my nose,"" he sings, while a country-rock band rips and roars in the background. Caught somewhere between humor and hedonism, this song reads like an R-rated tour diary, delivered by a road warrior who's weathered his share of motel-room hangovers.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203462.50/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324145706-20190324171706-00259.warc.gz

https://youtu.be/VkloKZmQ3o4

Chase Rice, ""Eyes on You""
The country songwriter who professed his faith in ""Three Chords and the Truth"" takes a joyride here, heading from the beaches of Big Sur to the streets of Paris with an unnamed lover on his arm. Blindsided by her beauty, he winds up missing most of the scenery unfolding in the background. ""Don't matter where we've been. … Ain't no better view than you in my arms with my eyes on you,"" he sings, channeling Sam Hunt's delivery of spoken verses and crooned choruses.

https://youtu.be/CPIOmDamhQE

Logan Brill, ""Good Story""
""Might wake up lost, might wake up sore / But if you don't wake up dead then it made a good story,"" Logan Brill sings, shining a light on the bruises and blunders that, in hindsight, appear more humorous than hurtful. A tribute to the real-life details of every tall tale, ""Good Story"" moves at a kinetic pace, driven forward by an acoustic guitar that gives way to the choruses' anthemic, electrified stomp.

https://youtu.be/0mwL7DCMcpI

Cody Johnson, ""On My Way to You""
Johnson cut his teeth as an independent musician for more than a decade, slowly climbing his way toward the big leagues. He arrives with this year's Ain't Nothing to It, a major-label album stocked with Johnson's own brand of Texas-cowboy country-pop. He looks back on a similar journey with ""On My Way to You,"" a power ballad that finds him detailing the steps leading to his relationship with his wife.

https://soundcloud.com/heathermorganmusic/your-hurricane/s-BQGBe

Heather Morgan, ""Your Hurricane""
The chart-topping songwriter behind Brett Eldredge's ""Lose My Mind"" and ""Beat of the Music,"" Morgan makes her solo debut with this October's Borrowed Heart. ""Your Hurricane"" is the album's first single, mixing Morgan's elastic vocal runs with a melody written during a spontaneous trip to Joshua Tree after the 2016 ACM Awards. For someone who's spent the bulk of her career behind the scenes, Morgan wears her future-star threads well.

https://youtu.be/Mb6Hj1wAhyo

Austin Jenckes, ""Home for the Summer""
Jenckes named his recent West Coast tour after this single, whose summery stomp and open-armed choruses channel the uplift of a homecoming trip. ""Soon as I drive by that welcome sign, I don't need no map,"" he sings during the first verse, as he cruises into town in a swirl of nostalgia. By the song's end, he's retraced his steps from adolescence to adulthood, looking to heartland rockers like Bryan Adams for musical cues along the way.

https://youtu.be/VjynBqhOP9U

Caitlyn Smith, ""If I Didn't Love You""
Released on the deluxe vinyl edition of her debut album Starfire, ""If I Didn't Love You"" is a torch-song showcase for Caitlyn Smith's voice. She's a show-stopping singer, capable of a bluesy belt one minute — just listen to the song's final moments, where she repeats the song's title to electrifying effect — and a hushed croon the next.

https://soundcloud.com/robust-records/11-im-not-in-love-with-you/s-1Xr1d?in=robust-records/sets/justin-hiltner-jon-weisberger-watch-it-burn/s-ctJ0n

Justin Hiltner and Jon Weisberger, ""I'm Not in Love With You""
An openly gay musician in the relatively straight-laced world of bluegrass, Justin Hiltner wrote ""I'm Not in Love With You"" after falling for a straight man. The result — from Watch It Burn, Hiltner's collaborative album with songwriter Jon Weisberger — is a song that dresses up its traditional twang in contemporary clothing, building a bridge between the genre's buttoned-up past and a looser, unscripted future. IBMA winner Molly Tuttle makes a cameo on acoustic guitar, beefing up a band that also includes Della Mae's Kimber Ludiker on twin fiddle.

https://youtu.be/z1EqUZViZ2w

Travis Meadows, ""Underdogs""
""Underdogs"" is a roots-rock anthem for dark horses and long shots, delivered by the songwriter behind Kenny Chesney's new single ""Better Boat,"" Dierks Bentley's ""Riser"" and Eric Church's ""Knives of New Orleans."" Travis Meadows rasps the song's melodies in a voice pockmarked by years of hard living, and the effect is electrifying, like a bloodied boxer climbing to his feet for another chance at the title.

https://youtu.be/b1WgOITaEqc

Maggie Rose, ""Hey Blondie""
Inspired by the pissed-off pizazz of Blondie's Debbie Harry, ""Hey Blondie"" was recorded live in Nashville's Starstruck Studios with members of Steven Tyler's solo band. The result is a funky battle cry of empowerment that finds Maggie Rose turning the color of her hair into an armor-tough nickname. Stocked with call-and-response vocals, slide guitar, gospel organ and R&B grit, ""Hey Blondie"" isn't just a fine song — it's a stellar performance, too.

Michigan Rattlers, ""Didn't You Know""
With last year's Wasting the Meaning, Michigan Rattlers tipped their hat to those who came before them, covering songs by artists like Haim along the way. They return to their own sound with this year's Evergreen, a debut album rooted in alt-country sway and trad-rock swagger. ""Didn't You Know"" is the record's breezy single, built around a chorus that's as rural and lovely as their north Michigan origins.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202728.21/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323060839-20190323082839-00519.warc.gz

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqQsf6ZH1NY

Nobody’s Girl, “Call Me”
Blondie's 1980 chart-topper gets a millennial makeover. Caught halfway between arena-country and modern rock, the revamped ""Call Me"" finds Nobody's Girl layering their three-part harmonies over electric guitars, fiddle and driving drums. Bandmates Betty Soo, Grace Pettis and Rebecca Loebe are all seasoned songwriters in their own right, too, making ""Call Me"" an appetizer for the original songs that fill the band's upcoming release, Waterline.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekRUV3aoSY0

Willie Nelson, “Summer Wind”
It's been more than a half-century since Frank Sinatra released Strangers in the Night, an album that blended big-band bombast with mid-Sixties pop arrangements. Nelson does something similar with ""Summer Wind,"" the Strangers in the Night hit that appears in revised form on Nelson's new album of Sinatra covers My Way. Here, an upright bass roots a sparse arrangement of harmonica, piano, brushed percussion and acoustic guitar. Consider it a classic, countrified revamp of an American standard, performed by the Red Headed Stranger in honor of Ol' Blue Eyes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiRjB7nwBao

Rayland Baxter, “79 Shiny Revolvers”
Written the day Leonard Cohen died, ""79 Shiny Revolvers"" takes a satirical look at our country's fascination with firearms. The song's psychedelic pop nods to the Beatles, Dr. Dog and other bands whose gift for melody was matched by oddball humor. ""You really wanna save the world, man?"" he asks during the singalong chorus. ""Well, I wanna save it, too / We can blow 'em away, the American way."" In the background, an orchestral string section swells its way toward a crescendo, courtesy of producer Butch Walker.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=touzyt8EEL8

Lucero, “Cover Me”
Set for release next month, Lucero's Among the Ghosts marks the band's 20th anniversary. It's appropriate, then, that ""Cover Me"" harkens back to the band's roots, dishing up another serving of garage-rock grit and punky punch. Frontman Ben Nichols based the song's lyrics on the final scene of Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid, mixing his Southern sensibilities with some Wild West flair. ""On the count of three, cover me,"" he rasps, ending the song – just like the movie itself – before we discover the characters' fate.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7HgWfKbUVM

Cam, “Road to Happiness”
""Is the future that we're chasing worth the right-nows that we miss / On this road to happiness?"" sings Cam, shining a light on the uncertainty and self-doubt that fills every path toward stability. ""Road to Happiness"" is uncluttered, unforced and almost entirely unplugged, with Cam swapping the vocal acrobatics of her previous single, ""Diane,"" for a toned-down performance that suits the song's acoustic arrangement. So what if there are no show-stopping moments or sky-high notes? ""Road to Happiness"" is a lovely tribute to the journey, not the destination, and Cam wears her restraint well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDoBdK6tnio

Lori McKenna, “The Fixer”
A heartbreaking story of a sick wife and her attentive – but ultimately helpless – husband, ""The Fixer"" is Lori McKenna at her best: articulate, melodic and meditative, capable of wringing extraordinary emotions from ordinary topics. It's also one of the many highlights from The Tree, her 11th solo record. Produced by Dave Cobb, ""The Fixer"" refocuses well-deserved attention on the woman who wrote country hits like Little Big Town's ""Girl Crush"" and Tim McGraw's ""Humble and Kind,"" reminding everyone that McKenna can sing with the best of them, too.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwZfQSLxg3U

Kenny Chesney, “Better Boat”
With guest vocals from Mindy Smith and acoustic guitar arpeggios from Jimmy Buffett's right-hand man, Mac McAnally, this song is truly a team effort. Kenny Chesney's beach-bum persona has served him well for decades, but ""Better Boat"" turns the tide, spinning the story of a heartbroken man who's steadily patching himself up. Travis Meadows and Liz Rose wrote the tune, supplying Chesney with a sobering, slow-moving standout on his newest album, Songs for the Saints.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHYFkBdh6zw

Gregory Alan Isakov, “Chemicals”
The first single from this October's Evening Machines, ""Chemicals"" unfolds at a gentle pace. There's an endearingly oddball vibe to the song's first half, but ""Chemicals"" hits its stride during the chorus, which Gregory Alan Isakov sings in a warbling falsetto. ""Was it just chemicals in my head?"" he asks, trying to make sense of his own convolution. Recorded in a barn on Isakov's three-acre Colorado farm, this is the sound of befuddlement turned into beauty.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc0ADXvbeAY

The War and Treaty, “Are You Ready to Love Me?”
File this song under ""Motown-worthy."" Soulful and sweet, ""Are You Ready to Love Me?"" finds husband-and-wife partners Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Blount-Trotter preparing to get down to business. The song's title also doubles as a clever question to those who haven't heard the band's R&B-flavored roots music, which will receive its biggest push to date this August, when the full-length Healing Tide hits stores.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye4aPRomYyA

Hilary Williams, “Crazy”
The oldest granddaughter of Hank Williams Sr., Hilary Williams carries on the family business with this lead single from My Lucky Scars. ""You and I were meant to drive each other crazy,"" she sings during the chorus. Come for the waltzing tempo, which saunters and swings; stay for the electric guitar solo, whose blazing tone packs more attitude than Williams' granddad on a bender.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202723.74/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323040640-20190323062640-00535.warc.gz

https://youtu.be/wQkUK5fJBIo

The Get You (Featuring Kacey Musgraves), ""Pretty Good""
Taking a break from his gig as Sheryl Crow's drummer, Fred Eltringham steps up to the microphone for his first album with the Get You, a lo-fi garage band specializing in reimagined cover songs by Harry Nilsson, Lucinda Williams and other songwriters. Here, he turns John Prine's ""Pretty Good"" into a thumping power-pop gem, driving everything forward with alt-rock guitars and Kacey Musgraves' harmonies. Eltringham played drums on Musgraves' first two albums, thus turning this curveball cover into a full-circle reunion between two musicians at the top of their game.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHzcHEEaIUY

Kathy Mattea, ""Mercy Now""
Mary Gauthier's ""Mercy Now"" is turned into a hymn-like call for peace and brotherhood, backed by soft drums, pedal steel and acoustic guitar. The song swoons and swells, with Mattea singing each line in a voice that's deepened and darkened since her late-Eighties heyday. Topical and timely, the song is a much-needed reminder to stop pointing fingers and, instead, reach out for the hand of a neighbor in need.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akyvixqaDHs

Amy Helm, ""Michigan""
Levon Helm's daughter updates the Milk Carton Kids' ""Michigan,"" adding percussion, B3 organ and soulful stomp to a song that, in its original incarnation, was sparse and entirely acoustic. Under her direction, the song's chorus isn't just poignant — it's powerful, too, with Helm's voice leading a small choir of backup singers. The result is just as lonely-sounding as the original, but with significantly more personnel and rootsy punch.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkZLL2mK1oQ

Delta Rae, ""Do You Ever Dream?""
Struck by the sad reality of a crumbling relationship, Delta Rae's Brittany Holljes lets her imagination run wild, silently wondering if her partner ever thinks beyond the current moment, too. The rest of the band chimes in with thick harmonies and sweeping orchestration, turning ""Do You Ever Dream?"" into a richly arranged power ballad. Shot in rural Iceland, the song's music video is equally lush, with dreamy scenery that dovetails with Delta Rae's lyrics.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h83yKAGeoWI

Jackie Greene, ""Crazy Comes Easy""
Greene doubles down on his musical roots with ""Crazy Comes Easy,"" a bluesy blast of Southern rock and sunny soul. The song pays tribute to love's addled affect on the human mind, with a chorus that evokes the Black Crowes — whose final lineup featured Greene on electric guitar — and plenty of slide guitar. Recorded in the songwriter's home studio in Brooklyn, ""Crazy Comes Easy"" is the kickoff single from The Modern Lives - Vol. 2, which arrives next month.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05CBAKb0iE

Seth Ennis, ""Call Your Mama""
""Boy, listen to your mother, 'cause you ain't ever gonna get another,"" Seth Ennis sings on this gently rolling ballad. Debuted during his U.K. tour with Little Big Town, the song features thick harmonies from the vocal group, as well as a string of sweet, family-friendly reminders to touch base with the people you sometimes leave behind in the rearview mirror.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKi7WYasA6w

Carrie Underwood, ""Love Wins""
An open-armed anthem that calls for peace in a time of civil unrest, ""Love Wins"" is Carrie Underwood at her brazen best, filled with glory notes, gospel overtones and power-ballad gloss. She shies away from making direct references to politicians or unfair legislation, leaning instead on an ""all you need is love"" sentiment that goes down easily and inoffensively on both sides of the aisle. Co-written and co-produced by the singer herself, ""Love Wins"" is the second single from Underwood's upcoming Cry Pretty.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4C7i8NQCPk

Hymn for Her, ""Blue Balloons""
Like a modernized spin of Spirit's ""It's Nature's Way,"" ""Blue Balloons"" turns climate concerns and ecological anxiety into a psychedelic, left-field Americana song. Hymn for Her bandmates Wayne Waxing and Lucy Tight let their freak flag fly, lacing their tune with orchestral flourishes, coed harmonies and offbeat moments straight out of musical theater. At its core, though, ""Blue Balloons"" delivers a very sobering message, urging listeners to care for their planet before time runs out.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kfswep2HZBM

Terri Clark, ""Young As We Are Tonight""
""Raise that beer and be damn proud that you grew up 'round here,"" Clark sings during this seize-the-day epic. An upbeat reminder of time's relentless pace, ""Young As We Are Tonight"" urges its audience to pause, reflect and make the most of the current moment. In the background, an echoing drum pattern and a simmering, U2-worthy guitar riff help cement the song's carpe diem charisma.

The Gibson Brothers, ""Lay Your Body Down""
This ain't your grandfather's bluegrass music. Two-time winners of the International Bluegrass Music Association Awards' biggest honor, Entertainer of the Year, the Gibson Brothers expand far beyond their genre's twang-and-tradition cornerstones to build something new. Working with producer Dan Auerbach, they explore an amplified classic rock sound with ""Lay Your Body Down,"" a song that's as sexually direct as it is electrically driven. A full-length album, Mockingbird, will follow on November 9th, exploring the band's unconventional influences in rock, soul and beyond.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205600.75/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326180238-20190326202238-00316.warc.gz

Andrew Combs, ""Don't Tell Our Friends About Me""
A lovely reimagination of the Blake Mills original, shot through with equal parts melody and melancholy. Andrew Combs dresses up the arrangement with horns, harmonies and subdued strings, but it's his double-tracked voice that truly steals the show, offsetting the song's guilty conscience – this is an apology to a pissed-off lover, after all, with more than a dozen repetitions of the line ""I know I fucked up"" – with a gorgeous croon that makes a good case for forgiveness.

Frank Ray, ""Tequila Mockingbird""
""She's my low tide and my high tide / My umbrella in my Mai Thai,"" Frank Ray sings, rattling off a string of boozy, beachy metaphors in celebration of his lady friend. A former police offer who spent a decade patrolling the streets of Las Cruces, New Mexico, Ray tackled topical subjects like immigration on his 2017 EP Different Kind of Country. ""Tequila Mockingbird"" is a fowl of a different feather, though, with Ray – who filmed the song's music video in the appropriate setting of Key West, Florida – shifting his attention to waves, women and popped tops. Surf's up.

Rhonda Vincent, ""When the Grass Grows Over Me""
Released 50 years after George Jones' own version, Rhonda Vincent's cover of ""When the Grass Grows Over Me"" finds the bluegrass belle sangin' and twangin' in front of a sold-out crowd at the Ryman Auditorium, a performance that was captured for her new album Live at the Ryman. The instrumentation is traditional and top-notch, but it still plays second fiddle to Vincent's Grammy-grabbing croon, which warms the heart just before breaking it. Jones would approve.

Alejandro Escovedo, ""Sonica USA""
The son of Mexican immigrants, Alejandro Escovedo mines his own backstory for ""Sonica USA."" Featuring the MC5's Wayne Kramer on lead guitar, the punky track finds him looking back on his childhood days as a Chicano punk-rocker in the American Southwest. Escovedo covers similar ground on his upcoming album, The Crossing, a concept record revolving around a pair of migrant musicians.

Madison Cunningham, ""Beauty into Clichés""
The Punch Brothers' opening act offers a sneak preview of her upcoming album with this headliner-worthy knockout. ""Beauty into Clichés"" mourns the modern world's commodification of everything that's unique and unusual, with Madison Cunningham roasting some of her fellow songwriters along the way. ""Shouldn't it concern me that we shrink beauty to fit in our minds? / Don't have to listen to the whole song to know what's in the third line,"" she sings, accompanying herself with expert chugs of electric guitar along the way. For fans of Aimee Mann, Joni Mitchell and Jeff Buckley.

Riley Green, ""There Was This Girl""
Alabama native Riley Green – whom reality-TV fans may remember as the winner of CMT's Redneck Island – embodies his country upbringing on his new EP for BMLG Records, In a Truck Right Now. A collection of radio-ready songs produced by Dan Huff, the EP swings for the fences, leading with ""There Was This Girl,"" a song co-written by Green that gives credit where credit is due: nodding to the women whose inspiration drives men forward.

Eric Church, ""Desperate Man""
The Chief is back. Written with Ray Wylie Hubbard, Desperate Man's title track mixes the Sunday-morning sweep of gospel music with the samba-rock groove of the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil."" The result is unlike anything else on country radio, marking Eric Church as one of the genre's only heavyweights who's willing to reach far beyond tried-and-true trends.

Needtobreathe, ""Bullets""
""Bullets"" may have been recorded in Fort Worth, Texas, but the song – off the new EP Forever On Your Side (Niles City Sound Sessions) – takes its cues from other locales, channeling the funky fire of Motown and the soulful swagger of Dan Auerbach's Nashville-made recordings. ""You can't put the bullets back into a gun,"" howls the band's frontman, Bear Rinehart, while guitars growl, strings swoon and horns honk in the background. Had the song been released one year earlier, it might've soundtracked a scene from HBO's The Deuce, whose early-Seventies vibe suits Needtobreathe's dark makeover.

Carolina Story, ""We Were Young Once Too""
The husband-and-wife harmonies of Ben and Emily Roberts run throughout this gentle Americana ballad, which examines the effects of time upon a relationship. ""We Were Young Once Too"" is both appreciative of the present and nostalgic for the past, with Carolina Story's two members – both bound together by a love that's been sweetened and sharpened by age – pining for a time when innocence and ignorance made everything seem a bit brighter.

Edan Archer, ""Bad Imitation of Something Good""
Gainesville, Florida, native Edan Archer channels the influence of hometown hero Tom Petty with ""Bad Imitation of Something Good,"" a kinetic kiss-off to a lover who can't handle his woman's rough edges. ""You want a good woman by your side who puts the toothpaste cap on just right,"" she sings, delivering the chorus in a tone that's far more acerbic than apologetic. With its thick harmonies and heartland-rock guitars, the song nods to Petty's mid-Eighties period, back when he wrote country songs for Rosanne Cash and Lone Justice.

The March 5th, 1963, tragedy also took the lives of Hawkshaw Hawkins, Cowboy Copas and pilot Randy Hughes, who was the son-in-law of Copas and Cline's manager at the time.



A prodigiously talented vocal stylist who embraced country music and orchestrated pop sounds in the wake of rock & roll's emergence, at the time of her death Cline had scored crossover hits with ""Walking After Midnight,"" ""I Fall to Pieces"" and the Willie Nelson-penned ""Crazy."" Still, her musical and cultural impact wouldn't reach its zenith until years after her passing. 



Beginning March 4th, in celebration of Women's History Month and also marking the 85th anniversary of her birth, PBS will showcase Cline in their American Masters series with a documentary narrated by Rosanne Cash and featuring appearances by numerous women influenced by Cline, including Reba McEntire, LeAnn Rimes, Wanda Jackson, Kacey Musgraves, Rhiannon Giddens, Terri Clark, Margo Price, Mickey Guyton, Dottie West, Mandy Barnett and actress Beverly D'Angelo. Among the men who are interviewed are Ricky Warwick of the Irish rock band Thin Lizzy, and archival clips of Willie Nelson, Carl Perkins, and songwriters Harlan Howard and Hank Cochran, who co-wrote ""I Fall to Pieces.""



Here are 10 things we learned from Patsy Cline: American Masters.1. Nearly 20 years after her death, she inspired the performance of a Golden Globe-nominated actress.Beverly D'Angelo, who says the Opry legend had the most profound impact on her life, played Cline in the 1980 Oscar-winning film Coal Miner's Daughter and did all her own singing in the film. 2. As a child, she never stayed in one place for long.Cline was born Virginia Patterson Hensley on September 8th, 1932, and was called ""Ginny."" By the time she was 16, her family had moved 19 times.3. Her fascination with pop music developed at Washington and Lee University.Her father worked as a boiler man at the university and the family lived on campus. From her bedroom window, Ginny could hear big bands performing and would mimic the bands. Her mother eventually took Ginny and her brother and moved to Winchester,  Virginia.4. Her professional career began when she was just 14 years old.Ginny was regularly singing in bars and supper clubs and appeared on the Grand Ole Opry in August 1949 when she was 16. She had first auditioned for the long-running radio show when she was still underage.5. She had a job that was, quite literally, cutthroat.One of her earliest jobs was slitting the throats of chickens at a meat-packing plant, also when she was underage. Other jobs included cleaning Greyhound buses and working in a drugstore while singing at night.6. Her mother played the role of her ""talent scout"" on TV.In January 1957, Hilda Hensley introduced her daughter, who was now married to Gerald Cline and going by the name Patsy Cline, on the CBS series Arthur Godfrey Talent Scouts, an early precursor to American Idol and The Voice. Hensley didn't identify herself as Patsy's mother and when Godfrey asked, ""You've known her all her life?"" Hensley replied, ""Yes, just about.""7. Her early cowgirl image would change after that TV appearance.Hilda Hensley designed most of Patsy's cowgirl-inspired outfits. After singing ""Walking After Midnight"" on Talent Scouts and winning $10,000, which she gave to her mother to pay the mortgage on their house, Cline was approached by a female producer of the TV show who suggested she get away from the cowgirl outfits and dress more cosmopolitan. Bright red lipstick became one of her trademarks and occasionally she also wore men's pants, much to the consternation of Grand Ole Opry officials when she became a member in 1960.8. Her life would change when she met Charlie Dick.Cline was singing with a group called the Kountry Krackers band when she met the man who would become her second husband. Shortly after they met, Charlie was drafted into the U.S. Army. After her divorce from Gerald Cline, she and Charlie were married at Hilda's house in September 1957 and would move from Virginia to Nashville. They had two children, Julie, born in 1958, and Randy, born in 1961. They were married until Cline's death. Charlie died in 2015.9. A car crash nearly ended her life in 1961.In January 1961, ""I Fall to Pieces"" was released, becoming her first Number One hit. On June  14, 1961, Cline and her brother, Sam, were involved in a near-fatal head-on collision in Nashville. She would have permanent scars and chronic pain for the rest of her life, but would appear onstage at the Grand Ole Opry supported by crutches – and her fans – just a few weeks later.10. Her legacy is undeniable.In addition to performing with Johnny Cash at the Hollywood Bowl, she was booked into the Mint casino in Las Vegas for 35 nights. After playing a benefit in Kansas City on March 3rd, 1963, she told her concerned friend Dottie West, ""Don't worry about me, hoss. When it's my time to go, it's my time."" Rough weather would contribute to the plane crash that ended her life two days later. Her funeral in Winchester,  Virginia, attracted a crowd of 25,000 mourners. She would be the first solo female artist inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in October 1973. Always… Patsy Cline, a musical play inspired by her friendship with fan Louise Seger, would first star teenager Mandy Barnett and go on to be performed throughout the world. In 2005, Patsy Cline's Greatest Hits was certified diamond for sales in excess of 10 million. It remains one of the best-selling country albums by a female artist of all time and is in the Guinness Book of Records, holding the title for the most weeks an album by a woman has spent on the country chart.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203493.88/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324210143-20190324232143-00430.warc.gz

But over the course of a morning at his Tennessee home, the ACM Entertainer of the Year, who released his latest album They Don&apos;t Know in September, will begin to open up. He&apos;ll show you around the barn on the far end of his property, where an archivist is currently sorting through Aldean&apos;s stuff for a special project. In storage: a Donkey Kong arcade game, a new deer feeder and piles of clothes and photographs.For Aldean, the past can be just as important as the future. Over coffee and Coca-Cola, he candidly recalls the beginnings of his recording career, how he first met Brantley Gilbert and why a 2013 concert ranks as his greatest live-show moment. Here are 10 things we learned from hanging out with the ""Any Ol&apos; Barstool"" singer.1. Broken Bow Records almost didn&apos;t sign him.The Nashville label, Aldean&apos;s home since his 2005 debut, didn&apos;t have room for another artist. ""Jon Loba [executive VP at Broken Bow] came out and saw my show [at Nashville&apos;s Wildhorse Saloon.]. And on the way there he was telling Benny Brown, the head of the label, &apos;We don&apos;t need any more artists! We need to work with the ones we have.&apos; He was trying to convince Benny not to sign anyone else. But after the show, Benny came back and told me he wanted me on the label.""2. He lost his very first record deal, with Capitol Records.""They signed me and Cyndi Thomson and Cyndi made an album and had a few hits. I never recorded one song while I was there. I just sat there, and at some point, being a 22-year-old kid, I was over sitting around and [them] not letting me record anything. I started asking a bunch of questions and let them know I wasn&apos;t happy with the way it was going. Then they had a change of the label head and I got dropped.""3. Two songs from his 2010 smash My Kinda Party are almost always in his set list: ""Tattoos on This Town"" and ""Flyover States.""""&apos;Tattoos&apos; is still one of my favorite songs to sing live, and &apos;Flyover States&apos; was almost on the Wide Open record. It came in late and we had the record done and didn&apos;t have a spot for it. We ended up not cutting it and cut it for [My Kinda Party],"" says Aldean, who enjoys watching the crowd pop when he begins the Middle America anthem. ""That song gets as big of a reaction as anything we play.""4. Brantley Gilbert&apos;s fans once accused Aldean of stealing ""Dirt Road Anthem"" and ""My Kinda Party,"" both of which Gilbert co-wrote.""When I heard &apos;Dirt Road Anthem,&apos; I didn&apos;t even know who Brantley was. The first time I ever met Brantley was when we were in the studio recording his songs. He came by to hear them and he had just moved to town. He didn&apos;t even have a record deal yet. When that album came out, a lot of his fans were like, &apos;You&apos;re stealing Brantley&apos;s song!&apos; It&apos;s funny now. He went on Twitter or something and was like, &apos;Hey, everybody, chill out.&apos;""Aldean and Gilbert have since become good friends. ""I just saw him; he had shown me his house he just built. I said, &apos;How long did you have that?&apos; He said, &apos;I built it about the time ""Dirt Road Anthem"" became a hit.&apos; So it worked out pretty good.""5. Florida Georgia Line gave him one of his biggest hits, much to his surprise.""Those guys were out on tour with me and played me &apos;Burnin&apos; It Down.&apos; I was stunned that they weren&apos;t cutting it. I said, &apos;Put it on hold for me&apos; and I called [my producer] and was like, &apos;Check this shit out,&apos;"" says Aldean, who also cut FGL&apos;s ""Lights Come On"" for his latest album They Don&apos;t Know. ""Burnin&apos; It Down,"" meanwhile, has since been certified double platinum.6. While he never bought his mom a pink Cadillac, he does admit to occasionally spoiling his parents.""I don&apos;t want to get too much into that, because I don&apos;t want one going, &apos;You did that?&apos; [Laughs] But I&apos;ve definitely tried to take care of them over the years and do things for them. I&apos;m very fortunate in what I&apos;ve done and what I have and I wouldn&apos;t be here without them supporting decisions I made, like not to go to college and pursue music.""7. Aldean swears there&apos;s no wild parties after his shows.""There&apos;s not really an after-party. We finish the show and go back with the guys in the band and hang out in our dressing room backstage. That&apos;s our time. During the course of the day, everybody is doing their own thing. Then we go do the show and come back. It&apos;s not like it used to be where you were pouring liquor down [your throat]!""8. Aldean&apos;s 2013 concert at University of Georgia&apos;s Sanford Stadium, home of the Georgia Bulldogs, is his favorite concert he&apos;s ever played.""Just being from there and that being my team, there were a lot of cool things about that night. It was a show that I played for my home crowd. It was for all the people that, when I left Macon to come to Nashville, would call me and ask, &apos;What&apos;s going on?&apos; And I&apos;d say, &apos;Well, I got dropped from my deal.&apos; So to come back and have them see it on that level, it was a wow moment. It was the first and only concert to be held at that stadium. I don&apos;t know if we&apos;ll ever play another show like that – and I don&apos;t know that I want to.""9. He is baffled by the existence of TMZ.""You have a news channel and a website that is devoted 24/7 to celebrities and stuff they do. I don&apos;t get that, man, and I don&apos;t pay attention. I will never understand why people are so interested in people&apos;s personal sides. No offense, but whatever is going on in your personal life, that&apos;s your business. It don&apos;t have anything to do with me.""10. He knows when to pick himself up and carry on.""I don&apos;t sit there and overthink things to death. I&apos;m human. I make mistakes. But I don&apos;t dwell on it. I&apos;ll make a mistake and go, &apos;That sucked – I probably shouldn&apos;t do that again,&apos; and then I don&apos;t do that again. And if you ask me a question, I&apos;m going to answer it. It may not be the most politically correct thing to say, but I&apos;ll tell you what I think.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204077.10/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325153323-20190325175323-00314.warc.gz
7,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/2015-grammy-nominees-for-best-country-song-73501/,"Miranda Lambert and Eric Church have their second 2015 Grammy nominations (so far), as the Best Country Song category was announced via Twitter today. The Texas spitfire&apos;s nostalgic ""Automatic"" is up for the honor, as is the North Carolina country-rocker&apos;s aching ""Give Me Back My Hometown."" Lambert shares the nomination with co-writers Nicolle Galyon and Natlie Hemby; Church is up with writing partner Luke Laird, who took home the Grammy last year for Best Country Album, as a co-producer of Kacey Musgraves&apos; Same Trailer, Different Park.

Laird is a double nominee in the Best Country Song category, as he also co-wrote Kenny Chesney&apos;s ""American Kids,"" alongside Shane McAnally and Galyon&apos;s husband, Rodney Clawson. Tim McGraw and Faith Hill&apos;s ""Meanwhile Back at Mama&apos;s"" scores nominations for writers Jeffrey Steele, Tom Douglas and Jaren Johnston. And ailing country legend Glen Campbell rounds out the category, earning a nod with co-writer Julian Raymond for ""I&apos;m Not Gonna Miss You,"" which is the final song he recorded before retiring and moving in to a Nashville medical facility to treat his Alzheimer&apos;s Disease.
Additionally, Lambert and Church are up for Best Country Album, sharing that category with Dierks Bentley, Lee Ann Womack and fellow double-nominee Brandy Clark, who is also up for the all-genre Best New Artist honors. Later this afternoon, 82 of the Grammys&apos; 83 categories will be announced, with the Recording Academy&apos;s top honor, Album of the Year, to be revealed during tonight&apos;s LL Cool J-hosted A Very Grammy Christmas special, airing at 9 p.m. ET on CBS.
The 57th annual Grammy Awards will air live from Los Angeles on February 8, 2015, also on CBS.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203448.17/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324124545-20190324150545-00205.warc.gz
8,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/2016-cma-awards-nominations-biggest-snubs-and-surprises-250979/,"As the dust settles on the 2016 CMA Awards nominations, announced Wednesday morning from Nashville, it stirs the usual mix of ""they got it right!"" and righteous indignation. While the latter might not be expressed by the artists themselves – not everyone is as ballsy as Sturgill Simpson – some of this year&apos;s snubs do deserve a public forum.Most egregious: the exclusion of Cam in the Female Vocalist and New Artist races. While the singer-songwriter&apos;s stark, vulnerable ""Burning House"" (a Grammy nominee earlier this year) earned nods for Song of the Year and Video, the California native was shut out of the Female Vocalist race in favor of another newcomer, Maren Morris, one of the CMAs&apos; leading nominees with five. The biggest oversight with regards to Cam, however, is her omission from the Best New Artist category. While Cole Swindell has had a great year with his You Should Be Here LP and its poignant title track, he was already nominated in the category two years ago, shortly after he notched his first Number One single – Cam seems the more timely choice, especially given her Grammy recognition. Meanwhile, 2014&apos;s Best New Artist winner Brett Eldredge, renowned for his smooth voice and his two recent hits ""Lose My Mind"" and ""Drunk on Your Love,"" is criminally absent from the Male Vocalist category. In the Entertainer of the Year race, Carrie Underwood makes her first-ever appearance in the category, which is surprising only because it&apos;s taken this damn long. Chris Stapleton, who led the charge for traditional country with 2015&apos;s Album of the Year Traveller, and won in two other categories, joins Underwood as a first-timer in the Entertainer nominees. Underwood&apos;s nod, and the arguably early inclusion for Stapleton in the most prestigious category, helped bump Kenny Chesney, Eric Church and Miranda Lambert, who were all nominated last year. After a streak of nominations from 2002 to 2009, Chesney only made the Entertainer cut again in 2012 and 2015, but the four-time champ is between albums, with his upcoming Cosmic Hallelujah having been bumped from a summer release to late October. The absence of Church&apos;s name is much more surprising, as he&apos;s tied with Morris and Stapleton for the most nominations and has consistently sold out his arena tours. Lambert was an Entertainer nominee in 2015 and is the reigning Female Vocalist for the sixth record year. She has a chance to extend that streak to seven, but the apparent breakout of Morris, bolstered by her sing-along hit ""My Church,"" may threaten Lambert repeating.Lambert&apos;s ex-husband Blake Shelton, meanwhile, whose five-time streak as Male Vocalist was snapped last year, isn&apos;t even a contender at the 50th annual CMAs. His post-divorce album If I&apos;m Honest – released in May within the voting eligibility period of July 1st, 2015, through June 30th, 2016 – didn&apos;t resonate with voters, nor did Shelton&apos;s status as a pop-culture figure on The Voice land him back in the Entertainer field. Touring and radio giant Jason Aldean was also a notable snub for both Male Vocalist and Entertainer of the Year, while Kacey Musgraves, who has struggled for radio airplay despite the critical acclaim for her album Pageant Material, landed an out-of-left-field Female Vocalist nomination. But Margo Price, another acclaimed trad-country singer-songwriter who scored a high-profile appearance on Saturday Night Live in April, and the revered Brandy Clark were overlooked, as were their respective albums Midwest Farmer&apos;s Daughter and Big Day in a Small Town. Like Price and Clark, Sturgill Simpson also appeared on the initial ballot for CMA voting, but he too failed to advance to a nomination – not that he would have attended the ceremony anyway.When it comes to the Vocal Duo and Vocal Group categories, the nominees are the usual suspects, with a couple of exceptions. Best New Artist nominees Old Dominion take the Band Perry&apos;s slot from last year in Vocal Group, while Thompson Square, a 2015 Duo contender are MIA. In their place is arguably the most touching nomination of the CMA Awards: a Vocal Duo nod for Joey + Rory. Last nominated in 2010, the husband-and-wife duo return to the category one final time, a fitting tribute to the couple in light of Joey Feek&apos;s death from cancer earlier this year.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202689.76/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322200215-20190322222215-00083.warc.gz

Cyndi Lauper is gunning for a Democratic presidency as well, telling Rolling Stone Country during a March 2016 interview that Clinton is ""the person who can actually do the job.""Other roots musicians have been outspoken in their distaste for Republican candidate Donald Trump, although that doesn&apos;t necessarily indicate an endorsement of his opponent. ""There is a person in this room who has never heard of Donald Trump. Let&apos;s keep it that way,"" Jason Isbell scribbled onto a note in September 2015, shortly after the birth of his daughter. He then taped the note to the door of his wife&apos;s hospital room and tweeted the image. One month later, Steven Tyler&apos;s lawyers drafted a far more threatening note to Trump&apos;s organization, threatening to pursue ""any and all legal or equitable remedies"" if the organization continued its unauthorized use of the Aerosmith song ""Dream On"" during campaign rallies. Finally, Margo Price got poetic as 2015 came to a close, tweeting out a message in December that rhymed Trump&apos;s name with a number of choice nouns and phrases, including ""dump,"" ""chump"" and ""I need a stomach pump.""Regardless, Trump has still racked up a larger share of country-music champions. Kid Rock, Lee Brice, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Chris Janson all performed at the RNC last week, with Janson even revising the lyrics of his biggest songwriting hit, ""Truck Yeah,"" to ""Trump Yeah."" Earlier in the month, Ronnie Dunn took to Facebook to pledge his own support, listing the alleged benefits a Trump presidency would bring. (Among them: ""You can say whatever you want without being called a racist, Islamophobic, xenophobic, etc."") And then there&apos;s longtime Republican supporters the Oak Ridge Boys, whose Joe Bonsall proudly took to Twitter this week to flaunt the purchase of an engraved brick bearing the inscription ""Build that wall!"" According to Bikers 4 Trump, whose website currently offers the customized bricks at $49.95 a piece, the building materials will be used to construct a ""Memorial Border Ball"" on State Highway 49 outside of Atlanta.Meanwhile, most country stars are remaining silent — or, in the case of two country icons, temporarily neutral. ""I try not to get political,"" Dolly Parton wrote in a recent press release, ""but if I am, I might as well just run myself &apos;cause I&apos;ve got the hair for it, it&apos;s huge, and they could always use more boobs in the race."" Equally irreverent is a statement from the otherwise notoriously political Hank Williams Jr., who told Rolling Stone Country that he was more concerned with his career than any political race.

Pop diva Pink is set to perform, as will former One Direction singer Niall Horan, who joins Maren Morris. Reba McEntire and Kelsea Ballerini are also scheduled to duet.Who are the new artists to know? First-time nominees include California crooner Brett Young, neo-traditionalist Jon Pardi and Nineties revivalist Luke Combs, who all land in this year's New Artist of the Year category (along with Old Dominion and Lauren Alaina). Veteran tag team LoCash earn their first nod for Vocal Duo of the Year, and Americana stalwart Jason Isbell earns his first-ever CMA nomination: Album of the Year for his LP The Nashville Sound.Will Taylor Swift be there? It's certainly possible. Although she appeared at last year's milestone 50th CMAs, to present Entertainer of the Year, she's actually nominated this time: her first nod since 2014, as the songwriter of Little Big Town's ""Better Man,"" up for Song of the Year. To boot, the previous two CMAs have featured pop superstars in key performances – Justin Timberlake joined Chris Stapleton in 2015, and Beyoncé ignited controversy in 2016 with the Dixie Chicks. With a new album due Friday, Swift could stage another Nashville homecoming. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201329.40/warc/CC-MAIN-20190318132220-20190318154220-00379.warc.gz

Marking the first community-wide gathering of country stars in Las Vegas since the October 1st mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest festival, those on hand will seek to thread a needle of respectful remembrance for the victims, while also finding a way to show viewers at home a good time.Tributes and calls to carry on with courage and compassion will no doubt permeate the evening, but the event is still a celebration of the year's biggest hits and artists, with performances by Carrie Underwood, Jason Aldean, Miranda Lambert, Thomas Rhett, Keith Urban and Alan Jackson – plus the return of a beloved host  – all set to highlight the telecast.Here's everything you need to know before the 53rd annual ACM Awards kick off Sunday night.How to watch: The 2018 Academy of Country Music Awards ceremony will air April 15th at 8:00 p.m. ET on CBS, and although lips have been sealed about the night's opening number, you can bet it will be the show's first must-see moment. Red carpet arrivals and interviews will take place in the hours leading up to the event, with various digital outlets covering arrivals.Who's hosting? Country Music Hall of Fame member Reba McEntire returns as the host of this year's ACM Awards for what seems like the umpteenth time – and that's a good thing. It's actually her 15th year as the night's emcee, having led the program solo and with co-hosts like Blake Shelton, Hank Williams Jr. and more dating back to 1986. She replaces Luke Bryan and Dierks Bentley this time, who guided proceedings for the past two years.Who's up for awards? Chris Stapleton leads the pack with eight nominations in five categories, including his first ACM nod for Entertainer of the Year. Thomas Rhett follows with six nods stemming from his third album, Life Changes, Keith Urban is up for five trophies, and Maren Morris and Miranda Lambert will vie for four each. If Lambert wins at least one, she'll become the winningest artist in ACM Awards history. Who will take the stage? Carrie Underwood will deliver the live debut of her new song ""Cry Pretty"" – her first TV appearance since suffering a fall that required surgery in November. Other performers include perennials Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean and Miranda Lambert, along with rising stars Maren Morris, Thomas Rhett and country trio Midland. Longtime country favorites Little Big Town and Kenny Chesney are on tap, as are pop stars like Bebe Rexha – who will join Florida Georgia Line for their crossover hit ""Meant to Be."" There are also a number of notable country collaborations, including Blake Shelton and Toby Keith singing ""Should've Been a Cowboy"" and Kelly Clarkson and Reba singing ""Does He Love You.""Who are the new artists to know? Brett Young, Midland and Lauren Alaina have already been announced as winners in the New Artist categories. All three will take the stage this year, along with last year's New Male Vocalist Jon Pardi. ""Greatest Love Story"" hitmakers Lanco are up for their first trophy – Vocal Group of the Year – and two names you might be familiar with are making their first appearance in a new category: Tim McGraw and Faith Hill are up for Vocal Duo of the Year.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202326.46/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320105319-20190320131319-00175.warc.gz

15,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/2018-cma-awards-nominations-5-things-we-learned-716700/,"The nominations for the 2018 CMA Awards were unveiled Tuesday morning and the list of contenders is as unsurprising as a Luke Bryan song going to Number One: men ruled, radio exerted its omnipresent influence and good luck breaking through if your record label doesn't operate within the traditional Music Row sphere. There were some moments of light — Kacey Musgraves, Chris Stapleton and Dierks Bentley's albums were all welcome and deserving inclusions, as were Chris Janson's ""Drunk Girl"" and anything related to the Brothers Osborne — but a lot of disappointments, too. We break down what we learned from studying this year's nominees.

Radio Rules
Want a nomination? Better have a hit. Nowhere is the power of country radio more apparent than in this particular group of contenders, from the top down. Just take a look at Song of the Year, a category that is supposed to be more about lyrical content than chart success or production. Instead, it's a group of tracks that all have enjoyed success at country radio, somehow including Sam Hunt's ""Body Like a Back Road"" for the second year in a row. How about ""A Little Dive Bar in Dahlonega"" by Ashley McBryde? Or ""Space Cowboy"" by Kacey Musgraves""? (Oh right, they weren't hits.) And even though it's women who suffer discrimination when it comes to radio rotation, there's proof here that even deserving men are losing out. Glance at the Male Vocalist of the Year field and ask where is Brent Cobb, Charlie Worsham or Kip Moore? It's no surprise that on the same day the CMA announces these awards, they also unveil the broadcast nominees — a special set of awards for radio alone.

""New Artist"" Is a Relative Term
The CMA Awards' most disappointing category has been, year after year, New Artist. Like the Grammy Awards recognizing Bon Iver or Lil Uzi Vert, it should be a chance to celebrate those who haven't yet had a Number One party in their honor. But this category includes three repeat names from last year's race: Luke Combs, Brett Young and Lauren Alaina. All are riding high, but it'd be refreshing to see five new names this year. Midland and Chris Janson (now an Opry member and feeling more like a veteran than a newbie after 10 years in town) are good starts, but Ashley McBryde and Carly Pearce would have also been excellent inclusions, along with Margo Price, Lindsay Ell, Kane Brown and Devin Dawson. It's a shame this pool is so narrow.

Voters Still Love Chris Stapleton (and Kacey Musgraves)
Stapleton reigns as this year's most nominated (he scored five), proving that voters have a sweet spot for his enormous talent. Thankfully they still have one for Kacey Musgraves too, the rare artist to break through without radio play. If her fantastic Golden Hour was left out of contention from Album of the Year, we would have staged a coup.

No Major Label? No Nomination.
Just like radio success seems to be a key predictor of who will be nominated for a CMA award, so is what record label an artist calls home — none of the performers this year belong to anything other than a major label or a Music Row player that operates in a similar fashion (like Black River, home to Kelsea Ballerini). Nashville's insular nature is on full display here, which means no indie nominee can sneak in, like Jason Isbell did last year.

Country Still Has a Serious Diversity Problem
Let's start with the obvious: women are sorely lacking representation across all areas of this year's nominations. No women Entertainers. No nominated Songs or Singles by solo women. Airplay rules yet again, and female artists (aside from a few, even including crossovers like Bebe Rexha) just aren't getting spins. The awards have an ageist streak this year as well: country elders like Willie Nelson and John Prine (who both released superlative albums in April) are absent, as is Shania Twain, who has been wowing audiences on her Shania Now Tour and released an album of new material, to boot. Beyond that, performers of color are completely absent. Kane Brown enjoyed two of the year's biggest hits with ""Heaven"" and ""What Ifs,"" but is still looking to earn his first nomination.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202523.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321112407-20190321134407-00548.warc.gz

Lambert will also take the stage with her Pistol Annies partners Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley, in a rare TV appearance for the trio.

Reigning Entertainer of the Year Garth Brooks, who has won in that category a record six times since 1991, will also perform, as will Male Vocalist and New Artist of the Year nominee Luke Combs, first-time nominees Midland, and Brett Young — a previous two-time nominee also vying in the hotly contested New Artist category, which also includes Lauren Alaina and Chris Janson.

Also set to perform are the previously announced Kelsea Ballerini, Dierks Bentley with Brothers Osborne, Luke Bryan, Kenny Chesney, Dan + Shay, Florida Georgia Line with Bebe Rexha, Kacey Musgraves, Old Dominion, Thomas Rhett, Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood, who co-hosts for the 11th consecutive year with Brad Paisley. More performers and presenters will be announced in the days ahead.

Chris Stapleton leads the slate of this year's nominees with five mentions in the categories of Entertainer, Album, Male Vocalist, Single and Song of the Year. Producer Dann Huff, on the strength of projects for Keith Urban, Midland and Thomas Rhett, follows with four nods.

17,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/2018-country-music-hall-of-fame-medallion-ceremony-10-best-moments-745407/,"On Sunday night, Ricky Skaggs, Dottie West and Johnny Gimble were welcomed as the newest members of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum at the 2018 Medallion Ceremony, held in the museum's CMA Theater. Garth Brooks presented bluegrass stalwart Skaggs with the Hall’s Modern Era honor. Connie Smith inducted late fiddle great Gimble in the Hall’s Recording and/or Touring Musician category. And Brenda Lee led a tribute to her late friend, Grammy-winning classic country turned pop-crossover star Dottie West, who received the Hall’s Veteran Era honor. Performances and speeches from Brooks, Dierks Bentley, Chris Stapleton, Smith and Grand Ole Opry star Jeannie Seely highlighted an evening that was at times touching, hilarious and even surreal for those onstage and in the audience alike. Here’s a look at the 10 best moments from this year’s ceremony.

Garth Brooks shoots from the hip.
In an appearance recalling his induction of Randy Travis to the Country Music Hall of Fame two years ago, Garth Brooks was on hand to welcome another one of his musical heroes, Ricky Skaggs, into the format’s most exclusive club. Explaining that he didn’t know he was actually giving the speech to induct Skaggs in addition to paying tribute to him with a performance of “Highway 40 Blues,” Brooks opted to shoot from the hip with a heartfelt, stream of consciousness address hailing Skaggs’ lasting traditional influence on country music with bluegrass-tinged hits such as “Don’t Cheat in Our Hometown” and “Uncle Pen.” In his acceptance speech, Skaggs thanked Brooks for being one of his biggest cheerleaders through the years and also thanked Brooks and his wife Trisha Yearwood for just being real. 

The Time Jumpers electrify with their Johnny Gimble tribute.
Joe Spivey, Kenny Sears and Larry Franklin — the Time Jumpers' triple-threat fiddle players — teamed up with singer David Ball (“Thinkin’ Problem”) to kick off the night with an electrifying performance of the Twenties' jazz ballad “Right or Wrong” in honor of late fiddle player Johnny Gimble. The sheer power of those three fiddles sawing away was a good reminder of just how exciting it is to watch virtuosity in action. A native Texan, Gimble played “Right or Wrong” many times as a member of Bob Wills’ Texas Playboys and went on to play that fiddle part again on George Strait’s chart-topping 1984 cover version. Gimble also appeared on classic recordings from Merle Haggard, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson, as well as on Paul McCartney’s storied 1974 Nashville sessions.



The Hall plays up its academic credentials.
This year’s Medallion Ceremony got off to an odd start with the Country Music Hall of Fame board chairman Steve Turner standing onstage along with three of his fellow board members in academic robes and sashes recognizing their status as members of the organization’s Circle Guard. According to a July press release, the new group spotlights former and current Hall of Fame board members who have donated their “time, talent and treasure” to the Hall to “safeguard the integrity of country music and make it accessible to a global audience through the museum.” While these individuals certainly deserve recognition for their efforts, the visual of these men wearing such formal collegiate attire might have come off slightly less elite and stuffy if they'd been decorated instead with some Manuel-style rhinestones and fringe.



Chris Stapleton delivers simmering mountain soul.
The continuing influence of bluegrass music on today’s country music was most apparent when reigning CMA Male Vocalist Chris Stapleton paid tribute to his fellow Kentuckian Ricky Skaggs with a simmering cover of the Ralph Stanley-penned “Darkest Hour Is Just Before Dawn.” Skaggs and Emmylou Harris recorded a duet of that bluegrass chestnut on Harris’s 1980 bluegrass album, Roses in the Snow, and Stapleton admitted he got a little choked up watching the tribute footage of Skaggs and bluegrass giant Bill Monroe that ran before his performance. Armed with just an acoustic guitar around his neck, Stapleton never let his commanding voice fully ring out as he delivered the inspirational lyrics about keeping faith when all seems lost. It was an exercise in the power of restraint and a reminder that Stapleton’s connection with audiences owes a lot to those bluegrass roots.



Female artists celebrate Dottie West's legacy of girl power.
In a moment most relevant to today’s conversation on women in country music, Country Music Hall of Fame member Brenda Lee called fellow female artists Trisha Yearwood, Emmylou Harris, Jan Howard, Jeannie Seely and Connie Smith out of the audience onto the stage to help her induct the late Dottie West. A longtime friend of West, Lee told the audience, “It’s gonna take a village to induct this woman.” Just as Patsy Cline welcomed West with open arms upon her arrival in Nashville in the early Sixties, West paid that gift forward sharing camaraderie and friendship with scores of women coming up after her in country music, including Seely, who kicked off the musical tributes with a performance of West’s first Grammy-winning hit from 1964, “Here Comes My Baby.”

Dierks Bentley straddles the lines of country and bluegrass.
Dierks Bentley’s career has been on an upward artistic swing even since he made his critically acclaimed 2010 bluegrass-influenced album, Up on the Ridge. Since then, banjo and mandolin sounds have shown up even more prominently in his mainstream country radio hits, and that’s a formula he learned from studying Skaggs’ wide and varied musical playbook. Bentley said it was “probably the biggest night of my career” and “definitely the most surreal” getting to pay tribute to Skaggs’ melding of bluegrass and country with a performance of Skaggs’ 1982 steel guitar-drenched hit “You’ve Got a Lover.”
Emmylou Harris is brought to tears.
The usually reserved Emmylou Harris was brought to tears as her former band member and duet partner Skaggs used a good chunk of his acceptance speech to thank her for introducing his music to the international stage. Skaggs was a key player in shepherding Harris’s music toward a more acoustic, bluegrass sound in the late Seventies. Their work together would reach its summit with Harris’s 1980 bluegrass album, Roses in the Snow, which heavily featured Skaggs on fiddle, banjo, mandolin, acoustic guitar and duet vocals. This tearful exchange between two of country music’s most fervent keepers of the flame was one of the night’s most profound moments.




Ricky Skaggs plays Bill Monroe’s mandolin.
This year’s standout Medallion Ceremony moment came at the end of the night as inductee Skaggs was allowed to play his mentor Bill Monroe’s 1923 Gibson F-5 mandolin. The instrument is a centerpiece of the Country Music Hall of Fame’s Precious Jewels exhibit, and Skaggs is one of the only people in the world worthy of making that mandolin ring out again with a show-closing rendition of the Hall’s official anthem, “Will the Circle Be Unbroken.” As a six-year-old bluegrass prodigy, Skaggs was allowed onstage at a Bill Monroe show in Kentucky to play that very mandolin under the watchful eye of Monroe, who instructed his young student to play the instrument hard as if he was whipping a mule. Playing it again as a 64-year-old man now credited with carrying on Mr. Monroe’s bluegrass tradition, Skaggs was visibly overcome with emotion. He even talked to the instrument onstage in a touching, yet surreal scene as he stressed the role that mandolin played in helping Monroe create the bluegrass genre.

Dottie West is honored for shepherding new talent.
Before performing a duet of West’s Coca-Cola jingle-turned-country hit, “Country Sunshine,” Steve Wariner and Larry Gatlin both credited West with giving them the encouragement and the opportunity to move to Nashville to launch their careers. Touching on her mother’s generous spirit, West’s daughter Shelly spoke of trying to get out the front door to go to school and having to step over the sleeping bodies of aspiring songwriters finding shelter on the family’s living room floor. She said, “Can you imagine growing up with Roger Miller, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson in your living room all night?” These stories point to West’s dual role as a respected country singer-songwriter as well as de facto den mother for the artists we now regard as the icons of country music.



The War and Treaty bring down the house.
In a nod to Dottie West’s flashy foray into pop-country in the late Seventies and early Eighties, Americana husband-and-wife duo the War and Treaty brought down the house with a fiery, soulful take on West’s 1980 chart-topping kiss-off anthem, “A Lesson in Leavin’.” The performance rocked so hard the usually reverent audience actually stood up to clap along mid-song. Jo Dee Messina covered the song in 1999, but West’s funky original — with its opening drum break and electric piano flourishes that lean more R&B than traditional country — is evidence that country’s slick Urban Cowboy period produced a few outright classics.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202704.58/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323000443-20190323022443-00455.warc.gz

She was on the Chapel Stage, a tiny and cozily crowded church with an overflow crowd outside pressed against the windows.""What a cool thing,"" Hiatt marveled, nodding at the scene. ""We're at Willie’s ranch – Shit!""Truly, Nelson's world has become one of the coolest hangouts during South by Southwest, the annual mega-festival that draws six-figure mobs to Austin every March. About 3,000 in-the-know attendees make this pilgrimage to Nelson's country spread about 45 minutes from town, to get a slice of the ""old"" Austin that fell to bulldozers and skyscrapers years ago.Luck Reunion, produced by Ellee Fletcher, Matt Bizer, Scott Marsh and Nelson's wife Annie, happens on what was originally a movie set, a small town's worth of houses, barns and saloons constructed for the 1986 film version of Nelson's classic mid-Seventies concept album Red Headed Stranger. And with some three-dozen acts playing on four stages over the course of 12 hours, it was impossible not to feel like you were missing something every single moment.Nelson himself was the main headliner, of course, and he was also tangentially present during the Americana-as-big-tent undercard, which featured plenty of his family and friends. Rising guitar god Lukas Nelson, Willie's 29-year-old son, led his band the Promise of the Real through a set of powerful six-string excursions that evoked the feeling of distant galaxies exploding. And he was preceded by younger brother Micah ""Particle Kid"" Nelson crooning ""Everything Is Bullshit."" Meanwhile, Hiss Golden Messenger was playing a quietly lovely acoustic set on a smaller stage just far enough away to not be drowned out.Bucolic splendor was the order of the day, courtesy of the ruggedly beautiful Texas Hill Country. At the same time Hiatt was playing the Chapel Stage, an acoustic song swap was in progress over at the nearby Revival Tent Stage with Kevn Kinney, Caleb Caudle, Sam Lewis and Courtney Marie Andrews. An inquisitive horse wandered over from a nearby pasture to nose through the fence behind the stage as longtime Drivin' N Cryin' frontman Kinney sang about the ""Sun-Tangled Angel Revival.""Other highlights included Margo Price's set in the Chapel, complete with a solo piano reading of her ""All American Made""; Nashville's Devon Gilfillian, an old-school soul man with the perfect knack for salting each sweet song with just the right amount of guitar grit; the superhumanly multi-talented Aaron Lee Tasjan, who closed his set with a great guitar duel with cameo guest Kinney; and the high-volume atmospherics of Liz Cooper & the Stampede.Then there were Texas Gentlemen, the Lone Star State's very own Wrecking Crew and session band for countless Americana-leaning albums. Their ""Gents & Dames"" program brought up some of the distaff singers they've backed up recently, including Nicole Atkins, Australian singer-songwriter Ruby Boots and Heartless Bastards leader Erika Wennerstrom, for a pointed version of the late great Warren Zevon's ""Lawyers, Guns and Money.""Of course, you don't build a lasting empire like Nelson's without tending to the details. A highlight of this year's Luck Reunion was an on-the-bus listening party for Nelson's upcoming album Last Man Standing – which is terrific, equal parts heartfelt and funny, and often both at the same time. But the kicker was that Nelson's organization also used that listening party to unveil the new strain of Willie's Reserve brand marijuana, with a representative passing samples around the bus.Like the album, it's also called ""Last Man Standing.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203548.81/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325031213-20190325053213-00467.warc.gz

Held at the Country Music Hall of Fame with the lights of downtown Nashville serving as the twinkling backdrop, the SESAC Awards had a touch of old Hollywood glamour as the performing rights organization acknowledged writer affiliates who scored hits in country and Americana in the last year.

Singer-songwriter Lee Brice was part of a related presentation to the Folds of Honor organization.

Performer Kane Brown wasn't able to attend the SESAC Awards, but his presence was definitely felt. The Georgia native, who released his new album Experiment on Friday, was connected to all three of the major awards given out by the performing rights organization. ""Heaven,"" from the deluxe version of Brown's self-titled debut album, was named Song of the Year for its dominance on the charts in 2018.

And finally, Smackworks writer Matt McGinn was named Songwriter of the Year, having co-written ""Heaven"" along with other recordings by Florida Georgia Line, Cassadee Pope, Michael Ray and more.

21,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/2019-c2c-festival-review-chris-stapleton-806437/,"Headlining sets by Chris Stapleton, Lady Antebellum and Keith Urban, plus a vast range of impressive up-and-coming talent, highlighted the seventh annual Country to Country (C2C), Europe's biggest country music festival, this weekend.

Held over three days, the concerts took place at the 3Arena Dublin, Ireland; SSE Hydro in Glasgow, Scotland; and at London's O2 Arena, a packed venue that underscored the strong and still growing transatlantic appetite for country music. Like last year, Rolling Stone was in attendance for the London weekend of C2C. Here are the 10 best things we saw.

Keith Urban makes an overdue return.
For his first U.K. show in more than 10 years, Keith Urban knew had some time to make up, and he came prepared. The songwriter, vocalist and virtuoso guitarist turned in a high-octane set with hits like “Days Go By,"" ""Coming Home"" and ""Long Hot Summer."" The opportunity to be in front of a London audience again clearly meant a lot to Urban, who remedied his notable absence by getting up-close-and-personal with his crowd. On a walk-about through the audience, he presented a guitar to a young fan, a rock-star gesture of goodwill.



Cam sings about cheating, gets teary-eyed.
Cam delivered a joyful and empowering set on the opening night of C2C London, which happened to dovetail with International Women's Day. Kicking off with the pulsating, thundering intro that announces “Diane,"" Cam offered her unique spin on a cheating song. She also revisited her first U.K. hit, “My Mistake,” in an intimate living room setting — complete with couch and ambient lampshade — and played the spectacular “Palace,"" written with Sam Smith. ""London,"" she said tearfully, following the rapturous reaction to the encore ""Burning House, ""you're making my dreams come true.""

Ashley McBryde preaches perseverance. 
McBryde’s transition from 2018’s spotlight slot to the full arena stage this year reinforced the Grammy-nominated songwriter's career evolution: as she proved onstage at the O2, she keeps getting better and better. McBryde and her band opened with the stark tale of addiction “Livin' Next to Leroy,"" establishing early on that this would be far from a skin-deep country performance. Known for her ability to tell it like it is while weaving in moments that break the heart, McBryde left the audience spellbound with real-life stories of small triumphs, major losses and, with her tale of perseverance ""Girl Goin’ Nowhere,"" the strength to navigate both.



Lady Antebellum tease new music, cover Niall.
It’s been four years since the country trio last played C2C, but Charles Kelley, Dave Haywood and Hillary Scott were welcomed like old friends by the London crowd. “I Run to You” opened the final show of night two, with the band delivering exceptional harmonies and a slew of radio hits. Currently working on a new record, they revealed that the highly anticipated release had been cut in the studio just days earlier and introduced a brand-new song, a fierce love ballad that was warmly received. But the capper was an unexpected cover with some special guests: Hunter Hayes and Carly Pearce joining in to cover Niall Horan's “Slow Hands.""

Lyle Lovett gives a performance as big as his band.
Texas stalwart Lyle Lovett fused country with a heady mix of blues, soul, jazz, gospel and swing to provide the most diverse set of C2C. Joined by a brilliant team of musicians, Lovett announced to the crowd that they ""make the O2 feel like a living room"" before taking time to spotlight every band member, including vocal powerhouse Francine Reed. Her charisma, especially on “Wild Women Don’t Get the Blues,"" was the perfect accompaniment to the droll Lovett, who also paid tribute to Townes Van Zandt with a cover of ""White Freightliner Blues.""

Chris Stapleton proves less is more.
The final headlining show of C2C 2019 may be one of the most memorable in the festival's history. Stapleton’s stripped-back set astounded as the multi-Grammy-winning artist unleashed a powerful performance that showcased his full, extended range. Appearing with his core band of drummer Derek Mixon, bassist J.T. Cure and vocalist wife Morgane (pregnant with the couple's fifth child), Stapleton proved less can definitely be more in the right hands. From the first defining notes of “Midnight Train to Memphis,"" the Kentucky native had the audience at attention, seguing into “Nobody to Blame,"" before harmonizing beautifully with Morgane on ""Millionaire"" and ""Fire Away,"" their voices melding seamlessly together. It was Stapleton at his most exceptional.



Catherine McGrath raises her profile.
What a difference a year makes. Not only did this young Northern Irish singer-songwriter perform on the spotlight stage for the first time, she also made it onto the main stage alongside Hunter Hayes. Her debut album, Talk of This Town, recorded between Nashville and London, has earned her a diverse fan base — including Elton John — and songs like “Just In Case"" and “Wild"" proved she has the ability to connect with a whole new generation of country fans. At C2C, she raised her profiled yet again, notably with a dazzling reading of ""Don't Let Me Forget"" opposite Hayes.

Fairground Saints deliver California harmonies.
Sweet harmonies, laden with Americana and country influences, filled the O2's spotlight stage with the appearance of Fairground Saints. The California-bred, Nashville-based trio — made up of Elijah Edwards, Meg McAllister and Mason Van Valin — showed off elevated, innovative tunes, like the energetic, foot-stomping “Somewhere Down the Line."" While the new band's set was brief, the members' uncompromising attitude to making their brand of breezy music and a distinct Laurel Canyon vibe made the Saints instantly memorable.

Dustin Lynch commemorates his first-ever London visit.
Lynch’s London performance marked his first visit to the city, and he was eager to deliver. Raising a glass to thank the U.K. for the invitation, the charismatic Tennessee native took a moment to acknowledge the realization of playing the O2 stage. A country-tinged version of Adele’s ""Someone Like You"" was a hit with the crowd, while “Cowboys and Angels” – a tribute to his grandparents — was stunningly heartfelt. But it was an effortless, high-energy version of his Number One ""Small Town Boy"" that cemented Lynch as a star in the eyes of U.K. fans. “It’s my very first day in the U.K,” he announced. “We will never forget this night.""



Abby Anderson displays country commitment.
Armed with a big voice and exuberant stage presence, Anderson won over fans during C2C weekend. Celebrating her 22nd birthday, the singer-songwriter took to the BBC Radio 2 Stage to showcase songs off her debut EP I'm Good. Her bluesy, soulful influences were on display in tracks like “Dance Away my Broken Heart” and “This Feeling,"" which she performed on keys. It was honest, unfiltered star power, made all the more sincere when she took time to reiterate her commitment to country music.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202506.45/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321072128-20190321094128-00188.warc.gz

26,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/24-hours-with-hunter-hayes-country-upstart-breaks-live-show-record-249278/,"Making the Guinness Book of World Records is one of those pipe dreams that even the most famous musicians find irresistible. In November 2006, Jay-Z set the bar for most concerts in different cities over a 24-hour span when he flew his private plane to seven U.S. spots on his Hangar Tour. Six years later, the Flaming Lips passed that mark, playing eight Southern cities over the course of a day as part of the hoopla surrounding MTV&apos;s O Music Awards. One of the openers on that mini-tour? An up-and-coming country polymath named Hunter Hayes.
Summer 2014&apos;s 40 hottest tours
Hayes, whose second album Storyline came out on Tuesday, decided to one-up everybody: From Friday to Saturday he and a caravan of buses traveled down the East Coast on the Hunter Hayes 24-Hour Road Race, a marathon of 10 shows over 24 hours that aimed to break the Lips&apos; record and raise awareness about child hunger.
The bus portion of the trip totaled 408 miles over its nine destinations — Boston, Worcester, Providence, New London, New Haven, Stamford, South Orange, Asbury Park, and Philadelphia — and the rules were firm: more than half the cities had to have a population greater than 100,000 people; each city needed to be at least 31 miles apart; speeding tickets and law-breaking were prohibited; venues have to hold at least 300 people, and tickets have to be made available to the general public; and the artist has to play for 15 minutes, not including banter, each time out.
That was not a problem for the baby-faced Hayes, who packed venues at 12:45 p.m. (stop Number Three, the drafty Palladium in Worcester, Massachussetts) to 1:30 a.m. (stop Number Eight, the warm confines of South Orange, New Jersey&apos;s South Orange Performing Arts Center). His appeal to the gathered Hayniacs (yes, really) was easy to understand — his songs are twangily catchy, he knows how to uplift his audience, and he has a bubbly, affable charm that makes him seem simultaneously younger and more mature than his 22 years.
The strict parameters of the Road Race meant every movement was calibrated down to the millisecond. Hayes&apos; first notes rang out in New York&apos;s Times Square at 8:17 a.m. Friday and lousy weather in the Big Apple nearly derailed efforts early on, but he arrived at the Paradise Theater in time to not only hit his mark, but to set a pace that would result in him being as much as an hour ahead of schedule at certain points. ""It&apos;s pretty weird to do shows that are so quick. Usually we have a lot more gear,"" Hayes told the crowd in New London, Connecticut.
Hayes and his band switched things up from city to city, varying set lists and dropping in a few instrumental jams that showcased the prowess of everyone onstage. The ballad ""Wanted"" garnered screams from its opening chords, while Hayes&apos;s cheeky breakthrough single ""Storm Warning"" got the crowd moving every time. He invited audience participation, which both revealed how intently the crowd had memorized even the new songs&apos; lyrics and wisely conserved his voice.
Shows eight and nine — both in New Jersey — offered acoustic takes on the material he&apos;d been playing all day, and the South Orange Performing Arts Center&apos;s spectacular sound design rendered the material nearly sumptuous. Each venue offered its own unique charms, too: New London, Connecticut&apos;s Garde Arts Center is a rehabbed movie theater built in 1926, while the legendary Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey had guitars and posters from shows past hanging on the walls.
As 4 a.m. neared at the Stone Pony, Hayes&apos;s performance of his It-Gets-Better-core anthem ""Invisible"" was interrupted by an air horn and a declaration from the pair of officials tracking the festivities that Hayes had, indeed, broken the record. (Later, Hayes would tell a scrum of reporters that he&apos;d deliberately chosen ""Invisible"" for the award-presentation moment; its lyrical flipping of the titular word makes it nicely triumphant.)
""Let&apos;s go home!"" someone shouted giddily after the presentation was over, but Hayes and his bandmates would have nothing of it — not only did they barrel into the giddy jig ""I Want Crazy,"" with Hayes leading the crowd in hopping along, Hayes took the time on his way out of the venue to pose for photos with some fans who had been huddling near the stage door.
Day had broken by the time the caravan arrived in Philadelphia for the final concert. Before hitting the stage at the Trocadero — where, unconstrained by time limits and officially ahead of the Lips by two shows, he and his bandmates (and a few members of the opening acts) stretched the set to seven songs — Hayes stopped by the media bus to chat, his demeanor as effortlessly affable as it had been during the Good Morning America interview that preceded the journey 24 hours prior.
What was next? ""Everybody goes to bed,"" he told the assembled, laughing. But he and his bandmates couldn&apos;t hit the snooze button too many times. A trip to Japan beckoned, and it&apos;s hard not to think that heading overseas so shortly after breaking one record could put the spunky Hayes in mind of smashing another. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202781.83/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323101107-20190323123107-00260.warc.gz
27,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/5-amazing-and-possibly-apocryphal-willie-nelson-stories-236189/,"Willie Nelson just returned to the top of Billboard&apos;s Country chart with Band of Brothers, his first Number One album in nearly 30 years. It&apos;s just another accomplishment to add to the pile — after all, in his 81 years on this earth, Nelson&apos;s done just about everything. . . and lived to tell about it.

In the new issue of Rolling Stone, he&apos;s looking back at his career while still moving forward, with a never-ending tour schedule and plans for another new album, December Day. So in celebration of a life well lived, here are five Willie Nelson stories that are so amazing, they actually might be apocryphal. But like the old saying goes, never let the truth stand in the way of a good story.
The IRS Tapes T-Shirt IncidentYou&apos;re probably aware that in 1990, the Internal Revenue Service hit Willie with a $32 million bill for delinquent taxes – one of the largest ever served to an individual. After months of negotiating, Nelson and the IRS struck a deal: He&apos;d release a compilation of demos, outtakes and stripped-down tunes – appropriately titled The IRS Tapes: Who&apos;ll Buy My Memories? – to help pay down his tab.
The only problem? Turns out he was much better at dodging taxes than he was selling albums. During a promotional appearance on PrimeTime Live, Nelson wore a T-shirt with the number ""1-800-IRS-TAPE"" printed on the front, though, as fans who called soon discovered, that number actually belonged to a Salt Lake City-based company called Visual Technology. Luckily the owner of that company decided to let Willie lease his number so as to not disrupt the fund-raising campaign. Sales of the IRS Tapes would generate a reported $3.6 million, which eventually helped Nelson get square with the taxman.
The Time He Survived a Plane Crash This according to Willie&apos;s pal, promoter and scratch golfer Larry Trader:
""Willie was flying in to the landing strip near Happy Shahan&apos;s Western town that they used for the Alamo movie set. Happy is watching the plane coming in, knowing Willie is on it. The plane hits a big chughole in the strip and flips over on its side and crashes. Happy likes news and publicity, you know, so first thing he does is pick up the phone and call the radio stations, the TV, the newspapers. Happy says, &apos;Willie Nelson&apos;s plane just crashed. Y&apos;all better hurry.&apos;
""He jumped in a Jeep and drove out to the crash to pick up the remains. And here comes Willie and his pilot, limping up the road. The media people were arriving by then. They started firing questions at Willie. How did he survive? Was he dying? Was he even hurt? Willie smiles and says, &apos;Why, this was a perfect landing. I walked away from it, didn&apos;t I?&apos;""
The Nine-Hour Sex Marathon (with Somersault) During the depths of his tax issues, Willie also had other problems: Namely, a $50 million lawsuit filed by a woman who alleged he promised to marry her. . .and also claimed that the two had sex for nine consecutive hours, a marathon that was consummated with a backward somersault with her still attached. Naturally, the tale quickly became the stuff of tabloid legend.
In a 1991 Rolling Stone interview, Willie&apos;s first told his friend Kinky Friedman that it was ""the only true story written about him,"" though, when pressed, he hedged a bit:
""I&apos;m not saying it didn&apos;t happen,"" he told Friedman. ""It might&apos;ve. But you would&apos;ve thought I&apos;d remember at least the first four or five hours.""
The ""Shotgun Willie"" ShootoutWillie&apos;s a peaceful guy these days, but that wasn&apos;t always the case. For example, consider his response after learning that his daughter Lana was being assaulted by her husband, Steve:
""I ran for my truck and drove to the place where Steve and Lana lived and slapped Steve around. I told him if he ever laid a hand on Lana again, I would come back and drown his ass. No sooner did I get back to Ridgetop than here came Steve in his car, shooting at the house with a .22 rifle. I was standing in the door of the barn and a bullet tore up the wood two feet from my head. I grabbed an M-1 rifle and shot at Steve’s car. Steve made one pass and took off.""Of course, for reasons unclear, Steve came back for more. And Willie was waiting.""I ran out the garage door. Steve saw me and took off. That’s when I shot his car and shot out his tire. Steve called the cops on me. Instead of explaining the whole damn mess, the beatings and the semi-kidnapping and shooting and all, I told the officers he must have run over the bullet. The police didn&apos;t want to get involved in hillbilly family fights. They wrote down what I told them on their report and took off.""
The incident earned Nelson the nickname ""Shotgun Willie,"" also the title of his 1973 album. Of course, it wasn&apos;t the only time was caught in a shootout back in the day. There was also an infamous gun battle in the parking garage of the Birmingham Coliseum, where Nelson kept the peace wearing nothing more than ""cutoffs and tennis shoes"" and a pair of Colt .45 revolvers.
The White House Joint StoryThe Willie Nelson story to end all Willie Nelson stories. In 1980, he was invited to perform at the White House by then-president Jimmy Carter, then famously retired to the roof, where he supposedly smoked a joint.
Nelson&apos;s been asked about the incident countless times in the decades since, and he usually plays coy – though he also admitted to it in his 2000 autobiography, Willie – and in the new RS cover feature, he splits the difference:
""Oh, that might be true,"" he says. ""I forget.""
And that&apos;s the best thing about Willie Nelson: He&apos;s lived such an epic life that he forgets the things most folks tend to remember.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202324.5/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320085116-20190320111116-00449.warc.gz
28,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/5-minutes-in-texas-with-granger-smith-177976/,"There are two dudes living inside of country singer Granger Smith and both get their time in the spotlight on Smith&apos;s seventh studio album, 2013&apos;s Dirt Road Driveway. Tracks like ""Miles and Mud Tires"" and ""Bury Me in Blue Jeans"" represent the native Texan&apos;s good, clean, down-home way of life. But on Driveway&apos;s last two songs — ""Country Boy Love"" and ""The Country Boy Song"" — things get supersized: the Texas accent is dialed up to 11 and Smith&apos;s alter ego Earl Dibbles Jr. emerges.

Dibbles is a tobacco-chewing, overall-wearing, mud-stomping good ol&apos; boy character that Smith and his two brothers cooked up while goofing off with a video camera. After a YouTube clip featuring Dibbles going through his daily routine — putting in a ""dip,"" shouting his ""Yee yee!"" catchphrase, fishing — went viral, Smith decided to follow it up by actually writing some songs as Earl. Several million views later, Dibbles is a hit. (Watch Dibbles&apos; breakout video below.)
Smith always intended the Earl Dibbles Jr. character as a means for reaching potential fans of his own music, and now the singer&apos;s two projects are growing together. The singer says he has plans to release a six-song EP in the spring, which will feature five Granger Smith songs and one Earl Dibbles Jr. cut. There will also be a video for the Earl song, titled ""City Boy Stuck,"" and a full Smith LP in the fall.

As the hillbilly Jekyll and Hyde gears up for another leg of his Yee Yee Nation Tour, he spoke with Rolling Stone Country for our 5 Minutes in Texas series about his Texan influences, the camaraderie of the Lone Star State and, of course, the birth of Earl.
King George""I grew up listening to George Strait. I did, I did. He got me into it, and traveling around, following him. When I turned 16 and got a driver&apos;s license I was going and camping out, spending the night, getting tickets. I was a part of his fan club. So yeah, that was a big one for me.""
Tex Support""Texas is home to me. It&apos;s a big part of what I do and where I come from. It&apos;s been a big platform for me, especially the Texas Music platform, to have the charting system, and to have the touring system to get us out to where we are now, outside of Texas on the Yee Yee Nation Tour. In doing that I was playing in front of guys like Kevin Fowler and Roger Creager and Aaron Watson, and those guys really took me in. Especially Kevin Fowler, who really taught me how to sell merch and how to make T-shirts, and T-shirts that would sell better than others, and how to engage, and how to really embrace being an independent artist. When you&apos;re independent, it&apos;s not just the song, it&apos;s not just the show, but it&apos;s the complete package.""
Earl Had to Live""I believe the first [YouTube video my brothers and I] ever came out with was a video called &apos;Freddy&apos;s Enchiladas.&apos; It was a character named Freddy. And Earl was another one down this pipeline of, &apos;Let&apos;s make a funny video that has nothing to do with music.&apos; Earl did exactly what we always wanted — it went viral. It started getting millions of views, which was great for me, because it was so easy to become Earl — I&apos;ve got family members that are exactly like him. So it was easy to slip into that character.""
What a Wonderful Earl""We had people coming to our shows holding up signs saying, &apos;Yee Yee,&apos; &apos;Crack a cold one,&apos; &apos;Put a good dip in.&apos; And people were walking away from our shows with no satisfaction towards that video at all. It was a completely different entity. We realized we&apos;re crazy unless we come up with an Earl song.&apos; So I wrote &apos;The Country Boy Song,&apos; which was easy to write. It was just going down the monologue of Earl&apos;s day. We put out &apos;The Country Boy Song&apos; simultaneously with a music video, because we always wanted to make Earl visual. That song went even more viral than the first video, and that&apos;s when we knew, &apos;This has to be part of our show.&apos; It has been one of the greatest blessings and the most fun I&apos;ve ever had in music since then.""
Indie-Pendence""We started out [as an independent artist] because that was our only choice. We were on a tight budget, we didn&apos;t have a record deal and couldn&apos;t get a record deal, and we needed to play and put out music. So it was, &apos;Hey, I&apos;ll learn how to use recording software. And I&apos;ll bring my band in, we&apos;ll put some foam on the walls and see what we can do.&apos; That&apos;s really how it started 10 years ago. And it worked. We were able to sustain that and go out on the road a little bit, play some local places and sell an album. And then the next album was another step up. Now I&apos;m collaborating with a producer in Nashville named Frank Rogers (Josh Turner, Darius Rucker), who I&apos;ve known for a long time, on this new project. And we&apos;re doing a hybrid of half at my house and half with him. So that&apos;s been the next step in this process.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202506.45/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321072128-20190321094128-00284.warc.gz
29,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/5-minutes-in-texas-with-sam-riggs-177383/,"When Sam Riggs chose to follow his dream of being a professional musician, picking up and leaving his native Florida, he had a decision to make: Nashville or Austin. He ultimately elected to settle in the Texas capital, citing its reputation as an incubator for original talent. Since then, he formed Sam Riggs and the Night People and released his full-length debut, 2013&apos;s Outrun the Sun.

It&apos;s a Red Dirt record, full of wide-open ballads and mid-tempo country-rock, with songs about taking leaps of faith, overcoming shattered hearts and letting go. It&apos;s also an album colored with more than a few shades of Riggs&apos; influences — including Garth Brooks and Riggs&apos; mentor, Texas country rebel Ray Wylie Hubbard.
Earlier this month, Riggs released a video of a solo performance of his new song ""Second Hand Smoke,"" which will be included on his as-yet-unnamed follow-up to Outrun the Sun, due later this year. (Watch the video below.) ""It&apos;s a song about addiction, pure and simple,"" Riggs says of ""Smoke."" He admits he has struggled with addiction at times in his life, and in characteristically soul-baring fashion, he&apos;s unafraid to discuss those struggles in his lyrics.
In Rolling Stone Country&apos;s latest ""5 Minutes in Texas"" series, Riggs talks about the influence of Hubbard and Reckless Kelly, the cinematic music video for ""When the Lights Go Out"" and his Star Wars-themed line of merch.
Ray of Light""[Ray Wylie Hubbard&apos;s wife Judy] sort of quasi-managed me for a short time through some struggles I was going through. And I met Ray via her. And Ray and Judy kind of became my magical, musical godparents, so to speak. I think Ray saw that I was in a malleable place in my musical career and songwriting, and he jumped on that and set me in the right direction, in terms of just writing real lyricism, really putting out songs that you&apos;re proud of, that you don&apos;t mind singing for 30 years. It helped me to redefine my sound, or find my sound in general. I think I was really searching for myself for a while there, and when you get a nod from someone like Ray, it&apos;s really empowering.""
Reckless Abandon""A friend of mine who was running a ranching operation out of Crockett, Texas, would drive back and forth from Florida. And he came back with a [mix] CD — it had some Reckless Kelly on it, some Randy Rogers on it, things like that. And [Reckless Kelly&apos;s] &apos;Wicked Twisted Road&apos; was on that CD, and that song really spoke to me. I think at that time I sort of idolized them. The sound that I wanted was that sound. I wanted a sound that really didn&apos;t bow down to anybody. You weren&apos;t going to find it in the Top 40 pipeline.""
Go Garth or Go Home""Growing up, [Garth Brooks] was a beacon for me. Sort of the lighthouse in the fog. I always followed that kind of idea that he had. Like, we have a limited amount of time on this earth, and you have an exponential reach with your music if you chose to. [With Garth,] there was no box. There were no lines. He went way outside of where you ever thought he was going to go. &apos;Standing Outside the Fire,&apos; he took that video in a completely left-field [direction]. And &apos;The Thunder Rolls&apos; obviously was amazing, and &apos;The Red Strokes.&apos; So many different songs, and the videos were just off-the-wall and awesome.""
Cowboy UpRiggs&apos; video for ""When the Lights Go Out"" is a spooky look at the death — and afterlife? — of a dead bull rider. ""I wrote this story, sort of a continuation of the [late bull rider] Lane Frost story, for the video. I wanted a video that, by the end of it, people had chills down the back of their neck. We didn&apos;t stop until we did it. And that was me on the bull. I used to ride for a short time in high school. Very amateur. But I wanted people to believe it. I didn&apos;t want a stunt double.""
Second-Hand Addiction""I think everybody is addicted to something in life. But more often, people are addicted to someone more than something. And that&apos;s exactly what &apos;Second Hand Smoke&apos; is about. The [character in the song], it&apos;s like he&apos;s always involving himself with things that kill him. And her love is really no different. At the end of the song, he decides it&apos;s just a habit he&apos;s never going to be able to break, because every time he gets around her, he&apos;s got to have her again. Just like second-hand smoke.""
May the Merch Be With You""I&apos;m a huge dork. I don&apos;t watch TV, but I&apos;m a big cinematic fan. I love Star Wars, I love Lord of the Rings, I love Harry Potter and stuff like that. It&apos;s just fun to watch a cool, surreal world. When we were designing koozies [to sell at the merch table], we stumbled across the Star Wars theme, and it just sold like hotcakes. It was, &apos;Well, nobody else is doing it, so let&apos;s do it.&apos; I&apos;ve been waiting on a cease-and-desist order.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202188.9/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320004046-20190320030046-00242.warc.gz
30,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/5-things-we-learned-from-sturgill-simpsons-marc-maron-podcast-189550/,"Fans of Sturgill Simpson have been getting a look into his diverse musical self with the three very different solo albums he&apos;s released since 2013 — High Top Mountain, Metamodern Sounds in Country Music and his latest piece of counter-country, A Sailor&apos;s Guide to Earth. But Simpson has always been guarded when it comes to his personal thoughts, so his appearance on Marc Maron&apos;s influential WTF podcast today was a revealing treat.

Maron is famous for wide-ranging, in-depth and often hilarious interviews with big names in pop culture, including everyone from President Obama to Louis CK and Gary Shandling, and he got Simpson to open up in a way that the singer-songwriter has been reluctant to do in the past.
Here are five things we learned from Simpson&apos;s visit to the WTF podcast:
1. A Sailor&apos;s Guide to Earth was intended as an actual life guide for Simpson&apos;s 2-year-old son.  Conceptually it&apos;s a letter from a parent to a child, and the narrative was laid out before Simpson even had the songs finished. Sailor&apos;s Guide starts with a ""birth"" of sorts, then moves on to what a child might expect in the modern world, before concluding with an uplifting message to not be afraid of death. It also drives home the point that we&apos;re all surrounded by love, even when it doesn&apos;t seem like it. During the album&apos;s ""teenage"" section, Simpson wasn&apos;t sure what to say since he spent those years in a self-described haze, until his wife suggested covering a song from his adolescence: Nirvana&apos;s ""In Bloom.""
2. Simpson has confidence issues.Much like one of his musical heroes, Marvin Gaye, Simpson struggles with stage fright. ""People think I&apos;m pissed off onstage, but really I&apos;m scared shitless and trying to fight through it. Entertaining is an aspect I&apos;ve had to get a grip on,"" Simpson told Maron. ""Marvin could put out &apos;Let&apos;s Get It On&apos; and sell five million copies so he didn’t have to tour, but you have to now. The only way I&apos;m going to support my family is to tour. I love playing, don&apos;t get me wrong. That 90 minutes every night, that&apos;s free. We get paid to travel. But every night I have to get myself locked in. There are a thousand people that don&apos;t want to be disappointed because they have a lot of expectations.""
3. The cover art to Metamodern Sounds in Country Music was a joke.""That was me being a smartass. I wanted to make the tackiest album cover of all time and juxtapose it with the tin-type photos that were going on at the time, but even a more ancient version of it, so it’s a painting of a black and white photo on a space background,"" Simpson revealed. ""It&apos;s all a joke — the title is Metamodern Sounds in Country Music. I&apos;m paying homage to Ray [Charles], but I needed to take myself a little less seriously at the time because [High Top Mountain] was such a serious record.""
4. He predicts a coming wave of mainstream ""authentic country"" artists.""People were fed up with what they saw as a lack of recognition for &apos;authentic country,&apos; but I knew [I] wouldn’t change anything. I got the &apos;Savior of Country Music&apos; title and knew they would be let down,"" Simpson said. ""The industry propagates things it stands to benefit from and I knew the change had to come from the inside. A guy like me or Jason [Isbell], we can kick down doors all day but we&apos;re not going to be the ones to walk through them. . . . [The industry] is welcoming in new ones like Chris Stapleton. . .but both fortunately and unfortunately I think in the next few years you&apos;re going to see Music Row pumping out versions 1 through 37 of their &apos;authentic country singers&apos;"" because they know right now they kind of look like assholes.
5. He takes some responsibility for country parody artist Wheeler Walker Jr., the alter-ego of comic Ben Hoffman. ""I introduced Ben Hoffman to Dave Cobb [who produced Walker&apos;s album Redneck Shit] because I was like, &apos;This kinda has to happen.&apos; But I told him, &apos;You can&apos;t puss-cake out halfway through. You can&apos;t tiptoe, it&apos;s gotta be full fucking [Andy] Kaufman or I don&apos;t ever want to see you again.&apos; It was on the Billboard country chart, which I think is fucking brilliant. It needs to be made fun of and I don&apos;t just mean the mainstream. People get so hung up on, &apos;This ain&apos;t real country&apos; and it&apos;s like, &apos;Who fucking cares?&apos;""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202450.64/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320170159-20190320192159-00176.warc.gz
31,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/8-things-we-learned-hanging-out-with-jon-pardi-189724/,"It&apos;s fitting that Jon Pardi begins his brand-new California Sunrise album with a track called ""Out of Style."" The song is actually about writing a song: It begins with a budding artist moving to Nashville and getting songwriting advice, only to find once he puts his pen to paper that it&apos;s not about chasing any sort of trend. Instead, he waxes poetic about the oft-forgotten common threads that weave generations, such as the notions that ""Jesus saves"" and ""beer&apos;s better cold."" But the underlying, more personal message is that Pardi&apos;s signature sound of classic country with a modern beat has stood the test of time, no matter what sorts of sonic experimentation dart in and out of the airwaves. ""It may never see a bullet in a Billboard magazine, but then I&apos;ve never been the kind to go out chasin&apos; smokin&apos; guns,"" he sings atop a pedal steel and drums-driven melody made for two-stepping.

Don&apos;t get him wrong. Pardi wants to be played on country radio just as much as any Luke, Blake or Jason, and he delivers high-energy country with just enough rock & roll to fit in. But keeping his new tunes rooted in the classic country sound he&apos;s always loved — California&apos;s Buck Owens meets Texas&apos; George Strait — is something from which he&apos;ll never waiver, Billboard be damned.
We met up with Pardi after an acoustic performance in Nashville to talk about the new album, which he recorded live with a seven-man band. He also told us some funny stories from the road and let us in on a few skeletons from his musical past. Here are eight things we learned from our chat.
He&apos;s one of the most classic-country-leaning artists on contemporary radio. . . who admires Sam Hunt and Florida Georgia Line. ""You can&apos;t be an old grumpy person!"" exclaims Pardi, ruminating on country music&apos;s wide-open sonic doors. ""I like hearing fiddles, steel guitar, acoustics up loud — really rock & roll stuff but with a country sound behind it. That&apos;s just who I am. I&apos;m not trying to prove a point; I am just doing what I like. But I don’t have any problems with any other artist coming in and doing their own thing. Like Sam or Florida Georgia Line — they&apos;re just doing their own thing. Country music wouldn&apos;t be where it&apos;s at right now if it wasn&apos;t for guys like Florida Georgia Line and Sam Hunt. And when [fans] get sick of those guys, they&apos;ll wanna listen to my record! [Laughs]""
He once won a songwriting competition with a musical P.S.A. While studying at Chico, California&apos;s Butte Junior College, Pardi entered a contest challenging musicians to write a song denouncing driving under the influence. He won with ""The D.U.I. Song"" — a foot-stompin&apos;, honky-tonkin&apos; look at a ""regular guy with a D.U.I."" ""It went over great live — it&apos;s fun and catchy,"" Pardi recalls, admitting a bit of guilt over crafting a rowdy tune with such a serious topic. ""But it did have a good theme: don&apos;t drink and drive! It was kinda stupid, but it got the word out."" Pardi&apos;s prize was $300 — money he used to buy a rack for his band&apos;s P.A. system.
He drinks responsibly. He&apos;s just 31 years old, but Pardi insists he&apos;s already done a lot of growing up when it comes to liquid temptations on the road. ""It used to be, get a good buzz and go out [on stage]. Now it&apos;s a little more like, I&apos;m getting older, I need more vocal warm-ups, drink more water,"" he reveals, going on to explain that his band&apos;s idea of ""fun"" on tour is really just to keep on working: ""We&apos;re just a bunch of guys sitting around playing music for fun. We&apos;re always jamming.""


His musical growth over the years is all about the miles. . . and the ears. ""I listen to people,"" Pardi humbly answers when asked how his music has evolved from album to album. He&apos;s a formidable guitar player, but hires other guitarists to take the lead in the studio. And he watches both tourmates and himself when on the road, learning through osmosis how to be a better picker and tunesmith.
He likes gas station cuisine. That ""every guy"" persona Pardi has going on is not an act. When we realized we had a friend in common, Nashville filmmaker Reid Long, the singer reacted with a really random story of the two on the road: ""I was eating eggrolls at a gas station, because I&apos;m that kind of guy,"" he remembers with a laugh. ""And Reid said, &apos;Wow, I&apos;ve always looked at those eggrolls and thought, &apos;Who eats those?&apos; Now I know.&apos;""
His ""Head Over Boots"" video re-creates the song&apos;s inspiration. The clip&apos;s opening scene of an elderly couple waltzing across a Texas dancehall represents a real-life couple that mesmerized Pardi on one of his many trips to the Lone Star State. ""I was watching an older couple two-stepping at a dancehall. And I was like, &apos;Man, I&apos;d really like to have a song that you can two-step to that also has a lyric about love and staying together.&apos; The next morning, I came up with the head-over-boots melody and a few dummy lyrics and then took them to [co-writer] Luke Laird.""
The title track, ""California Sunrise"" is no ""Sweet Home Alabama."" A native of Dixon, California, Pardi typed the words ""California sunrise"" in his iPhone&apos;s ""SongBook"" a long time ago, wanting to eventually write a tune that encapsulated a lot more than just his home state&apos;s natural beauty. ""I wanted to write a shout-out to the West Coast, but not in a, &apos;California&apos;s the best! No one else is better!&apos; way,"" he insists. ""It&apos;s a romantic story that tells the beauty of California and the beauty of a relationship.
""We wanted to write a cool, California-country sounding song,"" he continues. ""We had the Bob Segers and Jackson Brownes and Glen Freys in mind — that heavy acoustic and bouncy sound, but in a modern style.""
With California Sunrise, he feels the chart pressure. Pardi&apos;s 2013 single ""Up All Night"" hit the Top 10 on the country radio charts and was certified gold, for sales of more than 500,000. Two other singles from his debut album, Write You a Song, went Top 30, while a fourth hit the Top 40. And he&apos;s a glass half-full kind of guy, reasoning that, ""We got four Top 40s total from that record, and that was perfect for me.""
But then came 2015, when a surge of new singers swooped into the genre and created more competition. ""All these new artists are coming out and everyone&apos;s getting Number Ones. And then there&apos;s me, with no Number Ones. So everybody&apos;s looking at that, and you sit down to do your second record knowing [that with] all these new guys, the pressure is on,"" he laments. ""I had a full record of songs I wrote, but we really wanted the best record we could so we turned to Nashville, to the publishers, to the songwriters and we listened to a thousand dirt road songs. And man, we&apos;ve got &apos;Up All Night,&apos; we&apos;ve done that. So we made a record that sounds just like me, where I am now and where we wanna be at country radio. We are a mainstream traditional act and really want to get played on the radio. . . and take over the world. [Laughs] """,crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202450.86/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320190324-20190320212324-00264.warc.gz
32,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/9-to-5-turns-35-and-its-still-radical-today-50499/,"December 19th marks 35 years since the release of 9 to 5, the cult comedy that brought together Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin with Dolly Parton in her film debut as Miss Doralee Rhodes, a kind-hearted secretary who fantasizes about lassoing her ""sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot"" boss and roasting him on a spit.

Tomlin stars as Violet Newstead, a working widow and mother of four who&apos;s passed over for promotions despite her obvious qualifications. The project was conceived of by Jane Fonda, who was inspired by the work of Karen Nussbaum, an old friend from the anti-war movement and founder of 9to5, an organization still in the business of advocating for working women. Fonda cast herself as the uncharacteristically mousy Judy Bernly, a nervous divorcee who can&apos;t figure out who she is, never mind how to run the copy machine. Sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot boss Franklin Hart Jr. is played to smarmy mustachioed perfection by Dabney Coleman.
The plot of 9 to 5 feels nothing short of radical, even (and perhaps especially) today. Mr. Hart spends his days harassing Doralee by telling her she&apos;s much more to him than ""just a dumb secretary."" He lies about sleeping with her, and purposefully knocks pencils on the floor so she&apos;ll lean over and pick them up. He insults Judy, and bullies Violet by demanding she fix his coffee. After learning she lost out on a promotion to a man she trained, Violet confronts Mr. Hart. ""Spare me the women&apos;s lib crap,"" he replies.
Mr. Hart is soon made to pay. After a coworker gets canned for comparing salaries — technically a protected activity since the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 — Violet, Judy and Dolly head to the bar to drown their sorrows in birdbath-sized martinis, smoke a joint and spin revenge fantasies about their boss. The next day, Violet accidentally stirs rat poison into Mr. Hart&apos;s coffee. Hijinks ensue, and eventually they kidnap him.
In order to hide the fact that they&apos;re holding their boss hostage, the women have to run the business as best they can, which, it turns out, is much better than Mr. Hart. They implement flexible schedules and a job-sharing program, set up a daycare center and ensure equal pay.
These themes were all very timely in 1980, the same year the EEOC issued guidelines clarifying that sexual harassment is unlawful under Title VII (though it didn&apos;t become a nationally discussed issue until the Anita Hill hearings a decade later). But the thing about watching 9 to 5 today is that you realize the American workplace of 2015 is nowhere near as progressive as Miss Doralee Rhodes and company were way back in 1980.
The gender pay gap was nearly the same in 1980 as it was in 1960. The gap narrowed in the Nineties, then stalled. If progress continues at the current rate, American women won&apos;t achieve pay equity until 2059. This is the only advanced nation in the world that doesn&apos;t provide paid parental leave. The annual cost of putting a baby in daycare typically costs more than a year&apos;s tuition in state college, one of many factors driving women out of the workforce.

With movements like Fight for $15 and Raise the Wage, these workplace equality issues are part of the national political conversation. Recently there&apos;s been a focus not just on sexism in U.S. workplaces, but also in Hollywood, as actresses speak out about equal pay and advocates point to the opportunity gap for women working behind the lens.
With all that in mind, Rolling Stone spoke to Patricia Resnick, who wrote 9 to 5&apos;s original screenplay – it was subsequently revised by the film&apos;s late director, Colin Higgins – about her original plans for the female characters in the film, being a woman in Hollywood, and clueless male journalists.
You did background research for 9 to 5 by spending time with office workers at Fox Studios&apos; insurance company. Do you recall any specific people who inspired the stories in the film?This is actually the genesis of Doralee, the Dolly Parton character. There was the head guy&apos;s secretary. I had spent some time with some of the other secretaries first before talking to her, and nobody liked her. Everybody had a bunch of awful things to say about her, and they said she got to be his secretary because she was sleeping with him, and on and on. I finally went out to lunch with her one day, and she had a couple of martinis and her tongue got pretty loose and she started telling me about her life, and she started crying. She was a really nice woman, she was living with her mom and taking care of her, and she knew everybody thought she was sleeping with the boss, and she said she wasn&apos;t. That gave me the idea for that character.
Did you already know that role would be played by Dolly Parton?We had Jane for sure, because it was her idea to do the film and it was her production company. It was written for Dolly and Lily, but we did not have them under contract. We really wanted them, but we did have some backup ideas in case they turned us down.
For Lily, it was Carol Burnett, and for Dolly, it was Ann-Margret. But I had Dolly, Lily and Jane in my head the whole time, and we were really hoping that&apos;s who it was going to be.

You wrote the screenplay, and then when Colin Higgins was signed on to direct, he reworked it. How did it change?I had written a very dark comedy in which the secretaries actually tried to kill the boss, although they tried to kill him in sort of funny ways. Originally, Jane had been concerned that would be too dark. I screened an old Charlie Chaplin film called Monsieur Verdoux for her. In it, Chaplin&apos;s wife is blind and he has a child. He&apos;s kind of a Blackbeard, he romances a series of woman through the course of the movie and murders them in order to get money and support his family. It is a comedy, but at the end they hang him. I turned to Jane at the end of the movie and tears were rolling down her cheeks – but she was concerned the women wouldn&apos;t be sympathetic enough. I said, ""He really killed all these women and you&apos;re crying. I just want them to try! They won&apos;t be successful."" And she said OK. But then when Colin came in, he was very influenced by Warner Bros. cartoons and things like that, and so their attempts to kill him became the fantasy scenes, and he made it a much broader comedy.
Did you spend time on set?When I worked with Altman, he had the writers on set through the entire production and I thought that&apos;s the way that Hollywood worked. When Colin Higgins came in on 9 to 5, I had one meeting with him, and he basically said, ""I write by myself. I&apos;m not going to write with you. I believe there&apos;s one captain on set and that&apos;s the director. I don&apos;t want the actors going to you instead of me, so if you want to visit on set once and have lunch, that&apos;s fine.""

That was the way he worked, and it was really heartbreaking. I think I cried every night for a couple of weeks. When I went to the first screening I felt like I had a kid, and the kid was sent off to military school and came back two years later, and I was squinting and going, ""I guess it&apos;s kind of my kid."" It was really very painful, but that&apos;s, unfortunately, how it goes with writers in features: you don&apos;t own copyright, they can fire you, they can replace you they can change the director. That was a very hard lesson to learn.
Hilariously, the New York Times review called it ""a militant cry for freedom."" I can&apos;t imagine the response if they had actually attempted to kill the boss, or if it was a serious movie about workers&apos; rights.Jane had piles and piles of documentation about clerical workers, but she knew she wanted a comedy because it would make the social message more palatable. 

It&apos;s an interesting question, what kinds of media can affect social change. We&apos;re having a big feminist pop culture moment, but I often wonder if it translates beyond ""raising awareness.""
It&apos;s hard to know what to do. In some ways we&apos;ve definitely moved forward a little bit, but there does seem to be a lot of sentiment in this country, in one of our political parties, that seems to be trying to undo what little we&apos;ve been able to do. The other thing that makes it difficult is that so many people think that this is all been settled. We did a musical of 9 to 5 on Broadway in 2009, and it was really frustrating because a lot of the interviews that I did with male journalists, the first thing they said was, ""Well, none of those issues are a problem in contemporary life, so how are women of today going to be able to relate to it?"" I thought, yeah, you can&apos;t sexually harass someone as obviously. We don&apos;t call people ""secretaries."" Other than that, what has changed? People would kill to work from 9 to 5.
What was it like being a female screenwriter in the late Seventies?I don&apos;t know what it&apos;s like to be a male screenwriter, so it&apos;s hard for me to know in what way my career would have been different. I do know that I very much wanted [writing and directing feature films] to be part of my career trajectory, but even after the tremendous success of 9 to 5, that was not going to happen. I think a lot of that, if not all of it, had to do with being female. I know a lot of the conversation right now is primarily about the lack of female directors, but female writers are not doing that much better. In terms of screenwriting, the last two years I believe the small percentage has gotten even smaller. In terms of television, which is somewhat better for women, [the percentage of women] is still quite small.
Do you have particular war stories, or was it more of a silent bias?It just wasn&apos;t going to happen. I would say, ""I&apos;d like to direct,"" and everybody would sort of smile, and that was kind of that. The one anecdote I do have is I was seven months pregnant with my first child when I directed a short film, and I won an Award for Cable Excellence (ACE) Award. Then a powerful female producer said to me, ""Well, you can&apos;t plan on directing with a baby,"" and I said, ""I can direct with a baby."" And then I realized soon after that, particularly because I was a single parent, I really couldn&apos;t. I mean, I could have, but it wasn&apos;t something I was going to pursue at that time. My career changed, and I had to think about things I don&apos;t think men have to think about. I ended up having two kids on my own, and by that time features had really kind of dried up for me, I think it was combination of age and gender. I just couldn&apos;t get work. I started by reluctantly doing television, which I actually came to love.
I appreciated how the recent New York Times Magazine&apos;s article about this issue began with a story about a young man in Hollywood reminding an older man of himself.That comes down to mentoring, men helping bring along other men. There weren&apos;t that many powerful women who could bring along younger women, and I know possibly it&apos;s getting better now, but certainly when I was doing features, women producers, especially executives, it&apos;s almost like they were afraid to push for a woman writer. If it didn&apos;t go well, it would be on them for pushing for a woman, whereas if they got a guy and it didn&apos;t go well, oh well, it just didn&apos;t go well. It wasn&apos;t because it was a guy writer.
Now it seems like women are more willing to work with women. I&apos;m going in projects where there seems to be more than one woman in the room, and seeing female producers bringing in female writers and partnering with other women. I was really fortunate to be mentored by Robert Altman, and yet he didn&apos;t let me write until Lily Tomlin let me write.
There&apos;s buzz about a sort of 9 to 5 reunion by way of Dolly Parton appearing in a guest spot on Grace and Frankie. Any inside scoop?None! People would love to see the three of them together again. For years there was talk of a sequel or a remake, but as Dolly always says, ""It&apos;s 9 to 5, not 95!"" Doing a remake with them, that ship has probably sailed. There&apos;s certainly enormous goodwill and affection toward that movie. It&apos;s amazing that this many years later it&apos;s as known and as loved as it is, and that&apos;s a wonderful thing. I only wish that it was more antique and vintage in its politics than it is.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203865.15/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325092147-20190325114147-00291.warc.gz

The show will take place on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. The celebration will be broadcast to U.S. troops serving around the world via the American Forces Network, and on National Public Radio stations across the country.

""I am beyond thrilled to be a part of the Capitol Fourth celebration,"" says Linsey. ""What better way to celebrate America&apos;s independence than on the lawn of the Capitol? It&apos;s incredible. As an American, I couldn&apos;t be more honored. I&apos;ll be checking this off of my bucket list for sure!""
The eclectic singer, who finished in the runner-up position during Season Eight of NBC&apos;s The Voice in May, debuted her original single ""Change My Mind"" during part one of the show&apos;s finale, noting that the song was indicative of the ""soulful, pop direction"" she is moving toward musically. ""Obviously, it was a big power ballad, Linsey tells Rolling Stone Country. ""I&apos;ve got some more upbeat, sassy, fun songs up my sleeve. I sent Blake [Shelton] a ton of songs, and that was the one he thought was the best one for the show and for the single. I didn&apos;t even know Blake was going to be the one picking the song! I actually wrote that song with two of my best friends, Julie Moriva and Dee Briggs, and my boyfriend, Tyler Cain produced the track that they released. My friends played on it, my friend mixed it, so it was a great opportunity for everybody around me to have that moment.""
The 35th anniversary of A Capitol Fourth marks the country&apos;s 239th birthday. Hundreds of thousands of people flock to Washington, D.C., every year to see the show. Other performers will include Bradley Whitford, KC and the Sunshine Band, Lang Lang, Ronan Tynan, Robert Davi, Jack Everly and several military bands and choral groups.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204969.39/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326095131-20190326121131-00382.warc.gz
34,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/a-little-bit-country-and-a-whole-lot-everything-else-228380/,"Hooking one single to backing vocals lifted from Sam Cooke, invoking Marvin Gaye on another, Thomas Rhett is a different kind of country star – at least different from the twang-metal cowboy he played on his debut album three years ago. Think of him as an R&B lover-man, unfurling songs about getting loose on vacation or in the club – what’s the difference? ""This is the groove that gives you swagger and gets you talking real smooth to a lady,"" he promises on ""Anthem,"" the opening cut on Tangled Up, before making way for guitars that might as well be EDM synths. At times the corn runs too high, but the sound is unusually rhythym-forward, and it works. While these songs are specific about their sense of place, musically they’re polyglot – those mentions of Georgia and Tennessee are a pledge of fealty that allows the music to go anywhere.
That’s how Cam works it on Untamed, a major-label debut that opens with crickets, a train whistle and harmonica, then zips off into booming drums and stratospheric vocals. The expert gloss comes in part from co-producer Jeff Bhasker, who’s worked with Kanye West, Lana Del Rey and Bruno Mars. Jack the bass on standouts like ""Hungover on Heartache"" and ""Burning House"" and they’d be ready for Pink, another Bhasker client.
By comparison, Brothers Osborne are traditionalists – but that riff in the opening track of Pawn Shop sure sounds familiar. Could it really be from Elvis Costello’s ""Pump It Up""? Maybe. Produced by Jay Joyce, who helped Eric Church plot his country-rock insurrection, Pawn Shop works an expansive version of Americana that connects Lynyrd Skynyrd to U2 and Merle Haggard to Bob Seger.

The Southern-rock-influenced group, rounded out by bassist Graham Deloach and guitarists Bill Satcher and Zach Brown, worked with producer Dann Huff (Keith Urban) for the new song, the first taste of their upcoming album.

The Southern-rock-inspired foursome of Michael Hobby, Bill Satcher, Graham Deloach and Zach Brown scored their first Number One in 2015 with ""Smoke"" — a rare chart-topping debut from a group with more than three members — and released the riff-heavy album Southernality to wide acclaim. 

Earlier in 2016, they were recognized with an ACM nomination — their first — for Top New Vocal Duo/Group but missed the news while catching up on sleep.
""I woke up to a text from my buddy,"" recalls singer Hobby. ""He said, &apos;Congrats man. Way to go!&apos; I literally was like, &apos;What are you talking about?&apos; He was like, &apos;Your ACM nomination.&apos; I immediately got on the Internet.""
A Thousand Horses started out the year on Jason Aldean&apos;s We Were Here Tour and will resume their supporting duties (along with Thomas Rhett) in late April. They previously spent time with Darius Rucker playing large venues, but this spring and summer they&apos;ll be taking their full band — including three gospel-slanted backup singers — to sports stadiums like Fenway Park behind Aldean.
""I just think it gets you more excited and more fired up to get out there and rock it,"" says Hobby. ""It&apos;s a dream come true.""
""And we&apos;re always trying to push forward too,"" agrees Satcher. ""So the show this year is different than it was last year. Every show we play, we try to figure out how we make it that much better.""

""In real life, you can't just delete the thread.""It's a lot harder, even, to delete a song, something that the East Nashville-based songwriter thought a lot about as he wrote the music that would become Karma for Cheap, his third album: about the value of speaking out, reaching across the aisle and doing the work in hopes of a better, more kind future. He also pondered the importance of acting now, not later, on ""If Not Now When,"" the LP's opening track premiering exclusively on Rolling Stone Country. ""So many people are feeling right now that the desire for change is so prevalent, myself included,"" says Tasjan, who wrote the record after Trump was elected under a sense of growing unease.  ""But it's on the tip of your tongue and in the air, and we can almost feel it happening. We're just waiting for the boulder to get pushed off the cliff, so it can roll down into the valley. And that song felt like a good opening statement: 'Hey man, let's get on the bandwagon and party one more time, because if we don't make all that can be made from this moment, I think we'll look back and feel truly bad about it.'""""Working some holes in your shoes, trying to get over the news,"" Tasjan sings before breaking into a riff that evokes classic Beatles guitar work like that of ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)."" ""It's nothing but a reason to lose."" Tasjan's no closet Beatles fan – the Fab Four shaped his youth and inspired him to be an artist – and it's no accident that Karma for Cheap conjures up the John Lennon classic ""Instant Karma!"" either. Here, Tasjan lets those influences, along with a background in glam-rock bands like Semi Precious Weapons and New York Dolls, form something dreamy and determined, anchored in experimental and psychedelic rock & roll. ""I wanted to try and be a cheerleader to the people who are on the front lines of all this stuff."" And as with ""If Not Now When,"" Karma for Cheap strives to cut a balance between rallying cry and sonic escapism, finding a sweet spot that focuses on how to handle and digest the here and now. Songs like ""The Truth Is So Hard to Believe"" contemplate our terrifying reality where something doesn't have to be true to be worthy of retweets, and ""Crawling at Your Feet"" grasps at whatever sense of danger weighs us down. It's not explicit protest music, but it's not shutting up and singing, either. ""How can you do both at the same time anyway,"" Tasjan says. ""To shut up and sing would be to defy the laws of physics! If someone can figure that out, they should definitely put a patent on it.""Tasjan would never heed to ""shut up and sing,"" anyway, but Karma for Cheap is less about tearing things down than building them up, and giving a voice to those working tirelessly for change. ""I wanted to work really hard lyrically to create a record that wasn't drawing lines in the sand from a humanitarian point of view,"" says Tasjan. ""Trying to say something that's more of a comfort, and to try and be a cheerleader to the people who are on the front lines of all this stuff. To my gay friends, to my transgender friends, to my friends who are women, to my friends of various ethnicities. I wanted to make a record that had some good in it, and to try and do something that could help to comfort somebody or uplift somebody.""Tasjan recorded Karma for Cheap at a studio in his friend Gregory Lattimer's Nashville house, with whom he also co-produced the record alongside Jeff Trott. He tried out some fancier, more traditional studios first, including one at Sheryl Crow's house, but nothing seemed quite right. ""I guess I feel more comfortable in a dirty garage,"" Tasjan says. On his last record, 2016's Silver Tears, Tasjan pushed for room for ""subversive art"" in Americana music, and Karma for Cheap is even less concerned with genre borders, finding inspiration from Tom Petty, David Bowie and, yes, the Beatles. Tasjan's encouraged by how little the Nashville creative community seems to care about making music that fits neatly into boxes, and recalls recently talking to Margo Price about how free she felt to make whatever sort of record the muse might lead her to, even if it veered more rock & roll.  ""It's refreshing to know those people are out there, and a lot of them seem to be coming from Nashville,"" says Tasjan. ""The ones making those breakthrough records and then not being afraid to go back on the next record and change their sound, and write about something different.""Tasjan's certainly not afraid to push his sound, nor explore difficult subjects: like karma, which never comes cheap. ""It's the golden rule, 'do onto others as you would have them do unto you,'"" he says. ""You can't achieve that by giving your email out, and you can't get that at a discount in some easy way. But that's why it's worth doing, damn it."" Karma for Cheap will be available August 31st via New West, with Tasjan kicking off the Karma for Cheap Tour in September.

Tasjan has announced a follow-up release, Silver Tears, whose mix of cosmic cowboy folk-rock and acid-influenced pop doubles as his first album for New West Records.Recorded in Southern California with producer Eli Thomson, Silver Tears tips its hat to Golden State icons like Harry Nilsson and Tom Petty. The album&apos;s cover appears to be a tribute, too, with a photograph of Tasjan that recalls Dwight Yoakam – caught mid-stride as he walks beneath a cloudy sky, Tasjan&apos;s suit is bedazzled with what appears to be the shining shards of a crushed disco ball. The songs, though, are Tasjan&apos;s own, fueled by melodies whose simplicity doesn&apos;t lessen their punch.""Drive"" chugs forward with the bright bounce of the Traveling Wilburys, while ""Refugee Blues"" mines darker influences, soaking Tasjan&apos;s guitar bends in pools of reverb.

39,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/aaron-lee-tasjan-on-breaking-the-americana-mold-micro-dosing-lsd-105188/,"It&apos;s just shy of noon on a Friday, and Aaron Lee Tasjan is at a bar on the east side of Nashville, showing off his weed socks. Well, technically, it&apos;s a barbeque joint – but, for the purposes of this particular day&apos;s festivities, we&apos;re calling it a bar. Packed with tourists carrying trays of pulled pork and jalapeno cornbread, it&apos;s the fifth stop on what Tasjan has called his ""12 Bar Blues,"" an event inspired by a track on his second album, Silver Tears. The stunt has the Ohio-born singer hopping from watering hole to watering hole to celebrate Silver Tears&apos; release day. A blue, 25-seater Grayline bus is parked outside, serving as everyone&apos;s ride for the day – including label folk, some fans and friends – with its driver, Buddy, now taking a break inside for a basket of fries. The socks in question – black, with fluorescent marijuana leaves – are a small bit of flair in Tasjan&apos;s unusually subdued ensemble. Today, it&apos;s a leather jacket, jeans and hat, though Tasjan doesn&apos;t shy away from the gaudy: on the cover of Silver Tears, he&apos;s sporting a gleaming suit with quarter-sized sequins and a polka-dot shirt, and he&apos;s been known to go equally glitzy for his stage performances. Because Tasjan, who used to play guitar in Manhattanite glam bands Semi Precious Weapons and New York Dolls, is not afraid of mixing subversion, satire and a little bit of spunk into his look. He&apos;s certainly not afraid to mix it into his songwriting either, which, on his debut LP In the Blazes, established him as a left-of-center scribe in the Americana culture, one more interested in tickling the intellect than stabbing at the heart.  Silver Tears, his first release with new label New West, shows how he can bend his point of view to be both poignant and punching: sweeping arrangements or rambling drinking songs, like ""12 Bar Blues,"" share space with a Harry Nilsson-esque ode to getting high that&apos;s as sticky as the bud he sings about, with nary a cheap-shot sentimental love tune. And in a musical climate where a man&apos;s machismo is often hung at the bottom of a very earnestly grown beard, this point of view is not always easy to digest. But, if you ask Tasjan, that&apos;s the point.  ""We were just playing in St. Louis and they had posters from the album cover up in the bathroom,"" Tasjan tells Rolling Stone Country a few days later, calling from a tour stop in Columbus. ""I had gone to use the bathroom and I was washing my hands, and below where there is the picture of me in the sequin suit someone had written, &apos;Really dude?&apos;. It was so awesome. So I took my Sharpie out and drew a little heart around it. That&apos;s great, and that&apos;s how it should be. I think effective art does draw some lines and challenges people to feel some way about it. And it may not always be the warm fuzzy reaction you hope for. But that&apos;s OK.""Americana music does tend to rely quite often on the ""warm and fuzzy"" – intense, suspender-sporting banjo players are certainly not in short supply these days – but that sort of old-timey pastiche is exactly what Tasjan isn&apos;t. His boots aren&apos;t precisely scuffed oxfords: they&apos;re gold-flecked sparklers with a bit of a heel (with, lest we forget, some suitably flamboyant socks). The music&apos;s like that too. Instead of leaning on modern folk conventions and dreary tales scraped along the concrete by a weepy fiddle, Tasjan favors quirk, narrative detail and a stilted humor, often all in one song. It&apos;s what keeps his fingerprint so strong (even through influences like Nilsson, Roy Orbison, John Prine and Tom Petty) across Silver Tears. ""There is a lot of precedence put on earnestness,"" Tasjan says of Americana. ""And some of our flag-bearing artists are more stoic performers, if you will. Which is interesting to me because a lot of them are very funny in real life. And they take what they do very seriously. It&apos;s not to say I don&apos;t take what I am doing very seriously, but I think there is room for subversive art in Americana music."" When Tasjan arrived in East Nashville in 2013, the most recent folk revival was chugging to full tilt. His side of the river was just starting to capture the national spotlight, and many musicians that roamed its streets were more intent on making their audience members cry than laugh.  As a commentary, he wrote the song ""E.N.S.A.A.T"" – ""East Nashville Song About a Train"" – which effectively psychoanalyzed an entire subculture without rousing any actual ill will. Perhaps because it was so incredibly self-aware.The track ended up on In the Blazes, which he released on his own in 2015, and soon after began the material that would become Silver Tears – a good bulk of it while ""micro-dosing"" on LSD, a way of getting high that has the user taking small hits throughout the day so as to never get fully inebriated but never really sober, either. ""It&apos;s a little like walking over to the edge of the cliff and peering down and maybe kind of hanging your feet over the edge, but you never quite fall off,"" he says. ""I wrote &apos;Ready to Die,&apos; &apos;Little Movies,&apos; &apos;Dime&apos; and &apos;Where the Road Begins and Ends&apos; one day doing that. It was the turning point."" Tasjan, who has opened for Ray Wylie Hubbard and John Moreland, recorded the songs in Los Angeles and signed with New West to release it – a label which he chose partly for their tolerance for his out-of-the-box ideas, such as this ""12 Bar Blues"" event. It wasn&apos;t the first (and won&apos;t be the last) creative presentation of his music. Just this past fall, Tasjan was flanked by two drag queens at his Americana Music Festival set – and his outfit, for the record, was probably the flashiest of the three. Two stops before the barbeque joint, the big blue bus pulled up outside of Fanny&apos;s House of Music, a local instrument shop in the heart of East Nashville. Buddy, after parking, jammed on a guitar inside (he used to play piano at the Grand Old Opry), and someone grabbed Tasjan a most perfect gift from the shelves – a copy of AC/DC for Ukulele, a metaphor so appropriate it almost seems planted (it wasn&apos;t). Soon, Tasjan headed outside to the steps and started playing ""Dime,"" a song from Silver Tears that sounds like a train chugging towards the cosmic corral, with the Wilburys traveling inside and Brian Wilson at the wheel. But here, stripped of all the production, it&apos;s anchored only by his ace fingerwork and closed-eye smile. Dressed down, without all the glitter and gloss, it still shined.

40,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/aaron-lewis-on-controversy-being-too-country-and-future-of-staind-121607/,"Aaron Lewis revels in irony. The 44-year-old singer, who once appeared on the cover of High Times magazine holding a bong, arrives for an interview sporting a narcotics law-enforcement cap. Equally ironic is the fact that the frontman for the hard-rock group Staind just released one of the most country-sounding albums of the year. Titled Sinner, and produced by Buddy Cannon (Kenny Chesney), the record debuted at Number One on the Billboard Country Albums chart, knocking Jason Aldean&apos;s They Don&apos;t Know out of the top spot. All of this with minimal country-radio airplay of Sinner&apos;s lead single, ""That Ain&apos;t Country."" (Watch the video for the song below.)Like the outspoken New Englander who wrote and performs it, the song takes aim at today&apos;s polished, sometimes vacuous, country music. Lewis introduced the song at a biker rally in Colorado earlier this month as his answer to those who are ""choking all the life out of country music."" But he didn&apos;t stop there: he named names, citing Luke Bryan, Sam Hunt and others for churning out material that, to his ears, wasn&apos;t in tune with the genre&apos;s roots.Lewis eventually clarified his remarks on The Bobby Bones Show, but he refused to capitulate, digging in his boot heels about the definition of country. In a candid interview with Rolling Stone Country, Lewis further shares his thoughts on the format, the future of Staind and how Kid Rock reintroduced him to country classics.To what do you attribute the success of Sinner?I have a really loyal fan base. There can be speculations made on other things, but I&apos;ll let other people make those speculations.Are some of those fans also Staind fans?Yeah, I think there is some Staind crossover. And I think there are some people that love Staind that want nothing more than for me to come back to rock. And then there are people out there who want nothing more than for me to stop making music altogether. You just can&apos;t make everybody happy.With Sinner, it&apos;s clear that you&apos;re a dyed-in-the-wool disciple of outlaw country and twang.I&apos;m old enough to remember and appreciate the country music that defined the genre. I skipped everything else. I stopped listening to country around the time that Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton were taking over. And I was able to choose the music I wanted to listen to, and as most kids do, I rebelled against the music I was forced to listen to as a kid. That took me down a road of having being lucky enough to have a career in rock music. But that doesn&apos;t change the fact that country music was the first music I ever heard. It doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not the soundtrack to every good memory that I have as a child. So that&apos;s the country music that I&apos;m calling on, that is in my soul. I don&apos;t know the other country music. I don&apos;t recognize what fills up a lot of the airwaves on country radio as anything that came from the country music that I grew up on.How did you reacquaint yourself with the music you heard as a kid?Through the ultimate rebel, Kid Rock. I was spending many nights without sleep on his tour bus and we were listening to all this classic country. And every song that would come on had a memory from my childhood attached to it. Once that happened, I really couldn&apos;t escape the inevitable, which is where we are now.Sinner&apos;s first single ""That Ain&apos;t Country"" makes clear your view of today&apos;s popular country songs.I&apos;m not saying they&apos;re not good songs, I&apos;m not saying they&apos;re not catchy. I&apos;m not saying that I&apos;m not stuck just like everybody else singing them all day if I hear them earlier in the day. That&apos;s not what I&apos;m saying. I&apos;m simply questioning the connection between that and the music that defined the genre.Is that disconnect more in the sound or the lyrics?It&apos;s the sound and it&apos;s the lack of meaningful heartfelt lyrics. It&apos;s a lot of the same thing. There are times where I&apos;ve sat there listening to the radio and a song by five different artists plays on the radio and the song never changes. Like to the point where I know that the program directors have to be careful of putting particular artists back to back, because they sound so much alike. It&apos;s a long slippery slope of a conversation and I&apos;ve teetered on that slope about as much as I&apos;d like to.We heard a program director once called you ""too country""…A program director? My first time around, it was one of the most popular things I heard. For Town Line and The Road. They loved the record and thought it was one of the countriest records they heard that year, but they couldn&apos;t play it because it was too country.There is some irony there.Ya think?Yes, but also in the way that you&apos;re a rock singer who is making country that can&apos;t be played on country radio. Which, it can be argued, is the home of rock today. As you say, the songs on country radio all sound the same, and we can draw the parallel back to when that was happening in the late Eighties and early Nineties, pre-Nirvana.Sure. It happens in cycles with every genre. When the music that is popular in culture pushes the limits too far from the core of what defined the genre, it always snaps back like a rubber band and goes back to more roots-driven material. Then slowly but surely it goes further and further away from its roots until it gets to that point where it has to snap back again. It&apos;s with every genre, even pop, even Top 40.But you have to be around long enough to recognize it.Yeah. I&apos;ve had a record deal for almost 20 years.Your lyrics on Sinner are often dark and introspective. Is that the way you prefer to write?I&apos;ve always written from that vulnerable place and really put things out there that most people wouldn&apos;t. I learned that there is really no topic that you can&apos;t write or sing about or express, from Jonathan [Davis], the lead singer of Korn. Hearing that first Korn record hit me like a freight train, and I cried at the end. I love that man with all my heart. He is my grandfather in the music business, because they found Limp Bizkit and Limp Bizkit found us, so I guess in some way that makes him my grandfather. But that&apos;s how I&apos;ve always written. I have to try much harder to write a song like ""Endless Summer"" than I do to write a song like ""I Lost It All"" or ""Sinner."" As weird as it may sound, my comfort zone is writing about the things that are deep and dark and torturous.You called into The Bobby Bones Show recently to explain your comments about those who were ""choking the life out of country."" But Bones did credit you for having an opinion in an industry that often doesn&apos;t share opinions.I would like to think that all of these amazing songwriters that are collected here in Nashville would really rather not be churning out one homogenized mediocre song after another. I don&apos;t think they want to be doing that. I think they&apos;re doing what they need to do. It&apos;s one big vicious circle and it&apos;s nobody&apos;s fault. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the industry&apos;s fault, radio&apos;s fault, the artists&apos; fault. I think the fault lies in the combination of all three, and everybody being afraid to voice their opinion.So is Staind on hiatus?We haven&apos;t broken up. I have no interest or creative need to go there right now. I&apos;m pretty focused on [country music] and I&apos;m not going anywhere. This is what feels right at this point in my life. Do I think there&apos;s room somewhere down the road for Staind to play shows in the summertime, radio festivals and stuff like that? Sure. Do I think I have another one of those records in me? Of course I do. All I have to do is live.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201996.61/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319143502-20190319165502-00372.warc.gz
41,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/aaron-lewis-preps-new-full-length-album-sinner-237770/,"The debate over what constitutes country is one that dates back decades, but singer Aaron Lewis has decided to jump right into the contentious fray with his new song ""That Ain&apos;t Country."" It&apos;s the first release from the Staind front man&apos;s forthcoming solo album Sinner — his first with Big Machine affiliate Dot Records.

Produced by Buddy Cannon (George Strait, Kenny Chesney), ""That Ain&apos;t Country"" makes use of a Nineties Alan Jackson-style shuffle with Telecaster twang and liberal steel to fire its poison arrows at unspecified contemporary targets. Using the perception that all modern country is about feeling good and that all classic country is about desperation, Lewis sets up his thesis: ""That ain&apos;t country. That&apos;s a natural fact. It&apos;s full of tales of good times and happy endings and my life ain&apos;t like that."" Later, he name checks Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, David Allan Coe and a list of other male stars he finds to be the essence of country. Hear it below, via Spotify.
Sinner is already available for pre-order and will be digitally released on July 15th. Lewis wrote or co-wrote nine of the 11 tracks on the album, which also includes versions of Chris Stapleton and Lee Thomas Miller&apos;s ""Whiskey and You"" (recorded for Stapleton&apos;s Traveller) and Bruce Robison&apos;s ""Travelin&apos; Soldier (recorded by the Dixie Chicks for Home). Willie Nelson also makes an appearance on the title cut.
Here is the Sinner track listing: 1. “Sinner” (featuring Willie Nelson) (Aaron Lewis) 2. “That Ain’t Country” (Aaron Lewis) 3. “Whiskey And You” (Lee Thomas Miller, Chris Stapleton) 4. “Northern Redneck” (Aaron Lewis) 5. “Mama” (Aaron Lewis) 6. “Sunday Every Saturday Night” (Aaron Lewis, Ira Dean) 7. “Lost And Lonely” (Aaron Lewis) 8. “Story Of My Life” (Aaron Lewis) 9. “Stuck In These Shoes” (Aaron Lewis) 10. “I Lost It All” (Aaron Lewis) 11. “Travelin’ Soldier” (Bruce Robison) ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201922.85/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319073140-20190319095140-00519.warc.gz

""That being said, I want to thank a few people for inspiring me to write this next song.""The singer for the chart-topping 2000s hard-rock group Staind, who will release his second country solo album Sinner on September 16th, went on to ""thank"" country-radio stars from Luke Bryan to Sam Hunt for spurring on his anti-pop-country song ""That Ain&apos;t Country."" ""Whatever happened to the country songs / full of truth and consequences, all the things gone wrong,"" he sings in the pre-chorus, ""someone came and changed it up, made it all a lie.""""I&apos;d like to thank Sam Hunt – oh, I know, he&apos;s so pretty to look at,"" said Lewis onstage. ""I&apos;d like to thank Luke Bryan, for most of his stuff – he surprises me every once in a while. I would like to thank Dan + Shay. I&apos;d like to thank Cole Swindell. And every other motherfucker that is just choking all the life out of country music.""Lewis&apos;s comments come on the heels of Sturgill Simpson&apos;s August 29th Facebook screed, which took the Academy of Country Music and the Nashville establishment to task for co-opting the name of Merle Haggard while, he believed, doing little to further traditional country music. Lewis&apos;s new album Sinner leans heavily on outlaw-country themes and steel guitar and includes songs like ""Northern Redneck"" (Lewis hails from New England), ""Whiskey and You"" (a Chris Stapleton cover) and the title track, which features a guest vocal by Willie Nelson. Alison Krauss, Dan Tyminski and Vince Gill also appear on the album, which will be released on Dot Records, an imprint of the Big Machine Label Group.

Fresh from releasing a live album and a Christmas album in 2018, Watson is currently prepping Red Bandana, his first collection of new material since 2017's Vaquero. ""Kiss That Girl Goodbye"" makes for a foot-on-the-gas intro to the new material, as Watson leads the sing-along vocals over a careening mix of fiddle, banjo, and handclaps. ""If he really wants a goodbye kiss, you tell him to go kiss it where the sun don't shine,"" Watson sings with gleeful, love-'em-or-leave-'em sass.
Due out this year on Watson's own Big Label Records, Red Bandana follows in the footsteps of two highly acclaimed LPs for the Texas veteran, after 2015's The Underdog topped the country charts and Vaquero landed at Number 10 on the Billboard 200 — both without the help of a major label.
Watson kicks off his 2019 tour schedule by playing Schroeder Dance Hall in Goliad, Texas, on January 11th.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202728.21/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323060839-20190323082839-00559.warc.gz

Vaquero, a Spanish term popular in the southwest for one who drives cattle, follows Watson&apos;s history-making album The Underdog, which became the first independently issued set by a male artist to top Billboard&apos;s country albums chart in early 2015. Vaquero will hit retailers and online outlets February 24th.Co-produced by the artist with Marshall Altman, who has helmed LPs for Frankie Ballard and Eric Paslay, among others, the album&apos;s 16 tracks were all written or co-written by Watson, with contributions from Mac McAnally, Leslie Satcher and Kendell Marvel, among others. Last month, Rolling Stone Country premiered the first single from Vaquero. The propulsive ""Outta Style"" finds Watson covering more contemporary country terrain than he has previously, but still celebrating his Lone Star State roots with the playful ""Amen Amigo"" and the life lessons of the album&apos;s accordion-driven title track. Now in his 17th year of making records, Watson defied the odds with his aptly titled LP The Underdog, which also earned a Top Ten berth on the multi-genre Billboard 200 in its first week of release. ""What we&apos;re doing right now is pretty much a &apos;David versus Goliath&apos; kind of situation, because I&apos;ve never been embraced by the music industry,"" Watson told Rolling Stone Country after that LPs unprecedented success. ""There&apos;s only so many times you can be told you&apos;ll never make it.

She was dancing. He was playing. Fifteen years later, they've built entwining careers — as well as a family — upon that initial encounter, touring the world together as a Grammy-winning, husband-and-wife folk duo.

The new video for ""Take Me to Harlan"" finds Fleck and Washburn revisiting the dynamic of their first evening spent in one another's company. In the clip above, Fleck's banjo provides the soundtrack for his wife's clogging. She stomps, jumps and drags her feet against the ground, underscoring her vocal melody with an old-world Appalachian rhythm. Joining her are members of the dance troupe Pilobolus, whose headlamps cast stark, startling spotlights upon Washburn's face during the video's intro — a cover of the Depression-era union song ""Come All You Coal Miners"" — and whose legs work up a sweat during the song's dance-heavy final stretch. Meanwhile, Fleck kicks up plenty of dust on his own, throwing claw-hammered riffs and jazz-influenced passing tones into his banjo playing. The result is a modern-day spin on age-old traditions, merging original roots music with classic choreography.

Recorded at Pilobolus' studio in rural Connecticut, the ""Take Me to Harlan"" clip also cycles its way through a reel of casual highlights from the musicians' ongoing tour in support of their second album, Echo in the Valley. They make gas station runs. They unload the van. They tend to their toddler-aged son, who's been touring with the couple ever since he was born. Equal parts home movie and performance art, ""Take Me to Harlan"" connects the dot between the family's time on- and off-stage.

The country singer, actor and dad to famous pop stars is seated in a room in the Nashville home and studio of the late Cowboy Jack Clement, but his mind is time traveling back to 1992, when one of the most polarizing songs in country music, ""Achy Breaky Heart,"" was dominating the airwaves.When he gets his answer – that the writer was speeding away from his senior year of high school in an '84 Chevy Cavalier, with ""Achy Breaky Heart"" blaring on the local Top 40 station – the Kentucky native howls in delight. It's the memory of the car that gets him. You see, Cyrus – or whatever he's calling himself these days – loves cars. His landmark debut album, Some Gave All, which turns 25 years old this month, was practically birthed in one. Prior to cutting the record that would change his life, debuting at Number One on the country albums chart and spending 17 weeks atop the Billboard 200, Cyrus was living out of his own Chevy, a stuffed-to-the-rear window Beretta. ""I was pretty comfortable in there. But my car had shit all over it. Well, not shit, though there was probably some of that too,"" he says. ""There were cassette tapes, and tapes, and tapes. And guitars, and microphones rolling around the floor. If I needed anything, all my shit was in that car. That was my office.""Those tapes that filled the backseat of his Beretta were his memos. Cyrus loves cassettes and brings them up often in conversation. They're a connection to a time gone by for the 55-year-old singer, an era when future hits could be discovered by simply pressing ""play"" on some unknown songwriter's hastily recorded demo. It was on cassette, in fact, that Cyrus first heard songwriter Don Von Tress' ""Achy Breaky Heart"" – then titled ""Don't Tell My Heart.""""I stood up and said, 'That's me! That's what I want to sound like, that's what I do, man!'"" Cyrus says, shooting up from his chair and thrusting his hands in the air. ""Thinking back on it, it just turned me on because it moved me.""Although Some Gave All was nearly finished, Cyrus returned to the studio to cut this silly new sing-along, a track that its own writer Von Tress says was ""a gift from the ether. I saw kids dancing in my mind [when I wrote it] and I remember telling my wife that and she thought I was a little screwy.""Cyrus jettisoned one of his own compositions, ""Whiskey, Wine and Beer"" – ""The best move I ever made in my life!"" – and slapped ""Achy Breaky Heart"" onto his new album for Mercury Records.The song was a monster, knocking Sawyer Brown's ""Some Girls Do"" out of the top spot on the Billboard country charts the week of May 30th, 1992, and remaining there for five weeks. But to some, ""Achy Breaky Heart"" was just monstrous. Travis Tritt criticized the song as signifying a wrong direction for country music, leading Cyrus to offer a bizarre rebuttal onstage at the 1993 American Music Awards. ""There have been those people perhaps due to paranoia or insecurity or perhaps they consider theirself [sic] a self-proclaimed critic … To those people who don't like 'Achy Breaky Heart,' here's a quarter, call someone who cares,"" he said, alluding to Tritt's own 1991 hit.Waylon Jennings also raised an eyebrow at Cyrus' hip-swiveling dance steps that accompanied the song.""Waylon had said, 'I think the boy's tennis shoes may be a little too tight,'"" remembers Cyrus, who went on to became close friends with the outlaw country pioneer. Still, ""Achy Breaky Heart"" had its unexpected fans. Von Tress recalls hearing the song's merits as a ""true American folk song"" debated on NPR, and cites a near mythic Bruce Springsteen cover of his tune. ""Springsteen said, 'I don't care what anybody says, this is a damn good song,'"" recalls Von Tress. Sure enough, Springsteen did spontaneously run through ""Achy Breaky"" at a tour rehearsal show in 1993 in New Jersey.Despite, or likely because of, its love-it-or-loathe-it nature, ""Achy Breaky Heart"" keeps on beating. Cyrus just released two new versions and performed the ""Muscle Shoals"" update on NBC's Today Show. The original, meanwhile, remains a touchstone of Nineties country. It's also that rarest of gifts an artist can receive: a signature song. One that Cyrus still delivers honestly every time he strums those A and E chords.""Somebody was bitching back when it was released that that is just what country needs, another three-chord song,"" he says. ""I said, ahem, 'It's only two.'""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204086.87/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325174034-20190325200034-00154.warc.gz

On October 2nd, the Memphis R&B singer was on tour in Australia when she woke up to the news of a mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas. Just four days later, after a 19-hour flight, she was scheduled to perform on the opening day of the first weekend of ACL, the first major music festival to take place after Route 91.""As my plane was landing in Los Angeles, it hit me: 'Wow, I'm going to play a music festival,'"" June recalls. ""I got a little anxious. I didn't really know what I was feeling before. I had just been a little bit snappy and sassy and short-tempered.""June wasn't the only one on edge in the lead-up to ACL Fest, which was expected to draw as many as 75,000 people per day from Friday to Sunday. ""I've been a wreck all week,"" admitted Gordy Quist, singer and guitarist of Austin's Band of Heathens, who, like June, performed on Friday at ACL Fest. ""This has been a terrible week, thinking about this stuff. Everything that went on was horrific.""Earlier in the week, festival organizers offered refunds to ticket buyers concerned over safety, while the Austin Police Department announced an increased security presence, including additional help from federal law enforcement and the Texas Department of Public Safety. But for June, her fears were assuaged before she ever set foot on the festival grounds at Zilker Park.""I said, 'I'm called. This is what I came here to do,'"" June says. ""As artists, we're called in our way to create and share something beautiful in the world. People ask me a lot, 'Is that enough, or should you be yelling and holding a protest sign?' And I do really think it's oftentimes enough to create something beautiful and give people space to come together."" Quist agreed, describing his band's appearance at ACL as a ""middle finger"" to Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock, who killed 58 people and injured more than 500 on October 1st while Jason Aldean was headlining the final night of Route 91.Lukas Nelson, who also performed on Friday at ACL Fest with his band Promise of the Real, was more pointed. ""If anything, it made me want to go out and play music more,"" he said of the domestic terror attack. ""I feel like the media and everybody else wants to make a big deal about it, they want to make people afraid or something. I don't even like the conversation. Of course I'm going to go out there and do what I do. We don't let anybody with a gun try to dictate our sense of freedom, our playing music and spreading love and celebrating life.""From the artists' perspective onstage, the specter of violence didn't seem to hurt attendance. ""If anything, it was more crowded than it's ever been. I was shocked by how many people were there,"" says Quist, who has played ACL several times before. ""My biggest fear would be that nobody comes to the festival because we're all afraid.""ACL Fest attendee Logan Cassidy traveled from Ohio to attend the festival, and walked around carrying an American flag and a sign that read, ""End mass shootings, we're not afraid of you."" ""The day after [the Las Vegas shooting] happened, my mom texted me and said, 'Maybe you should reconsider going to this music festival.' I thought about it a second and felt the complete opposite. I can't live life in fear, I can't let these guys win,"" says Cassidy, who had originally planned on only attending the second weekend of the festival, set for October 13th through 15th, but purchased a ticket for weekend one in the aftermath of the shooting. Other fans, like Austin natives Dave and Andrea Pittard, felt comfortable enough to bring along their daughter in a stroller. ""I'm not going to let one or two crazies pressure me from going and having a good time with my family,"" Dave Pittard says. Increased security measures helped put them at ease, his wife added. ""The police department said they'd set up heightened security and increased perimeters. It seemed they were at least being proactive, so we felt comfortable bringing our family,"" she says.While ACL is an urban festival, there are some key differences between its layout and that of Route 91's near the Las Vegas Strip. The festival grounds are contained within Zilker Park, a relatively secluded space across the Colorado River from downtown Austin. Vehicle access is tightly restricted and there are none of the high-rise buildings like those from which Paddock conducted his sniper-like attack – a method of assault that was also used in Austin in 1966, when Charles Whitman opened fire from a clock tower perch on the University of Texas campus, killing 16 people and an unborn child.""Austin was the first city that I'm aware of that ever had a mass casualty event from a shooter atop an elevated position,"" says Austin Chief of Police Brian Manley, who is more concerned with large numbers of fans leaving the secure confines of the festival grounds at one time. ""We've taken care of [safety] when the crowd is inside,"" he says. ""What's been alarming over the past couple years is people using vehicles as weapons, simply plowing into crowds.""The extra vigilance with security made for noticeable backups at entrances, although fans typically reported waits of only a half hour, and barely noticed the security presence once inside. ""They've done a good job. It's a terrific balance this year especially. I feel safe and I'm having a great time. It just makes me concerned about where it could eventually go,"" says Beau Redfield, who recently moved to Texas from Wisconsin and was joined by several friends for the festival. He's worried about security becoming too restrictive. ""When you ramp up security for a festival like this, it impacts on your ability to feel free. It's counterproductive.""Chief Manley doubts that the Las Vegas mass shooting will lead to significant changes in festival security, although he thinks it's significant that the Texas state troopers reached out to offer their services at ACL Fest this week. ""I think you may see more types of law enforcement that didn't traditionally help at these events recognize that they can help local law enforcement agencies keep everyone safe,"" Manley says.Nelson believes there's only so much that can be done. ""Having good security is important, but honestly I'm inclined more to believe that if somebody really wants to do something, they will,"" he says. ""How do you stop that from happening? You'd have to create a police state.""Sergeant Michael Crumrine has worked security at ACL Fest for Austin PD ever since the first festival in 2002, but he doesn't see recent events a change from the norm that has developed in the past decade and a half. ""Every year since 9/11, and since everything that's happened with domestic and international terrorism, it's just a part of life now. Is that sad? Yes,"" he says. He doesn't see that affecting fans for the most part. ""Some people seem like they're on edge, but I've had more people come up to say, 'Thank you, you make me feel better more than other years.'""June says she felt the same sense of appreciation from being onstage and is looking forward to coming back for the second weekend of the festival. ""It was good to be around each other in that kind of environment listening to music and trying to share something we can all enjoy, no matter what our belief or race might be,"" she says. ""I looked out at the crowd and was just super grateful that people's hearts aren't closing.""In fact, the biggest impression made on fans and artists like Quist and Nelson was from the various ACL Fest tributes to Tom Petty, who died on October 2nd. Prior to Spoon's set on Saturday night, a trio of skydivers parachuted onto the grounds while the jumbo screens all showed footage of Petty and the Heartbreakers' performing ""Free Fallin'"" at ACL Fest 2006.""Everywhere you go, you hear Tom's music playing. So instead of feeling afraid, you feel uplifted,"" says Nelson. ""That's what music's for, especially Tom's. You don't have to live like a refugee. We don't have to live in fear of these fuckers.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202324.5/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320085116-20190320111116-00403.warc.gz

The country queen took home three trophies at Sunday&apos;s Academy of Country Music Awards, including a record fifth straight win as Female Vocalist of the Year.
The 2014 ACM&apos;s 13 Best & Worst Moments
""I cannot believe this; I really didn&apos;t expect it,"" said the denim-clad singer upon besting Sheryl Crow, Kacey Musgraves, Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood for the Female Vocalist honor. ""I was just hanging out with Trisha Yearwood back there – holy crap! And I was standing next to Sheryl Crow, a complete and utter rock star. Kacey Musgraves, she wrote the Single of the Year. Carrie Underwood&apos;s my buddy; she&apos;s a phenomenon."" 
That Musgraves-penned, Lambert-delivered Single of the Year is the musical spitfire, ""Mama&apos;s Broken Heart."" Keith Urban shares the country singer&apos;s third win of the evening, Vocal Event of the Year, for their duet, ""We Were Us."" He also shares bragging rights as the night&apos;s top winner, as he collects two trophies for ""We Were Us,"" as artist and producer of the song, along with Video of the Year for ""Highway Don&apos;t Care,"" his catchy collaboration with Tim McGraw and Taylor Swift.
While Urban and Lambert led in numbers, it was George Strait who took home the night&apos;s top trophy, Entertainer of the Year. This follows the King of Country&apos;s victory in the same category at the CMAs last November – both sweetly sentimental wins in that the 61-year-old music icon is retiring from touring after his current Cowboy Rides Away trek. 
""I&apos;ve always said I have the best fans in the world, and I heard this was a fan-voted thing, so I rest my case,"" quipped the legendary singer from the ACM&apos;s Las Vegas stage.
The only other fan-voted award of the night was perhaps the night&apos;s only controversial moment. The 2014 ACM New Artist of the Year is Justin Moore, a singer who first hit the country airwaves in 2008. With three albums now under his belt, including two gold-sellers, the Arkansas native actually does not qualify for the New Artist title under the ACM&apos;s rules that ""any solo artist that has sold 500,000 copies of a previously released album … [is] not eligible for this category."" The Academy explained that, in some cases, there are exceptions to the rule.
A grateful Moore, who stands about 5&apos;6"", made light of the situation in his acceptance speech, joking, ""I was beginning to think there might be a height requirement for this award.""
Jason Aldean stands tall with his second snag in a row of Male Vocalist of the Year, while Vocal Group of the Year went to first-time winners, The Band Perry. Predictable victories included Florida Georgia Line for Vocal Duo of the Year and critic darling Kacey Musgraves for Album of the Year. Jessi Alexander, Connie Harrington and Jimmy Yeary – the songwriters behind Lee Brice&apos;s ""I Drive Your Truck"" – took home Song of the Year honors.

Miranda Lambert is one of the double ACM victors, taking home Female Vocalist (for the seventh consecutive year) and Vocal Event of the Year, for her ""Smokin&apos; and Drinkin&apos;"" collaboration with Vocal Group of the Year winners, Little Big Town.

""It's been a rough year. Thanks to everyone who reached out and showed love and support to us, it meant a lot to us,"" he said, accepting his trophy. ""To my Route 91 people, you guys are in my hearts always, love you guys. And we love Las Vegas, Vegas strong. Thank you."" Aldean, who was onstage during the Route 91 Harvest festival shooting, was visibly emotional as he spoke. Elsewhere, Miranda Lambert won her ninth consecutive Female Vocalist of the Year trophy, while Chris Stapleton triumphed in the Male Vocalist category. Stapleton's From A Room: Volume 1 was also named Album of the Year at the ACMs and Lambert's ""Tin Man"" won Song of the Year. ""Thank you for sharing my broken heart with me,"" Lambert said, accepting the award with co-writers Jack Ingram and Jon Randall. The track is a highlight of Lambert's double album The Weight of These Wings.Brothers Osborne and Rhett Akins were early winners at the awards. The sibling duo won their second consecutive Vocal Duo of the Year ACM trophy, as well as the award for music video for ""It Ain't My Fault."" Brothers Osborne faced stiff competition in the duo race, as superstar couple Tim McGraw and Faith Hill received their first nomination in the category.""Us going against Tim alone would be impossible, but you throw Faith Hill in the mix,"" John told Rolling Stone earlier, assessing their chances of victory. ""But we're appreciative of all of that and [winning has] changed our lives in a big way. I think it gave us a huge amount of validity to people who are not in the country industry. It opened people's eyes and it opened the door to a lot of things.""Elsewhere, Atkins was named Songwriter of the Year and Lauren Alaina, Brett Young and the trio Midland scored in the new artist categories.

51,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/acms-2015-nine-secrets-behind-the-texas-sized-show-60773/,"When the 50th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards airs Sunday night on CBS from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, there will be more than 7,000 workers behind the scenes trying to pull off a seamless show. Academy of Country Music CEO Bob Romeo gave Rolling Stone Country a private tour of the venue on Saturday, revealing secrets about the show, which relocated to the Lone Star State this year from its usual Las Vegas home for the golden anniversary.

Romeo&apos;s tips provide a sneak preview of what to expect on the broadcast, while also offering a glimpse into the action off camera and what it takes to put together an awards show at a stadium better known as the home of the Dallas Cowboys.
Face to Face: Instead of sitting in the audience, the artists will be seated in what&apos;s been dubbed ""the choir loft,"" a section built between the two stages. ""We took all the seats out of the stadium and we built this structure with 1,500 seats, which is the same amount of seats that we have on the whole floor of the MGM Grand Garden Arena [In Las Vegas] for the industry and the artists,"" Romeo says. ""The neat thing is they&apos;ll be facing the fans the whole time.""
Blake and Luke&apos;s Hideaway: Directly behind the stage is a pipe-and-draped makeshift dressing room for co-hosts Blake Shelton and Luke Bryan. ""It&apos;s a quick change room for Luke and Blake, so if we have an emergency or a problem we can pull one of them right onto stage if we have to kill some time,"" Romeo says. ""There&apos;s no drinking in there, Luke. No drinking, Blake,"" he jokes.
The Bat Phone: Also right behind the stage is an area that serves as the show&apos;s nerve center. ""If there&apos;s a problem, we have phones back to CBS Control,"" Romeo says. If there&apos;s an issue, the viewing audience will likely never know. ""A couple of years as we pushed Keith [Urban] on stage, we had no guitar [sound]. We couldn&apos;t find it, couldn&apos;t fix it. Ten seconds to air, [we] pick up the phone: ""Roll commercial."" So the network rolled a commercial and [then] another. We realized we didn&apos;t know what was wrong. We roll him off the stage, we roll the next act on the stage. In real time, we change the teleprompter so that at home, fans only saw 8 minutes of commercial and then we&apos;re back to the show.""
Raise &apos;Em Up: More than 35,000 audience members will be outfitted with computer-controlled wristbands. ""Before a number, we&apos;re going to say, for example, &apos;On Alan Jackson, everybody hold your hands in the air&apos;,"" Romeo says. ""We can then control [the bands] through a computer and spell out things, like &apos;Welcome&apos; or &apos;Hi Alan.&apos; We can change their color, make them blink."" Each wristband contains four Triple-A batteries and is individually addressable.
Me and My Gang: When the show is in Las Vegas, most of the artists stay at the host hotel, the MGM Grand. But instead of having the artists spread throughout the Dallas area, the ACMs created an artists&apos; bus compound directly behind AT&T Stadium for the acts and their crews. With space for 96 busses representing the 26 acts, the compound is like a summer camp for artists. ""We&apos;ve got a bar [dubbed Bluke&apos;s], a basketball court, foosball table, corn hole, a barbecue pit,"" Romeo says. ""We said, &apos;let&apos;s try to create a home&apos;."" Dierks Bentley stayed at the compound on Friday night, but at his wife&apos;s behest, shifted to a five-star hotel the next night.


Raise the Roof: AT&T Stadium&apos;s translucent roof created all kinds of lighting issues. The solution? The ACMs covered it with a tarp that costs a cool $1 million. ""We actually bought the material and it had to be flown in by helicopter and put on the roof. It took days for them to hook and string the fabric to the roof,"" Romeo says. ""The Cowboys and the ACM own the covering so we&apos;re hoping we can get our money back as we rent it [out]."" Total cost to put on the ACMs in AT&T Stadium? North of $15 million; more than four times what it costs to stage the show in Las Vegas.
U2 Helped the ACMs: After the ACMs decided to hold the 50th anniversary at AT&T Stadium, which opened in 2009, Romeo, the ACM board, and several sound experts flew to Dallas to take in a U2 show at the venue. Following that, a whole sound engineering staff rejiggered the sound system, adding in manifolds and baffles, and making other changes to ensure the sound is as strong as can be. ""When you hang speakers, [the sound] comes out and hits the ceiling. It bounces down and it sounds weird,"" Romeo says. ""We don&apos;t want the sound hitting the roof because when you hit the roof, that&apos;s what causes the problem.""
The Cowboy Way: The evening&apos;s host, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, has been to rehearsals every day. ""There&apos;s a guy who is actively involved,"" Romeo says. Jones will watch the show from his private suite on the 50-yard line. Joining him will be Texas Governor Greg Abbott and CBS CEO Les Moonves. Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo and Cowboys legend Troy Aikman will present on the show, but may end up in the suite as well.
Jail Break: Should anyone get too rowdy during the show, they risk getting thrown into the pokey. There are four jail cells in the bowels of AT&T Stadium. ""Usually if someone during a football game or event gets out of hand, fights [or] gets overly intoxicated, we have to bring them down here and we&apos;ll [keep] them down here until we can get a unit from City of Arlington police department,"" says Brett Arendt, AT&T Stadium security manager.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202474.26/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320230554-20190321012554-00008.warc.gz
52,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/adam-hood-downturn-video-753680/,"Adam Hood's last video for ""She Don't Love Me"" found the songwriter buried alive by a heartless ex. In his latest clip for the song ""Downturn,"" off his superb album Somewhere in Between, he's nowhere to be found.

Instead, Hood cedes the spotlight to a pair of actors, who play a small-town couple driving through their day. They stop for lunch, bop into a bar to dance and nearly get into a fight with a patron. It's a road trip fraught not with outsized drama, but with the mundane pitfalls of life.

""This song is an effort to think positive through all of life’s negatives. For me it came from a musician’s perspective. Jason Eady and I wrote it while we were sitting in a hotel room in El Paso, Texas. I’m sure it’s no surprise to most but life on the road is a challenge no matter what level you’re at,"" Hood says. ""I wanted the video itself to be relatable to everybody. The idea was to just showcase people making the best of their daily lives, which is something I think we all struggle to do. It’s also nice to be part of the narrative in a music video rather than having a part in the actual filming. It lets the song be more active than the person singing it.""

Joining the Country Music Hall of Fame members on select dates are Chris Janson, Tracy Lawrence, Restless Heart, Exile, Charlie Daniels Band, the Marshall Tucker Band and the Oak Ridge Boys.

Formed in 1969 in Fort Payne, Alabama, the group played the nearby (now defunct) Canyon Land amusement park on weekends, before making their way to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where they built up their fan base at a bar called the Bowery. Alabama — made up of Randy Owen, Teddy Gentry and Jeff Cook — would go on to dominate country music in the Seventies and Eighties, one of the few bands to do so at the time, while also crossing over into the pop charts. They remain one of the most awarded groups in history and their explosive, rock-fueled stage shows became a blueprint for future country superstars from Garth Brooks to Luke Bryan and beyond.

""We never thought playing for tips at the Bowery in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, that 50 years later we would still playing arenas, stadiums and festivals,"" says Owen in a statement. ""Teddy, Jeff and I are humbled at the amount of fans that are coming out to see us. We are finding out that we are playing to three generations of fans who have followed us and our music from day one. The fans are the ones responsible for our continued success on the road and we love them.""

55,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/alabamas-jeff-cook-diagnosed-with-parkinsons-disease-192437/,"As the most successful country group of the Eighties, Alabama dominated the charts and scored a number of pop crossover hits. But it was the band's electrifying live shows that elevated them to legendary status and ensured their induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Now the group faces the prospect of performing without long-serving fiddle and guitar player Jeff Cook, who has revealed he has Parkinson's disease, a progressive disorder of the nervous system that causes tremors, rigid muscles and imprecise movement. Cook, 67, says he was diagnosed with the disease about four years ago, and told his fellow Alabama members Randy Owen and Teddy Gentry immediately. He revealed he will step back from touring with the group effective April 29th, but made it clear he is not leaving the band. In a prepared statement for fans, which he read to the Tennessean on Tuesday, with Owen and Gentry seated beside him, he detailed the personal effect Parkinson's has had on him. ""This disease robs you of your coordination, your balance, and causes tremors,"" Cook wrote. ""For me, this has made it extremely frustrating to try and play guitar, fiddle or sing. I've tried not to burden anyone with the details of my condition because I do not want the music to stop or the party to end and that won't change no matter what. Let me say, I'm not calling it quits, but sometimes our bodies dictate what we have to do, and mine is telling me it's time to take a break and heal.""Other than a May 27th show in Orange Beach, Alabama, and a fan event in the group's Fort Payne, Alabama, hometown in June, Cook says he will only make appearances with the group depending on how he's feeling. Other musicians will fill in for him going forward, but his fellow members Randy Owen and Teddy Gentry insist Cook will always have a place on stage.  ""We could hire 10 people, but we can't replace Jeff Cook in the group Alabama,"" said Gentry, unable to hold back tears as he spoke. ""Like Jeff said, when this is all you've ever known and you love the music, you want to see it go on as long as possible. Alabama has surpassed what any of us ever dreamed of, but I still love to play more or as much as I did [yesterday], and I know Jeff does, too.""The cultural impact of Alabama, since their first chart-topping single, ""Tennessee River,"" in 1980, cannot be overstated. Forging a path that saw them blend traditional, fiddle-based country with hard-charging Southern rock, the group brought younger listeners to country radio and transformed the live-concert experience, paving the way for Kenny Chesney, Luke Bryan, Miranda Lambert and dozens of others who followed. Since their debut, Alabama have amassed 43 Number Ones, sold more than 75 million albums and earned three CMA Entertainer of the Year trophies, among dozens of other honors. After their first Farewell Tour, which was announced in 2002 and concluded in 2004, the members went on to various solo projects. In 2005, the group put their retirement on hold to play a benefit for victims of Hurricane Katrina, but Cook, who had recently undergone gastric bypass surgery, had to quit before the show ended. In 2010, Randy Owen faced a health scare of his own, having been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Since the group's initial retirement in 2004, Cook has released several solo LPs with his Allstar Goodtime Band, which includes the addition of a horn section. The band, minus drummer Mark Herndon, reunited in 2011 in Birmingham, Alabama, for a benefit concert following a devastating tornado in their home state. They resumed touring in 2013 and in 2015 released Southern Drawl, their first LP of new music in 14 years.In August 2016, Cook, who had just celebrated his birthday, was guest of honor at the 10th annual Jeff Cook Days in Guntersville, Alabama, where the theme was ""No Bad Days."" At the event, Cook solemnly told Huntsville's WHNT News, ""It's been a lot of fun. We might be here next year. Might not. We might not be here next year that's why there's no bad days.""With regard to the band's future as both a stage and recording act, the remaining members of Alabama have Cook's full blessing to continue in his absence. ""He wants us to go on,"" Owen told the Tennessean. ""We want the music to go on. I'm going to be very honest. I don't know if I have the fire. The only way I do, is knowing that Jeff is totally, 'Go get it.'""""Go get it,"" Cook replied, ""with witnesses."" He added later, ""If I'm healed overnight, I'll be at the next show. I do believe in prayer and I'm not giving up.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205163.72/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326115319-20190326141319-00013.warc.gz

In addition to Morgan and Houser, many of Jackson's shows will include a performance by aspiring artists who've played AJ's Good Time Bar, Jackson's Nashville honky-tonk.

A three-time CMA Entertainer of the Year, Jackson continued his award-winning ways in 2018 with induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in June. The prestigious institution features more than 400 tunesmiths from a wide array of musical genres among its ranks.

That same month, Jackson was at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum – then located on Nashville's Music Row – to donate the radio his father had won in a contest at the Pepsi-Cola plant in Jackson's hometown of Newnan, Georgia. The radio, along with the music his family heard on it, had inspired his previous single, ""Chasin' That Neon Rainbow,"" still a staple for the singer-songwriter and Grand Ole Opry member 25-plus years later.On Tuesday, in what could only be described as a full-circle moment, Jackson was named one of the three newest inductees into the Country Music Hall of Fame, along with late musician, songwriter and actor Jerry Reed and ""The Gambler"" songwriter Don Schlitz. Following the unveiling of the new Hall of Fame members, Jackson reflected on those early years as the flagship artist on the Arista Nashville label, and the legacy he has built with such iconic hits as ""Here in the Real World,"" ""Remember When,"" ""Don't Rock the Jukebox"" and ""Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning).""""At the time, I don't think I was thinking about that [legacy],"" Jackson told Rolling Stone Country of that first trip to the Hall of Fame in '91. ""I was just so happy for them to have that radio. That was a big moment for me, to have something in the Hall of Fame. At that time, I was just trying to have hits and make the next album. At that time in my career, I was just trying to make it through the next year and hoping my career would last three or four years.""Jackson, who is currently in the middle of his Honky Tonk Highway Tour, admits he was surprised to learn how specific the Hall of Fame's guidelines are when it comes to attaining membership, which now includes just 133 men, women and groups since the first inductees – Hank Williams, Fred Rose and Jimmie Rodgers – in 1961. ""It made me realize it's hard to get in here,"" he says with a laugh. ""Even though I've done a lot, I still don't feel quite worthy, but I feel like it's an honor to qualify for what it requires to be in here with these great people. I've always tried to make music the first priority – not being a star, not being in the spotlight, just trying to make music that I loved, that the fans like, and not compromise that to fit into something else.""The newest Country Music Hall of Fame members will be officially inducted during the Medallion Ceremony later this year.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201882.11/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319012213-20190319034213-00110.warc.gz

Joining the ""Don&apos;t Rock the Jukebox"" singer for select dates will be Grammy-winning vocalist Lee Ann Womack, who recently released a surprise recording of the Christmas hymn ""O Come, All Ye Faithful.""

Angels and Alcohol, his first album of new material since 2012&apos;s Thirty Miles West, will be released on July 17th. Jackson wrote the bulk of the album&apos;s tracks himself, turning to outside songwriters like Michael White (who penned Blake Shelton&apos;s second Number One hit, ""The Baby"") and Troy Jones (Billy Currington&apos;s ""People Are Crazy"" and ""Pretty Good at Drinking Beer"") for just three of the album&apos;s ten tracks. Keith Stegall, his longtime producer, reprised his role behind the soundboard. 
For a quarter century, Jackson has sung a lot about living, a little about love and a bit about Jesus, bouncing his way between country, bluegrass, gospel and all the rootsy points in between. Although no tracks from Angels and Alcohol have been released, the album — which arrives on the heels of the Christian-themed Precious Memories Volume II and the self-explanatory Bluegrass Album — is presumably a return to his country roots.
Those roots will be on full display during the remaining dates on Jackson&apos;s Keepin&apos; It Country Tour, whose openers include everyone from Brandy Clark to Jeff Foxworthy.

60,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/alejandro-escovedo-on-new-album-surviving-rock-roll-ugly-trump-109619/,"There&apos;s a song on Alejandro Escovedo&apos;s new LP, Burn Something Beautiful, called ""I Don&apos;t Want to Play Guitar Anymore,"" a scorching, doo-wop drip of a track that has the 65-year-old Texan&apos;s fingers paralyzed by the ephemeral nature of life. It&apos;s no wonder that Escovedo thinks about such things, though: he narrowly escaped a long battle with hepatitis-C and, more recently, barely survived a hurricane while on honeymoon in Mexico with his new wife Nancy that left him with debilitating post-traumatic stress disorder. It&apos;s that yin-yang mixture of joy and fear – a new love, but the taste of death forever on his tongue - that inspired Burn Something Beautiful, his first album in four years. (Stream it exclusively below.)  ""There is a period of time I felt that music was the reason why I had gotten sick,"" Escovedo tells Rolling Stone Country about his disease, arguably exacerbated by the indulgences of the rock star lifestyle. ""There is that whole &apos;why me?"" period. It&apos;s a real roller coaster of emotions. Why was I the one chosen to bear this horrible disease? That idea, &apos;I don&apos;t want to play guitar anymore,&apos; came from Peter. Because music is what we love to do, and when we feel most complete.""The Peter he speaks of is Peter Buck, of R.E.M., who was a key collaborator on Burn Something Beautiful, along with Scott McCaughey of the Minus 5. The three men co-produced and co-wrote the album together, decamping to Portland, Oregon, miles away from Austin, Texas – where Escovedo lived until recently and is so heavily associated with (he now resides in Dallas). Continuing the singer&apos;s penchant for a shadowy mixture of punk, roots and rock, the record is low on gloss and high on assertive guitars and restless percussion, mature in subject matter but never composition. Escovedo may be in his sixties, but he doesn&apos;t temper the distortion or feedback for aged ears. ""Some people have told me that we sound younger than actual young people making rock & roll,"" Escovedo says – with the subtle wink being that rock & roll itself has become somewhat of a decaying pursuit, at least in its purest form. Burn Something Beautiful evokes that often-dissonant spirit of Lou Reed (""Johnny Volume"") melded with Escovedo&apos;s knack for a fiery, infectious punk refrain (""Horizontal""): timeless rather than trendy. ""We played a gig at a hotel in Dallas recently, and someone said we sounded &apos;classic rock,&apos;"" he laughs. ""Ten years ago I would have taken that as an insult. Not today. When my first solo albums came out they were never in the rock section. They were either in Mexican, Salsa, world beat [sections]. It took a long time for people to understand what I was doing.""Though it doesn&apos;t dictate the entirety of his sound, Escovedo&apos;s Mexican heritage is still a vital part of his identity, and he dedicated Burn Something Beautiful to his parents, and to ""immigrants who have made this country so great."" It&apos;s choice language, of course, directly echoing the ""Make America Great Again"" campaign of Donald Trump, who&apos;s boasted of a deportation task force and building a big ol&apos; wall. Escovedo, who stopped playing his song ""Castanets"" for two years when it wound up on George W. Bush&apos;s playlist, doesn&apos;t mince words when it comes to the Republican nominee. ""To see so much divisiveness and racism, that&apos;s never a good thing,"" he says. ""For those of us who would rather see unity than division, it&apos;s a total blow. I don&apos;t think he&apos;s funny, I don&apos;t think he&apos;s clever. He&apos;s an ugly person.""Escovedo&apos;s brushes with mortality have had him thinking a lot about the legacy we all leave behind – as people, as parents, as a country in this most volatile of election seasons. There were times when the music didn&apos;t seem enough: as he sings in ""I Don&apos;t Want to Play Guitar Anymore,"" ""when there&apos;s no stories left to sing, say goodbye to everything."" Now he&apos;s come to understand that even when he can no longer sing or write, there is still something beautiful burned into history. ""Books, records, whatever it is we leave behind, those things will live on forever,"" he says. ""I have seven children, and this is what I am leaving for them. The stories.""  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912206016.98/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326200359-20190326222359-00185.warc.gz

And Cooper himself admits as much.""Glen was one of the most unique guys. You think of Glen, country; Alice Cooper, rock & roll; we couldn't have been closer,"" Cooper told Phoenix, Arizona, TV station Fox 10 in a new interview. (Watch the full interview below.)""He could go hang out with the Rat Pack, or he could hang out with Donnie and Marie [Osmond], or he could hang out with the Beatles, or anybody. He was in that middle. He was just that all-purpose, good-looking kid that could do anything. He was the golden boy,"" Cooper says. ""And yet him and I were like this when it came to our sense of humor, when it came to golf, when it came to music.""While best known as a country music star, the Arkansas native was an accomplished studio musician who even moonlighted as a member of the Beach Boys in the mid-Sixties. ""He was one of the premier guitar players in rock and country. A lot of people don't know the respect he had in the rock & roll world,"" Cooper says. ""Eddie Van Halen asked one time, he said, 'Could you get me a guitar lesson with Glen?' Most rockers would go, 'What?' That's the kind of guitar player he was. He was considered one of the five best guitar players out there.""In their later years, Cooper and Campbell were golfing buddies who played together once or twice a week after they'd both gotten sober, found God and moved to Phoenix. ""He did cocaine more than just about anybody out there during what we called the 'L.A. Blizzard,' when everybody was into cocaine. But he had a real problem with it, I mean a huge problem. He navigated through that, I navigated through that, we both came out the other end with great families,"" Cooper recalls. ""That's what we had in common, was that we were survivors of that world and we both moved to Phoenix to get away from that world. And we were still in the business.""In 2011, Campbell revealed that he'd been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and it was during their golf outings together that Cooper says he first noticed the signs of his friend's deterioration. ""Every once in a while, he'd tell me a joke on the first tee. And on about the fourth tee he'd tell me the same joke again,"" Cooper says. Cooper admits that, with six years having passed from the time of Campbell's diagnosis to the time of his death, he's had time to come to terms with the passing of his friend. Campbell, too, had his chance to say farewell, first with his Goodbye Tour and ultimately with Adiós, his final album, which was released two months ago.""I think it's a relief for Glen and the
family,"" says Cooper, referring to the slow and often painful process of
death, both for the patients and their loved ones, that typically occurs with
Alzheimer's disease. ""I'm sure if it were up to Glen, five years ago
would've been fine with him. [His wife] Kim was so faithful taking care of him.
His kids were so faithful taking care of him. They're in that period now of
grief that's unexplainable.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204300.90/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325194225-20190325220225-00390.warc.gz

64,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/always-on-my-mind-songwriter-wayne-carson-dead-at-72-46448/,"Acclaimed songwriter Wayne Carson, a Grammy-winning member of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame whose credits include the country-pop classic ""Always on My Mind"" and the Box Tops&apos; 1967 chart-topper ""The Letter,"" died Monday in Franklin, Tennessee. According to his wife, Wyndi Harp Head, Carson had been battling numerous health issues and was placed in hospice care about a month ago. He was 72.

Born Wayne Carson Head in Denver, he was often credited by the name Wayne Carson Thomspon as his parents, professional musicians Odie and Olivia Head, went by the stage names of Shorty and Sue Thompson. When the family moved to Springfield, Missouri, to work at KWTO Radio, the teenaged Carson was inspired by Merle Travis to learn guitar and to eventually begin writing songs. He moved to Nashville in 1962.
In 1966, a song that he penned, ""Somebody Like Me,"" was played for Eddy Arnold by RCA producer and label head Chet Atkins. Arnold liked the song but thought it was too short. He personally contacted Carson and asked him to pen an additional verse. The song would eventually reach Number One, becoming Carson&apos;s first chart-topper. A string of successes quickly followed, including ""The Letter,"" which in addition to the Box Tops&apos; iconic version had been cut by a slew of other artists, including a memorable version by Joe Cocker. The song is among Rolling Stone&apos;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 1968, Carson&apos;s composition ""Who&apos;s Julie"" gave Mel Tillis his first Top Ten hit.
But it&apos;s ""Always on My Mind,"" a song Carson reportedly wrote at his kitchen table in about 10 minutes, which would eventually earn him Grammy, CMA and ACM awards. After holding onto the song for a year, Carson turned it over to co-writers Johnny Christopher and Mark James and producer Chips Moman, who added a bridge to the composition. First recorded by R&B singer Gwen McCrae and a minor country hit for Brenda Lee, it was Elvis Presley&apos;s emotional version, recorded as he was divorcing wife Priscilla, which reached the Top Twenty on both the pop and country charts. In 1982, three years after the song reached the Top Twenty again (by John Wesley Ryles), Willie Nelson scored both a Number One country hit and a Top Five pop single with his version. The Number One country song of the year would go on to be crowned CMA Single of the Year in 1982, CMA Song of the Year (in 1982 and 1983) and ACM Single of the Year, along with netting three Grammys. In 1987, ""Always on My Mind"" returned to the charts yet again, this time in an upbeat version by U.K. duo Pet Shop Boys. The song topped the U.K. chart and was a Top Five hit in the U.S.
Carson&apos;s wonderfully titled ""She&apos;s Actin&apos; Single (I&apos;m Drinkin&apos; Doubles)"" became a Top Ten hit in 1975 for Gary Stewart and was later cut by Wade Hayes. Other artists who would cover his songs include Conway Twitty, Johnny Paycheck, B.J. Thomas, Ray Price, Waylon Jennings, Shelby Lynne, the Beach Boys and Tina Turner. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1997.

65,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/amanda-shires-jason-isbell-walking-the-floor-podcast-745670/,"When Amanda Shires first appeared on Walking the Floor, she was a new mother, splitting her time between solo gigs, an ongoing tour with Jason Isbell and her responsibilities as a parent. She returns to the show for a second interview this week. Much has changed during the two years that separate My Own Piece of Land from To the Sunset, with Shires — now a Grammy-winning musician, as well as a graduate of the masters poetry program at Sewanee — flexing hew newly-sharpened writing chops on the latter release.

From a midair songwriting powwow with John Prine to her childhood fiddle lessons from Texas Playboy Frankie McWhorter, Shires takes podcast host Chris Shiflett through the Americana milestones that have led to this year's To the Sunset. Here are five things we learned from Shires' interview.

John Prine gives great touring advice.
""Always travel with your own condiments,"" says Shires, rattling off some touring advice dispensed by longtime road warrior (and frequent tourmate) John Prine. ""Be yourself onstage. Be yourself offstage. Be yourself when you write songs.""

John Prine also writes great songs. . .even in mid-air.
While flying to a show with Prine, Shires found herself engaged in an impromptu songwriting session with the country legend. ""I was working on my thesis, because it was coming up on 'defending thesis time,'"" remembers Shires, who'd lugged a pile of schoolbooks onto the flight. Deep into the writing process of The Tree of Forgiveness, Prine asked Shires if she'd brought along a rhyming dictionary. She hadn't, but the two nevertheless began talking about the rhyming process, which spiraled into a cowriting session at 45,000 feet.

When it came time to write To the Sunset, Shires headed to the closet.
Being a parent to a three-year-old daughter is wonderful … but it doesn't always provide an artist with free time to create. ""With Mercy around, it's super awesome, but any time I try to sit down and play an instrument, suddenly it's a family jam, and she's playing the tuba,"" Shires explains. ""So that happens, and then out comes the crayons, and everything else that happens. I wasn't getting anything done. I told Jason I was gonna have to move into the closet. And he said 'Cool.'"" Sandwiching herself into the couple's wardrobe, Shires found a space where she could create, try out new ideas and even tape songwriting ideas onto the walls. To the Sunset owes much of its existence to that clothes-filled room.

Although not expressly political, To the Sunset was inspired by today's social climate, including the modern female empowerment movement.
Shires credits current events with inspiring several tracks on her new album. ""'Take on the Dark' — that's definitely a product of dark times,"" she says. ""'Eve's Daughter' — that's like, 'Make way, women are cool.' I feel like it's my responsibility to try and do at least a little bit for my own daughter ... It's just really cool that there are a lot of people speakers right now. Not just musicians. That's one benefit we have to this shit-ass presidency.""

She's the brains behind some of Jason Isbell's best gear.
""I buy him guitars, she says, rattling off a list of instruments, pedals and amps — including a Tone King, a Klon Centaur and a Vibrolux — that she's added to his rig over the years. She then makes a FaceTime call to Isbell, who takes a break from his daily workout and talks to them about his approach to Sunset's guitar work.

66,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/amanda-shires-talks-personal-new-album-writing-with-jason-isbell-110650/,"Amanda Shires remembers riding shotgun in Billy Joe Shaver&apos;s car, heading toward another show in 2007. She&apos;d been touring the Texas circuit for years, landing her first major gig at 15 years old – as a fiddler for Western swing big-wigs the Texas Playboys, no less – and joining Shaver&apos;s band in her early twenties. For an aspiring solo artist who wanted to front her own group, those jobs felt like the ultimate internship: a chance to play big rooms and learn lessons from the real legends of the Lone Star State. Shires worried that she&apos;d painted herself into a corner, though. If fans were used to seeing her as a fiddler-for-hire, would they accept her a songwriter?""Billy Joe and I were driving to some show one day,"" she says, ""and he had two radar detectors in the car, one stacked right on top of the other, because he&apos;s a crazy, wild man. I&apos;d just done this fiddle record – it was all instrumentals, except for two songs where I sang – and he said, &apos;Let&apos;s hear that fiddle CD of yours.&apos; So I played it, and after hearing one of the songs I wrote, he said, &apos;You should keep writing songs. You&apos;re a great songwriter, and if you keep doing it, you&apos;ll be a really great songwriter.&apos; At first, I thought he might be trying to fire me.""Shaver wasn&apos;t trying to fire her. Even so, Shires backed out of the gig not long after that car ride, pulling up stakes in Texas and relocating to Nashville by the decade&apos;s end. There, she launched the solo career that had proved so difficult to kickstart back home. Paying the bills as a part-time waitress and taking occasional sideman gigs with artists like Justin Townes Earle, she doubled down on songwriting, earning new fans – including fellow songwriter Jason Isbell, whom she married in 2013 – with the solo albums Carrying Lightning and Down Fell the Doves. Her latest, My Own Piece of Land, finds Shires taking stock of the lives, loves and landscapes around her. She wrote most of the music last year, during the final weeks of a pregnancy that kept her at home while Isbell wrapped up his own tour.""When I got home,"" she remembers, ""I was 33 weeks pregnant. I had done everything from organizing my garage to organizing the closets. All that nesting stuff. I was sitting here with nothing to do, so I started writing songs. It kept my anxiety level way down. It gave me something to do – something to express – so I could do something other than sit down and stare at my belly some more, or sleep on my side all night long."" On ""When You&apos;re Gone,"" Shires puts a name to the empty feeling left behind by an absent lover. ""I wouldn&apos;t call it silence; it&apos;s a different kind of quiet,"" she clarifies, while Isbell chimes in on electric guitar. ""Nursery Rhyme"" finds her prepping for the arrival of daughter Mercy Isbell, who was born two weeks after the recoding sessions wrapped. And ""Mineral Wells"" – an older song about Shires&apos; own childhood, written years ago – features an in utero cameo from the youngest Isbell, who can be faintly heard kicking her mom&apos;s stomach during the song&apos;s ukulele track.With Isbell co-writing two songs and playing guitar throughout the record, My Own Piece of Land is a family affair. That&apos;s not exactly a new thing – Shires has been touring with Isbell&apos;s 400 Unit since 2013, appearing on albums like Southeastern and Something More Than Free along the way – but this time, the matriarch is in charge. Isbell&apos;s recent success may cast a long shadow, but if anyone views Shires as the First Lady of Americana, songs like ""When You&apos;re Gone"" and ""My Love (The Storm)"" proves she&apos;s worthy of holding her own office.""We don&apos;t co-write often,"" Shires admits. ""We generally go into separate rooms and write, then show each other our work and share our thoughts. But it&apos;s nice to have somebody that you can trust to look at your work. We treat co-writing like a thing we don&apos;t need to pressure each other to do. We let it happen if it&apos;s going to.""Produced by family friend Dave Cobb, My Own Piece of Land doesn&apos;t focus on Shires&apos; fiddle playing as much as her vocals, which occupy the brightest patch of spotlight here. She sings her new songs with a twittering lilt that she describes as ""goat-like,"" adding, ""I went to a vocal coach to try and smooth out that quiver, but it can&apos;t be cured."" She now embraces that peculiarity. It&apos;s part of her story. It&apos;s part of her land. And these days, Shires is happy with what she&apos;s got. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202476.48/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321010720-20190321032720-00302.warc.gz
67,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/american-aquariums-bj-barham-on-why-jason-isbell-is-a-hero-new-album-things-change-629049/,"In a business where media training is all but an essential part of the artist development process, BJ Barham remains a refreshingly candid interview. While previewing his band American Aquarium's new album Things Change this week, the North Carolina singer-songwriter also weighed in on his relationship with Jason Isbell, navigating his thirties, and the real reason why his old band up and walked away. With its theme of paternal advice, your song ""Madeline"" is similar to Jason Isbell's ""Outfit."" He produced American Aquarium's 2012 album Burn. Flicker. Die. – is he an artist you've sought to emulate in your career or are any similarities mostly coincidental?Barham: After I released [""Madeline""], a lot of people made that correlation. He's kind of on a different level these days – he's about as big a superstar in this genre as I think there's gonna be without breaking over like [Chris] Stapleton did. He's at the height of independent Americana —""I say what the fuck I want, I write what the fuck I want."" It'd be stupid for me to say I don't look up to that. He's been a friend for about a decade. Who wouldn't want to overcome your demons, get married, have a kid, and win a couple Grammys along the way? Anybody who's doing this and isn't looking up to Jason Isbell is doing it wrong.How did he come to produce Burn. Flicker. Die.?Barham: We met back when we were both drinking. We opened up for him in Raleigh. He asked where he should go after the show. He's an avid pool player. We went to my local shitty dive bar, Slim's. We had a lot in common. We're both college-educated Southerners who tend to lean left on social issues. We bonded on a lot of stuff. When it came time to make what we thought would be our final record in 2012, Burn Flicker Die, he said, “You come to Muscle Shoals, I'll do it.” We spent a week in Muscle Shoals right before Southeastern was recorded. It was before his sobriety. We were drinking heavy in the studio. It was right when he started dating Amanda [Shires] and she came down and played fiddle. It was kind of nice to watch Jason transform – a good songwriter who got in his own way all the time. It's like me: I was a mess onstage, even though a lot of people saw promise in my writing. So it was nice to watch what happens when you get out of your own way.John Fullbright produced Things Change. What do you think it is that makes these all-star songwriters want to produce your records, and how do Fullbright and Isbell's processes in the studio differ?Barham: I'm finally at a point in my career and my life where I'm realizing that I've surrounded myself with some of the most legendary songwriters. It lets me know my path is not on the wrong track. [Fullbright is] very similar to working with Jason, to be completely honest. They're very hands-off; they let you make the record you want to make. If they hear something that doesn't sound as good, they'll make the critique. If you're doing something that serves the song, they're not going to try to change that. Songwriters have the song's best interest in mind at all times.You and your wife recently had a daughter. How'd you not end up naming her Madeline?Barham: For a long time, that was on the short list of what our first kid's name would be. And when we actually had the kid, my wife said, ""Since you've already written a song, we're not going to do that. It'd be really awkward to explain that Daddy wrote a song about you three years before you were born.""On the subject of names: how'd you land on the name American Aquarium?Barham: It's a Wilco lyric from ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart"" off Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. That record changed everything for me; it showed me you could pay homage to roots music and still be weird as fuck.You've got a whole new lineup of players on Things Change. How'd you go about recruiting your new bandmates, and how come the old ones left?Barham: The easiest thing to say is, ""Life happens."" A lot of those guys were with me for eight or nine years. When we started, we were on the same page – we wanted to do this for a living and were focused on doing it. But fast-forward nine years and people change. Once a couple guys decided to leave, everyone else saw it as their only way out. Looking back, it had to be me. We were at the height of our success, making a living making music. I'd love to blame something else, but I think they got tired of being in a band with me. One of the guys moved to Texas and runs a gym. Another went back to school for computer coding. It ran its course. Their heart wasn't in it anymore. The highlight of their day wasn't getting up onstage and playing music for people, and that's a problem. It was a big blow to me and I pouted about it for a couple weeks. Then my wife sat me down and said, ""You can either bitch about it or change it."" So I changed it; I found a band that wanted to tour every night, and everyone who's seen us live says it's the best version of American Aquarium yet. It's the same thing I was looking for in 2006 when we started playing together.There's a lyric in the Things Change track ""Tough Folks"" that is really powerful: ""Last November I saw firsthand what desperation makes good people do."" Has Trump's presidency managed to do much to change the lives of the folks in small towns who backed him?Barham: I don't think so. You can't go into West Virginia and promise to bring back an industry that died 20 years ago. But he said what they wanted to hear. If your specialized trade evaporated 20 years ago, and some snake-oil salesman says he can bring back the life you had, what do you have to lose? Another year in poverty seeing your entire community get torn apart by drug addiction?What do you have to say to people who would prefer that you ""shut up and sing?""Barham: You can't ask me to be raw and honest when it comes to my relationships, my demons, the road and my shortcomings, but turn off that honesty when it comes to how I see the world today. As a songwriter, my job is to observe, process and write – completely unfiltered. It’s not something that I can just turn off when it gets uncomfortable. I’d be doing me and the listener a disservice. The only reason people have problems with an artist being political is when the artist is outspoken about views that don’t fully align with theirs. I guarantee some of my friends and fans on the right would have fully agreed with these songs the morning after the 2008 election. Even if they can’t get behind my message, hopefully they can get behind one of their favorite artists being open and honest about the things that matter the most to him. If they can't, were they ever really a fan in the first place?On Wolves, you sang about being on the losing side of 25, although you made it pretty clear that you were quite content being on that side of the fence. Now that you've cleared 30, do you feel like you're on the winning side of the ledger?Barham: I'm surviving in an industry that has a 90 percent failure rate, and I get to tour and play in front of people every night. I get to come home to a wife and a kid and a house and a backyard. I don't have to dig ditches for a living, so I consider that a success. You're successful when you can travel to any town of the country and people pay to hear about what you think of things.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202188.9/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320004046-20190320030046-00431.warc.gz
68,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/american-idol-mentor-scott-borchetta-hails-shows-heavy-metal-success-55445/,"Scott Borchetta&apos;s no stranger to handpicking hitmakers — Taylor Swift, case in point — so when it came to selecting which singing competition to adorn with his million-dollar touch, it was a pretty easy choice: go with the one that gives birth to stars. The president and CEO of Big Machine Label Group will join American Idol as the contestants&apos; mentor for Season 14, which debuted last week on Fox, and he&apos;s pretty certain he&apos;s going to help judge triad Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban and Harry Connick, Jr. find the next Carrie Underwood.

""American Idol is the only show with so many platinum artists and careers,"" Borchetta told Rolling Stone Country before the American Country Countdown Awards, where he wore a solid black suit with ""Music Has Value"" handwritten on it in big block letters. ""And that&apos;s not disrespecting other shows, that&apos;s just a fact.""
Borchetta&apos;s not wrong. Despite sinking ratings, American Idol is still the only current televised musical competition to actually spur major stars: even though the last two winners (rocker Caleb Johnson and R&B belter Candice Glover) failed to resonate after they dusted off the finale&apos;s confetti, Underwood, Scotty McCreery, Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Hudson, Jordin Sparks and Chris Daughtry are all proof that the show&apos;s formula does work. The Voice has seen momentum from Cassadee Pope and Danielle Bradbury (who are both, coincidentally, signed to Borchetta&apos;s label), but Javier Colon? Tessanne Chin? Crickets. Those red chairs may turn viewers, but they don&apos;t forecast platinum albums.
With the addition of Urban in Season 12 and now Borchetta, one of Nashville&apos;s best eyes for chart-climbing talent, maybe it&apos;s proof that American Idol is betting on one thing for sure: country wins. It&apos;s certainly been true for The Voice, as its twangy champions have been the only ones to score any significant traction, and is undoubtedly the case for Idol. Underwood, McCreery and Kellie Pickler have all released gold or platinum records, and Clarkson&apos;s Jason Aldean collaboration, ""Don&apos;t You Wanna Stay,"" was nominated for a Grammy.
Borchetta, who won&apos;t be seen on Idol until February, is eager to help develop the show&apos;s next Grammy-worthy act. ""I just want to get in there because it&apos;s what do I every day,"" he says. ""And the ability for us to work with them now until the show is over instead of, &apos;OK, here&apos;s the winner, now do your best,&apos; is really a chance to get behind the scenes and help identify [talent] and make sure they are ready for what the rest of their life could look like.""
Since the departure of the V-necked wonder, Simon Cowell, American Idol&apos;s best (and most critical) moments were always when Jimmy Iovine, co-founder of Interscope Records, gave his opinion on the performances. What made Cowell work, beyond his entertainingly acid tongue, was that his views were actually from a label executive — when he said Underwood might be the most successful Idol star if she took the crown, the audience actually believed him. The same words from the man responsible for Swift and rising acts like Maddie & Tae could do wonders to motivate voters and, most importantly, viewers. ""You need some element of people that actually sign artists in there,"" Borchetta agrees.
Will he ever make the jump from mentor to judge? ""I don&apos;t know,"" he says. ""Let&apos;s take it one season at a time. I don&apos;t want to be in a situation where I can&apos;t be truthful. Next question?""
More proof that the Idol execs are hoping for a country star: the winner will not only receive guidance from Borchetta, but also a deal with Big Machine, in partnership with 19 Entertainment and Universal Music Group.
Whatever the genre, time will tell if Borchetta ultimately lets the winning artist stream their music on services like Spotify, from which Swift notoriously plucked her albums with steadfast support from her label head. ""All music shouldn&apos;t be free,"" he says. ""We have to keep screaming that message. It&apos;s not going to be easy, but this is a fixable problem."" Screaming, and writing it on his suits.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202471.4/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320210433-20190320232433-00390.warc.gz
69,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/american-recordings-187277/,"Among country&apos;s old guard, Johnny Cash remains incontrovertibly cool. Arbiters of hip from &apos;60s Dylan to &apos;90s U2 have grooved to the renegade soul of this Arkansas sharecropper&apos;s son, this original rockabilly. Aptly, Rick Rubin provides American Recordings a production that&apos;s tougher than leather: stark guitar and Cash&apos;s wise-as-Isaiah vocal delivery. Songs by writers as diverse as Leonard Cohen, Glenn Danzig, Nick Lowe and Tom Waits make this Cash&apos;s boldest collection, but it&apos;s Cash&apos;s own work (""Delia&apos;s Gone,"" ""Redemption"") and the tense yin and yang of his restless heart and Christian soul that provoke country as cathartic as country gets.
Another snowcapped mountain, Willie Nelson plays it safe on Healing Hands. Grouping his classics (""Crazy,"" ""Night Life"") with standards of the sort that propelled Stardust (""I&apos;ll Be Seeing You,"" ""All the Things You Are""), his 1978 crossover breakout, country&apos;s mildly disreputable granddad battles a clot of strings but slices through. The character of his singing, after all — as rivetingly mannerist as any jazz vocalist&apos;s — cannot be denied.
Duets have been the fail-safe airplay guarantor of recent years, so Tammy Wynette&apos;s series of star turns with Sting, Lyle Lovett, Smokey Robinson, Wynonna and Joe Diffie is no conceptual earth shaker.

Mostly, though, they were all there to have fun.

An unofficial kickoff to the week's festivities, the Tuesday night party has become an annual tradition for the Music City festival, but this year's event — with Whiskey Wolves of the West, Chuck Mead and the Grassy Knoll Boys, and Andrew Leahey and the Homestead splitting house-band duties — put musical activism front and center. Even the name of the party, Better Together: Show Up and Sing!, was a play on those who want artists to ""shut up and sing.""

""Isn't it fucked up how these political songs are so relevant now? What the fuck,"" said Mother Station singer and longtime Afghan Whigs collaborator Susan Marshall, as she prepared to sing Buffalo Springfield's ""For What It's Worth"" with Leahey during the opening portion of the show, presented by Guitar Town, Sin City, and 14 Inch Fringe.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axk25uwiqqs

Marshall, in town from nearby Memphis, was onstage as much as anyone not playing in a backing band last night. She popped back up to sing a bristling version of Stevie Wonder's ""Living for the City"" with Will Hoge, took the lead on a group rave-up of Aretha Franklin's ""Chain of Fools"" during Whiskey Wolves' closing set, and joined together for the all-star sing-along finale of Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come.""

But she was hardly the only one doing the rounds, with a guest list that included 30 additional artists for a marathon jam session and love-in that stretched more than four hours. Carlene Carter dropped in to sing Loretta Lynn's ""The Pill,"" Jaime Wyatt and Sam Morrow teamed up on Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Run Through the Jungle,"" and Drivin N Cryin's Kevn Kinney ripped through an extra scuzzy version of the Clash's ""Clampdown"" with Audley Freed and Tim Nielsen.

Several artists came back for second or even third turns at the mic, like Hoge, who tackled Warren Zevon's ""Laywers, Guns, and Money"" later in the evening. Brian Wright of Cafe Rooster Records played guitar on the Who's ""The Kids Are Alright"" during Mead's set and then came back to sing lead on Bob Dylan's ""Like a Rolling Stone"" with Whiskey Wolves. No one, however, played with extremes as much as Allen Thompson, who first did a dead-on Michael Stipe on R.E.M.'s ""Orange Crush"" and then came back for a convincing Bob Marley reggae on ""Get Up Stand Up,"" assisted that time around by the Watson Twins.



Sticking to the script of what does or doesn't constitute Americana music wasn't really the order of the night, as this show was largely an excuse for friends to get together, a fact reflected by how often musicians introduced one another by recalling how they first met or the influence one had had on the other. Much of the material skewed toward canonized protest material of the Baby Boomer generation, which could have easily devolved into a self-important kumbaya had it not been approached with a cheeky sense of humor.

Credit for a lot of that goes to the house bands, who kept things more camp than campfire singalong. Leahey and the Homestead brought a distinct Eighties vibe to their set, both with the anthemic heartland rock the group is known for (Leahey's back-to-back, head-on-your-shoulder moment with Jon Latham during Bruce Springsteen's ""The Rising"" was peak BFF level) and a far more unexpected cover of Tears for Fears' ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World."" Leroy Powell and Tim Jones of Whiskey Wolves came out during Mead's set, reveling in the good ol' boy humor of Merle Haggard's ""Okie From Muskogee.""

The sillier things got, the better, and Mead and his band threw curveballs like no other. Particularly hilarious was his bassist, Mark Andrew Miller, diving into the sharp political commentary on Schoolhouse Rocks! classic ""I'm Just a Bill,"" complete with some ad libbed (and very not-kid-friendly) F-bombs while Mead played a perfect straight man. That may be the funniest thing that happens all week during AmericanaFest, but it already won't be the most surreal; that honor goes to Aaron Lee Tasjan, who took the stage shortly thereafter in a sequined women's jacket to sing Helen Reddy's ""I Am Woman"" — and damn well pulled it off.

75,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/amy-helm-on-finding-her-own-voice-with-didnt-it-rain-album-55150/,"Her dad was Levon Helm, the renowned drummer for the Band. Mom is singer-songwriter Libby Titus, and her stepfather is Steely Dan&apos;s Donald Fagen. Still, when it comes to making music, Amy Helm is very much her own person.
""All of my parents, stepparents, their friends and peers [were] really good in backing off and letting me find my way,"" Helm tells Rolling Stone Country of making her rootsy new album, Didn&apos;t It Rain. ""And then when I was giving in to fear too much, they were really good about stepping in. My dad would always say to me, &apos;Buck up, girl!&apos;""

Though the set marks her solo debut, Helm is hardly a newcomer. She recorded three albums with alt-country quartet Ollabelle and spent 10 years in the Midnight Ramble Band with her father. Levon played on three tracks on Amy&apos;s record, his last recordings before he passed away in 2012. He&apos;s not the only recognizable name on the album: Allison Moorer sings back up, while John Medeski and Little Feat&apos;s Bill Payne both play keyboards.
It&apos;s clearly heard on the project that Helm shares a certain loose-limbed sensibility with Bonnie Raitt, her rangy voice easily sliding from the New Orleans&apos; tinged title track (one of several covers on the album) to the swampy closer, ""Wild Girl."" Rolling Stone Country caught up with the versatile singer-songwriter in Colorado, where she was on a working vacation with her two young sons.
Following your success with Ollabelle and the Ramble, why was the time right to do a solo record?I wanted to challenge myself to step farther out and see what it would feel like to have to lead a song and lead a whole set and to do what all my heroes that made me want to sing in the first place were doing.
Over the course of making the album, you were going through a lot of life changes, including your father&apos;s death. How did that affect the album?I was facing the end of my marriage and delivered my second baby boy and everything just shifted all at once. When that happens, it really throws you into a place where you have to reach deep down and let yourself get very vulnerable and find your strength in a way that you hadn&apos;t had to before. [The changes] re-formed how I sang the songs and what I was writing and what material I was choosing.
And you re-recorded half the album.When I started making that album I had actually never done a gig of my own. After my father passed, I started to do small gigs under my own name. As we built the band and got more confident, what we were doing live just didn&apos;t match what I had recorded so I felt it was really important for me to go in and try to re-cut some of the songs that had changed and grown so much just from being road tested.
Your dad is listed as Executive Producer. What role did he play exactly?Financially, he was giving me studio time at no cost, [and] he was giving me a little extra money here and there to pay the musicians. He had wanted to see me do this probably 10 years before I did. I think he was really excited to watch me take what I had learned and the musical musculature I had developed with Ollabelle and the Ramble Band and try it in new waters. He had that vision for me before I had it for myself.
Beyond the songs he plays on, how much of the album did he get to hear?He got hear a lot of it, which makes me really happy.
What is your favorite memory of performing with your dad?When my dad&apos;s voice started to come back after he had treatments for throat cancer. He had lost his voice completely. There was a period of time when he would try [to sing] a little bit with just the two of us in the living room, with the mandolin and guitar, singing hymns that he had grown up on, singing a Muddy Waters song he wanted to show me, singing ""In the Pines,"" together. He could just barely whisper and I could tell exactly what he was trying to do, and I found him with my voice and we just whisper-sang. I felt honored to be able to share that with him in the musical way and start healing that part of his voice.
What have you learned about performing from touring with Patty Griffin and Mavis Staples this summer?Both of them stand inside themselves and their artistry so clearly and so strongly. They know what they want to tell, and I really admire that. Of course, with Mavis being part of the civil rights movement, watching her sing some of those songs and give that out to people with such joy and such commitment — she knows that these songs have to be learned by the next generation. It&apos;s very powerful. I finish my set and I get out into the house and find an empty seat, and I&apos;m just transfixed every night.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202671.79/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322135230-20190322161230-00554.warc.gz

The Alabama native is joined by a hearty array of musicians for ""All on My Mind,"" including horns, backup singers, and even a four-piece string section. East, sweaty and disheveled, dips, dives, and weaves his way around the stage, clutching the mic stand with both hands as he digs deep into his vocal range for the song's convention-breaking romantic proclamations.

No less steamy, if a little less theatrical, is ""King for a Day,"" which sees East ditch the strings but pick up his own acoustic guitar for a performance that's more of a smolder than a quick burn.

East shares the bill for this week's broadcast with Grammy-winning pop star Sam Smith, marking the first split episode of Austin City Limits' latest season, the 44th for the long-running PBS staple. Making his first appearance on the ACL stage, East's set — recorded in June — draws almost entirely on material from his latest LP, Encore, which was produced by Dave Cobb and released in January. Smith, meanwhile, recently recorded a duet with Brandi Carlile, ""Party of One.""

77,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/anderson-east-on-the-redemption-of-performing-live-new-album-encore-204023/,"Anderson East emerges from side stage just in time to grab the microphone and give it a windmill twirl before singing the opening lines of ""Sorry You're Sick,"" the energetic, Ted Hawkins-penned clap-along from his new album, Encore.With his hard-charging band laying down the driving beat and joyous horns blowing the melody, he reaches into the audience like a preacher leading his congregation. The capacity crowd at the intimate Duling Hall in Jackson, Mississippi, heeds the altar call with hands up, heads bobbing and voices shouting. It's a Tuesday night, but for East, it may as well be Sunday morning.""That's my church,"" he tells Rolling Stone Country before the show. ""I'm trying to get something really big out of it – getting musically to a place to where I feel justified, like I'm actually at the right place in the universe. I need that in my life."" Since dropping Encore (Low Country Sound/Elektra) in January, East and his six-piece band have brought the gospel to audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. Recorded with Dave Cobb in short bursts between live dates, Encore is a record made for – and practically on – the road. Playing upwards of 300 dates a year inspired East's crusade to inject Encore with the passion of his live performances.""Whenever it's great inside the venue, it's a different experience. It's like drug-addict-junkie level – you just want to do it more and more. I wanted to capture that emotion on a record,"" says East, whose passionate respect for the live stage even prompted him to call out Garth Brooks for lip-syncing at last November's CMA Awards.On Encore, East's influences meld seamlessly, stacking the album with Stax-worthy R&B grooves, gospel-blues ooohs and aaahs, surging keys and blasting brass. The bombastic swagger of first single ""All on My Mind,"" penned with Ed Sheeran, and the stomping chart-climber ""Girlfriend,"" combine East's love of tweed-toned Southern soul with cleverly offbeat vocal lines and arrangements.""King for a Day,"" written with Chris and Morgane Stapleton, is a lilting lovers' song, while Willie Nelson's ""Somebody Pick Up My Pieces"" is delivered as classic soul with a Joe Cocker-worthy vocal performance. ""Cabinet Door,"" a sparse, guitar-and-keys affair, finds East channeling Ryan Adams, who shows up to play guitar on ""This Too Shall Last.""Dave Cobb, who brought East to his Low Country Sound label after hearing him at Nashville's Bluebird Café, says the point of Encore was to push every song and performance, using Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen and Van Morrison as touchstones.""We weren't limiting ourselves to a three-minute pop song,"" says Cobb, who also produced East's 2015 breakthrough Delilah. ""It was about whatever is the most impactful, heartfelt thing we could possibly do, and we followed that lead.""Before the show East stands at center stage, barely recognizable in a black hoodie and tortoise-shell Warby Parker frames, his flop-top curls shoved under a crimson 'Bama cap. The bespectacled bandleader listens intently to each player as they run through ""Girlfriend"" a second time, head bowed in concentration, pausing only to deliver his nimble vocals.""I never really had the goal of being the artist,"" he says later. ""My day job was a recording engineer, and I really loved writing songs. So I was like, hell, if I can get a publishing deal, that would be amazing.""East soaked up the music around him growing up in Athens, Alabama, from country, gospel and Americana to jam bands like the Grateful Dead and Phish, from whom he learned to love improvisation. He lived just upriver from the Muscle Shoals scene, but its influence didn't take hold right way – even though he played a gig at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio as a teenager for an audience that included the famed Swampers.  Working at a local record store in Athens led him to discover the soulful side of Americana, and soon he was sinking his wages right into his record collection.""I was getting Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke, [thinking], 'Who are these people?' I had no clue,"" he says. ""That was the music that really grabbed me and made me feel good. I just wanted to learn how that sound was [made].""East tuned his ear for production while studying music engineering at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, where he met friend and frequent collaborator Aaron Raitiere. After moving to Nashville, he worked in studios to pay the bills but itched to write songs. ""Being in Nashville for 10 years before having the opportunity to tour around and play music, you're just sitting around with a bunch of other songwriters all day,"" he says. East grew comfortable with the casual, collaborative scene where he could work with Stapleton, Raitiere, his girlfriend Miranda Lambert and other songwriters over pizza and beer.""I've got buddies who pretty much write by themselves, like Jason Isbell. That's just not my process, because I tend to get really dark. I did that for so long, thinking a true artist has to find this knotted-up version of themselves and untangle it within a song. I would much rather have fun doing this thing that I love in every aspect.""The lights dim and East leads the band through a set heavy on Encore cuts, strumming an acoustic guitar behind them on ""Somebody Pick Up My Pieces"" and leading the crowd in a sing-along on ""All on My Mind."" He trades solos with guitarist Scotty Murray on ""This Too Shall Last,"" ending with a jammy run of dual-guitar harmonies. But he saves his finest moment – ""House Is a Building,"" the album's centerpiece – for the end.""I wanted to be able to make a record that [was] grandiose and also incredibly intimate,"" he says. ""I think ['House Is a Building'] does all of it as one piece of music. That was when I knew I had the period at the end of the sentence.""East and his band build the song's tension, his vocals gliding effortlessly from hushed and husky to strained and soaring on waves of blue-eyed soul. As the music crashes into its finale, East again gets up-close with the crowd, riding the song's coda – an encore within a song, as Cobb puts it – before exiting offstage the same way he entered. ""I find more and more reasons of what that song means, and I think the lyric sums it up,"" he says. ""I mean, we're sitting on a bus in a parking lot and it's like, 'I'm home.' Because I genuinely feel at home onstage.""For the grandson of a preacher, raised in church singing in youth choir, performing these songs live holds the key to something bigger, more personal. It's where the disarmingly casual artist can appease the inner perfectionist talking back to him. ""When you spend a lot of energy and time making a record – especially ones [where] we don't auto-tune things, we leave the ugly bits ­– [the stage] is the only place you can go to fix those ugly bits. It's a chance to redeem yourself. I like that.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202728.21/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323060839-20190323082839-00492.warc.gz

""We&apos;ve got a baseball stadium in the way now and a giant four-story apartment complex,"" he sighs. ""It&apos;s just constantly changing. Some changes are good, some are bad. It&apos;s just the reality of Nashville these days.""For many folks who&apos;ve lived in Music City for at least half a decade, as Leahey has, the dizzying pace of commercial development is a frequent topic of conversation. But all that stuff is merely a backdrop for his perspective on change. In years past, the singer-songwriter might&apos;ve opted for a cup of coffee, but today he&apos;s nursing a kale smoothie instead. Caffeine is one of many things that he&apos;s stopped fooling with. He did, after all, survive the removal of a brain tumor that could very well have taken his hearing, or his life. And Leahey spends much of his earnest, meticulously tuneful new album, Skyline in Central Time, marking the distance he&apos;s come from frivolous, youthful attitudes and fixating on things of more lasting importance.Those who know their U.S. time zones might recognize that his new album title also bears a passing resemblance to Bob Dylan&apos;s Nashville Skyline and Todd Snider&apos;s East Nashville Skyline. That&apos;s certainly no coincidence. In addition to leading his roots-rock outfit the Homestead, Leahey is also a music journalist, contributing to this publication and numerous others over the past decade, and along the way, learning the value of musical associations. It never hurts to subtly reference standard-setters of previous generations. Following your diagnosis, you had months to ponder how the surgery might affect your life and your ability to make music. You channeled a sense of urgency into your song ""When the Hinges Give."" How else did that urgency find its way into your musical life?When I came out of the operation, it definitely did light a fire under my ass. This is our third release. The first two were very homemade. They were co-produced by me. I probably spend more on my mortgage payments than I spent on those albums. And the plan was always, ""Why spend all your money right now? What are you going to have when the time comes to do a big album?"" When I got that diagnosis, I was worried that I wasn&apos;t gonna get the chance to do a big album. If I came out of it but I didn&apos;t have my hearing in my right ear, it would&apos;ve changed everything about my playing career and my journalism career.This album was totally complete in January 2015 and I went around and took meetings with labels and took a long time. I didn&apos;t wanna do what I did in the past, which was put it out on my own, put it on iTunes and say, ""Yay, it&apos;s up."" I wanted to get it placed well, given everything that went into it and given the knowledge I have that it can all stop.It seemed like you had a difficult time adjusting to the disruption in your music career. Didn&apos;t you head out on the road just a few months into your recovery?Two and a half months afterwards. It was very, very stupid. I booked that tour myself in the weeks leading up to the operation, because I wanted something that I had to get better for. I figured that if I had those plans, I would have to be OK for it. Because you promise your players money and they&apos;re taking time off of work. But you just can&apos;t go out on the road in February and tour the Midwest and New England like we did and have a hole in your head. So I came back from that and kind of had a new recovery process. I set myself back a bit. And that&apos;s when I made the choice to go back to the drawing board and chase down the big break not on the road, try to get a producer on board and do a big album.Your wife lived all this with you. What has she made of the way you&apos;ve told these stories in your songwriting?""When the Hinges Give,"" she thinks that&apos;s a really sad song. I think it&apos;s a happy song. That song is the most explicit about what happened.We had two and a half months where this operation was looming, and we didn&apos;t want to spend too much time worrying about it, but we also didn&apos;t want to just be flippant and not think about it. You don&apos;t want to ruin the time that you have together that could be your last time together, or could be my last time hearing my wife&apos;s voice in stereo hearing.Your producer Ken Coomer was recovering from his own health crisis around the same time that you were. What sort of environment did that create in the studio?He was taking medication like I was. I had my alarm that would go off every couple hours. It played Ricky Nelson&apos;s ""Hello Mary Lou,"" and that was my signal to take my pills.He had just opened up his new studio called Cartoon Moon, which is in his backyard, like, two blocks away from here. We were the first clients to use that. I think he, like me, was excited about a new phase of his career, doing something that was costly and kind of scary to do, but he&apos;d always wanted to do it. Now that he had a new lease on life, for lack of a better way to put it, he wanted to go ahead and do it. He was exploring the new terrain of his studio, and I was exploring what it felt like to be in the studio again. I was still very much getting better. My hair was growing back in the back.Didn&apos;t Ken Coomer suggest that you consider hiring a bunch of big-name Nashville players?Yeah.You know how things work: when your album credits are a who&apos;s who list of musicians, that&apos;s a useful talking point. You could be sitting here, reeling off names to me. But you didn&apos;t choose to go that route. Why?A lot of current music coming out of this town can sound similar, and I think it&apos;s because a lot of the exact same people play on it. You have plenty of people who rely on a rotating crew of maybe 30 players who play on everything, and I didn&apos;t want that. I thought this album came from a special enough place that I needed to have more of me on there. So I used these people who at the time were my band. It allowed me to play plenty of lead guitar, which I probably wouldn&apos;t have if we&apos;d had Rob McNelly or somebody like that playing guitar. He&apos;s better than me, but he doesn&apos;t sound like me.  It was important to me to drive the album not just as a vocalist, but as an instrumentalist as well. Ken Coomer wound up playing drums. That was not the original plan, but our drummer quit two weeks prior to going into the process. But I think if it&apos;d been ""Andrew and the A-list Nashville Cats,"" it wouldn&apos;t really have been Andrew and the Homestead.As for not having a ""who&apos;s who"" list on the album, we have sort of our own version of it. Courtney Jaye, who&apos;s a great songwriter I played with for years as her guitarist, she does harmonies on ""Penitentiary Guys."" And Jill Andrews, also local, she does harmonies on a couple things. I look up to those people more than I would some great sideman who I don&apos;t know.Speaking of narratives, the fact that you survived a brain tumor to play music again has been a hook in a good bit of the journalistic coverage you&apos;ve received. What&apos;s it like being on the other side of that equation?Knowing it&apos;s a good story?Yeah.I&apos;m worried about overusing that story. Not because I mind talking about it. I definitely don&apos;t. It has a good ending, so I&apos;m happy to share it. But you don&apos;t want to lean too heavily on your own trials and tribulations, because then you come off like a jerk. You come off like a person who&apos;s asking for reparations from people who had nothing to do with you getting sick.Reparations? You mean sympathy?Yeah. You&apos;re demanding their empathy or their time. Or their ink. And nobody owes me anything. I don&apos;t want that story to be the only selling point. But it has helped open some doors. It&apos;s given me something to talk about, other than that I&apos;m a guy in Nashville who has long hair and a beard and I tour all the time and play music. And me being a journalist, I can&apos;t overlook that fact. [Coming away with a story to tell] is the silver lining of the whole thing.I read that your mom taught classical voice lessons.She was a voice major in college, and a couple years prior to me coming along was a struggling pro classical vocalist and would do church services and weddings, that kind of thing. She taught music when my older brother was born and then switched over to teaching English and history when I was around. She definitely comes from that classical world.And you received classical instruction and sang in a chorus.She would not have let me do it any other way.Tom Petty is one of your foremost influences, and I was thinking about how your singing style compares with his. His singing can be so acidic, or he&apos;ll veer into sung-spoken rock & roll jive.It&apos;s not pretty sounding.Definitely not clean, crisp enunciation. But there are things you do, like sustaining notes with vibrato, that made me wonder what you&apos;ve made use of from your classical training and what you had to unlearn in developing your vocal style.I did classical music all throughout high school. I was in bands as well, but the kind of criticism I got during that time was that I sound like a chorus kid playing guitar. Chorus is just not a cool thing in high school. It&apos;s not the most rock and roll thing. But I didn&apos;t care. It was great.This was, of course, before Glee.Of course. After college, I tried out for the Julliard Chorale in New York City as a community member. My roommate worked there, and he said, ""Hey, they need guys in this choir."" I got in and it was great. But I think that was the peak of that classical world for me, and it was quite clear that that wasn&apos;t what I wanted to do. A good performance in that world is doing the song exactly how it&apos;s written. It doesn&apos;t really account for how the acoustics might sound different in a room one night, so you turn an instrument up.How&apos;d you find your thing?In college I tried to start that. I had a band that was more punky. I think it was me trying to strip all the classical tendencies out of my voice. Later I went back and added what I think is just natural. Vibrato helps keep me on pitch, and if I&apos;m gonna do a three-hour marathon gig, it&apos;s just more natural for me to sing that way. It is not the most, I guess, rock & roll voice. I don&apos;t know who it would sound like. I get told I sound like the guy from the Gin Blossoms a lot, which I don&apos;t mind. I like the Gin Blossoms. You followed your older brother into guitar lessons. Did you take cues from his musical taste too?One hundred percent. My dad&apos;s a great dude, but he&apos;s a blue-collar businessman. He&apos;s not a rock & roll guy. And my mom is a classical lady and she loves [opera singer] Kathleen Battle and stuff like that. My brother had to do all that research on his own, kick down those doors on his own, and I got to walk through with him. I grew up in the Eighties and Nineties, and he was into a lot of hair metal, which, I guess, those vocalists kind of sound like classical vocalists at times as well. He introduced me to a world that went beyond my parents&apos; oldies records. It was a great lesson, that you can think for yourself and you don&apos;t have to do what everyone else says all the time.Did he turn you on to Tom Petty?No. I liked Tom Petty. Growing up I would hear him alongside Bruce Hornsby or Don Henley on pop radio. I don&apos;t really know when Tom Petty took hold. I think it was when I was living up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, working at Allmusic.com and that live anthology came out. I don&apos;t think I realized how good of a band they were, how consistent of a band. Something about it flipped a switch for me and it was all I listened to. It&apos;s still all I listen to.I play an annual Tom Petty tribute show for charity, and playing those songs, they&apos;re so easy. There&apos;s nothing really ornate. There are no challenging guitar parts, apart from maybe ""American Girl."" The whole crowd can sing along. There&apos;s something immediately gratifying about hearing that kind of music. Plus he was a rock & roll frontman who could have hits on pop radio, could have hits on modern rock radio, and he&apos;s aged in this very smart way. I would love to meet him one day.You&apos;ve been into music-making for a long time, but you also studied journalism in college and landed jobs in that field after school. Have there been times when you were torn between which of the two career paths to take more seriously?I think the only time when I even considered putting anything above playing music was right after college, when all my friends were going to law school or going to backpack around Europe. They all had plans and I didn&apos;t have anything. This offer came through to intern at Spin magazine, which was my dream. I took that job rather than continuing to tour around with my band. In hindsight, I wish I hadn&apos;t. I think I was just young and scared about not having any money. I was getting good journalism gigs, so I chased that path for a bit. . . I was having a hard time knowing that I wanted to play music and could play music and [writing about] other people who had the balls to do it. They didn&apos;t have retirement plans, but I did. I felt like I needed to do it.Every article I&apos;ve read about you describes you as both a musician and journalist. Both roles are usually spelled out right there in the headline.Really? Yeah. Haven&apos;t you noticed?No. I think it just finds its way in, and I&apos;m glad. It&apos;s an uncommon thing, and I&apos;ve tried to walk that line. I don&apos;t want to paint myself into a corner, but I have in a number of respects.What difference does it seem to make if people think of you as doing both?I&apos;d be worried a lot of people would think that any headway I&apos;ve made on the music performance side of things is a result of connections I&apos;ve made as a writer — and perhaps it is, but I don&apos;t want them to attribute it all to that. And I want to try to avoid conflicts of interest when I can. My fear is I&apos;m gonna run into a person whose album I&apos;ve totally trashed at one point in time and they&apos;re gonna kick my ass. Generally I don&apos;t do that kind of journalism anymore. It&apos;s more features.Less reviewing.Yeah.In your journalistic work, you sometimes interact with musicians atop the hierarchy of popularity, critical claim and commercial success, but you&apos;re also intimately acquainted with the reality of the working musician. Your song ""Silver Linings"" describes a sparsely attended club show. It seems like seeing those disparities up close could make you cynical.I try not to be, but I think I am. I mean, ""Silver Linings"" in verse two I talk about a woman. I used Margo Price as the idea for that character. That was back when she was playing gigs at the 5 Spot to, like, 20 people, if that. Now she&apos;s killing it.At this moment, where do feel like you are on the spectrum of harsh realism to idealism?Oh, man. One hundred percent at the harsh realism polarity, while keeping my eyes on the idealistic side. You know, there are people like Margo Price or Jason Isbell, people who weren&apos;t given anything.  Their parents aren&apos;t rich. They had to just go and get it, and it&apos;s worked. It&apos;s worked because it&apos;s real. That&apos;s why it resonates.  So, it can happen. I think there&apos;s something to be said for just doggedly pursuing it.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202161.73/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319224005-20190320010005-00083.warc.gz
79,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/angaleena-presley-on-new-album-being-a-country-radio-whistleblower-119233/,"Two of Angaleena Presley's most beloved items sit in her bedside drawer: a card from her hero Loretta Lynn, and a joint, whose twin was cremated in the pocket of mentor and songwriting partner Guy Clark.""When he passed away, I took [Clark's caretaker and companion] Joy some cornbread,"" Presley tells Rolling Stone Country, sipping on tea at an East Nashville coffee shop in a black baseball hat and T-shirt with the word ""squirrels "" written across the front three times in neon, like a sign for a rodent nudie bar. ""She was like, 'I need you to do me a favor. I need you to roll me a joint.' So I rolled it, and then she asked me to roll another. She put one in Guy's pocket, and I have the other. I don't know what to do with it. If I were Guy, I would have gotten in the car and blazed it then and there. But I'm not Guy.""Clark, toking from the great beyond, might beg to differ. Wrangled, Presley's second LP, is a shot fired back at the Music Row machine that has made it impossible for voices like hers – honest, direct and, yes, female – to succeed on radio. Six years after the debut of the Pistol Annies, her trio with Miranda Lambert and Ashley Monroe, she's yet to sign a major label deal, even after the critical success of her first solo offering, American Middle Class. And it's not for lack of trying, either: the Kentucky native and actual coal miner's daughter never set out to be a Nashville rebel. In fact, she wanted in. As she sings on ""Outlaw,"" ""I don't want to be an outlaw, I don't want to be a renegade / I wanna be a straight-shootin', high fallutin' rider on the hit parade."" ""I don't know that anyone wakes up and sets out to be an underdog – you just kind of are,"" she says, speaking softly, like someone who knows the coffee shop etiquette well. In fact, if you came to this café on any normal day that Presley is in town, you might be able to spot her chugging away on her laptop after dropping her son off at school, drinking something hot and maybe wearing a Minecraft T-shirt. She likes video games: it feels good to win. These days, what makes Presley an outlaw is how unwilling she is to conform to what works on country radio – and her particular penchant for telling the truth, even if that truth isn’t quite so pretty. Her characters get pregnant and pop pills: like Brandy Clark, she talks about what happens after those romantic small-town nights on the dock with the crickets a-chirpin' and condoms a-breakin'. She sees the secrets and the slime beneath the surface, and the reality that trounces carelessly away at dreams, like a toddler stomping on some bubble wrap. But there was a point, when she was promoting American Middle Class, when she realized she wasn't always being as honest as she could be. ""When I put out my last record, the first question I kept getting asked was, 'What do you think about the fact that women aren't on the country charts?'"" she says. ""And in my head I wanted to say, 'I don't know, and it's pissing me off!' But I would give these generic answers: 'It's cyclical, it's all going to come back around.' It made me mad because I lied to people. I wasn't honest about how I was feeling. I was a minion, and what I realized over time was that I was perpetuating this problem by not talking about it.""On Wrangled, she doesn't just talk about it: she deconstructs it to the very bits and bones, taking a skewer to it as well. ""Country,"" the song that inspired the trajectory of the album, is a blast at the genre's worst clichés and tropes. Written after her then-publisher rejected a batch of tracks that didn't jive with the bro-friendly climate, it's a spitfire satire of just how far country radio has jumped the shark. Yet, somehow, she's the one still swimming in infested waters.""I went home and was real sad. So I listened to country radio,"" she says, then adding, deadpan, ""well, for five minutes. I just took all of those trends that were happening – the arena roar and, 'Let's make a list of things that country people are supposed to do in life!' and say the word 'country' 75 times, and I wrote this song and was like, 'Well here, will you pitch this? Will you give this a shot?' He didn't think it was very funny."" Though ""Country"" doesn't set the sonic tone for the record ­– it's spat out rapid fire to a Dick Dale-goes-Ramones beat with a verse from rapper and Alabama native Yelawolf that calls out Sturgill Simpson and bemoans the absence of Dwight Yoakam on the radio – it's the most direct thematic clue to what's to come. ""She's a stand-up artist,"" Yelawolf says. ""She had a kick-ass attitude in the studio. It was before noon when the whiskey bottle got cracked. Luckily, I had already laid my verse. I was useless by 1.""Tracks like ""High School,"" ""Wrangled"" and the Wanda Jackson co-write ""Good Girl Down"" do double duty: the pettiness of the teenage years act as a parable for the pettiness of Music Row, and the pressures of Music Row as a parable of the crushing defeat so many witness every day, when their fantasies don't match their realities. Presley's felt it all, as a female artist fighting to move the charts or score a record deal, and as a mother who's had to sacrifice PTA meetings for riding in the back of a dirty van to a show where she may or may not break even. Still, for as much rejection as she'd already faced, she still agreed to shop some of Wrangled's songs around to labels and various industry folk, finding herself in a familiar position – i.e., once again coming up empty. ""They were like,  'I don't know, I hear something bigger here! But let's wait, slow down,'"" she says. ""I had to, again, go through the process of 'pick me! pick me!' and then, you know what? I got, 'We love it so much, but we don't know what to do with it.' Or, 'We've already got two girls on the label.' Which, ok? Your quota is met? Is that a general rule? Because guess what guys? That's against the law. I don't understand why that doesn't apply.""Presley took the record to Thirty Tigers instead (""I'm not throwing myself to the wolves anymore,"" she recalls deciding), and put together a collection that tries to make sense of an unfair and broken system, where talent gets you nowhere near as far as testosterone. ""Mama I Tried,"" inspired by Merle Haggard's classic ""Mama Tried,"" charts her battle to play the game and pretty up, but is less a sigh of defeat and more of a permanent battle cry, with some of the sharpest country-rock guitar never heard on radio. Her manager, Charlie, now has ""Mama I Tried"" tattooed on her arm. ""She's 35 and doesn't have kids,"" Presley says. ""She's career-minded, and perfectly fine with that."" ""Making the decision to be the whistleblower for country radio lunacy is either going to sink me or allow me to fly. But at least I'll know I've been honest""Songs like ""Dreams Don't Come True,"" the mournful and wickedly smart album opener co-written with Monroe and Lambert, charts a Nashville fall from grace even more directly – and manages to parody pop success as much as it fetishizes it.  ""I'd make hit records, and get hooked on drugs,"" she sings, ""but I wound up pregnant, and strung out on love."" Presley was hanging out with her two Annies when the track was created (""We never really make an appointment to write songs, we make an appointment to drink beer and somehow along the way songs get written,"" she says), and it was Monroe who pushed her to be even more frank.""What I had was, 'when dreams don't come true,''"" she recalls. ""And Ashley was like, 'You don't need that when in there.' It's just, dreams don't come true.'"" A few minutes later, Presley gets a group text in the coffeeshop: it's Monroe and Lambert, and it cracks the seriousness in her face into a smile. ""Their ears musta been burning,"" she says. But there are layers of redemption, too. The gorgeous ""Groundswell,"" written with Ian Fitchuk, is on ode to making things work organically. For her, it's a fan base, but it could be for anyone who builds things from the bottom up. ""Angaleena writes what she knows and from as real a place as anyone,"" says Fitchuk. ""'Groundswell' is somewhat of a love song to the people who come out to shows and support her cause. Angaleena is fearless when it comes to speaking her mind and opening up her heart.""Presley crafted the cheeky murder ballad ""Only Blood"" with fellow Kentucky renegade Chris Stapleton (""Even he doesn't get played on the radio, and he sells more records than Beyoncé""), whose wife Morgane appears on the track, but the album's most poignant collaboration is ""Cheer Up Little Darling,"" which was Clark's last co-write before his passing last year. Featuring Shawn Camp on Clark's guitar and mandola, it begins with the Texas legend speaking some of the lyrics. ""Seems like a tight spot, but it's just a loose end,"" he says. Presley was there in Clark's final days, singing the song to her mentor once he'd moved to hospice, arranging his shaving kit or fetching his hat. Among many things, she credits him with giving her permission to admit her talents. ""He knew he was the best songwriter in town, and he owned it with such grace,"" she says. ""And I'm a good writer. I can admit that now."" Clark had Number One songs in his day, but not when he sang them himself – for as much as he was admired and revered, he wasn't exactly a household name. It's a direction that Presley is more comfortable with these days, and is fast becoming the only feasible option for many women like her who are refusing to pander to country radio, when they know that, even if they did, it probably wouldn't work anyway. Even at her superstar level, her Pistol Annies mate Lambert hasn't had a hit from her most recent release, The Weight of These Wings, and, as a double album full of introspection, it doesn't seem like that was even the goal to begin with. ""You can't fix things until you admit they are broken,"" Presley says, ""and on this record I am admitting I am broken. The system is broken. Brandy Clark: same story. Kacey Musgraves: same story. Sunny Sweeny: same story. Ashley Monroe. The list goes on and on. It's doesn't make sense. Making the decision to be the whistleblower for country radio lunacy is either going to sink me or allow me to fly. But at least I'll know I've been honest. Which is what I'm good at."" However that whistleblowing pans out, it will most certainly make Presley an outlaw. Wrangled is a conversation starter, and a lesson, too – if you stop worrying about pleasing country radio, you may not make millions, but you'll make art. An un-smoked joint, like a little rolled baton, sits by her bedside as a reminder.""I am really nice and passive, and I don't have the courage to be an outlaw,"" she says. ""But I have the courage to tell the truth. If that lands me in the outlaw pile, then hell, I'll party with them all night long.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202672.57/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322155929-20190322181929-00080.warc.gz
80,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/aretha-franklin-dead-6-best-country-performances-711109/,"Aretha Franklin was the Queen of Soul, but she was also an interpreter of songs from all genres, including country and folk music. Franklin died Thursday at 76 after a bout with pancreatic cancer, leaving behind a catalog that showcased her diverse range. Here are six of her best country renditions.

""Gentle on My Mind"" (1969)
Written by John Hartford, ""Gentle on my Mind"" was one of the most omnipresent songs of the late Sixties. Glen Campbell popularized it. Dean Martin turned it into an easy-listening hit. But it was Aretha Franklin who stretched the song far beyond its origins, slowing the tempo and swapping the rolling guitar arpeggios for thick, soulful stabs of piano. The result wasn't exactly a hit — it quickly fell from the charts in 1969, right around the time she released her seventh Number One single, ""Share Your Love With Me"" — but it showed the range of her influences, which reached far beyond the world of R&B.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xvEmxDZLec

""Cold Cold Heart"" (1964)
Hank Williams was several months shy of a divorce when ""Cold Cold Heart"" became a hit in 1951. Franklin's own interpretation followed in 1964, ignoring the depressed twang of Williams' original and filling the void with waltzing, woozy blasts of gospel. Come for the lovely combo of trombone and church organ, the latter of which was tracked by the same keyboardist who appeared on Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited one year later. Stay for Franklin's vocal performance, which packs more fire-and-brimstone punch than a Baptist sermon.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSTKx2pyDd0

""Night Life"" (1967)
For a song whose bridge urged everyone within earshot to ""listen to the blues,"" Willie Nelson's ""Night Life"" never sounded half as bluesy as it did on 1967's Aretha Arrives. Franklin recorded the song with a broken elbow, channeling her discomfort into three minutes of pained, powerhouse singing. She doesn't just bend her blue notes during the song's final stretch; she bruises them, proudly owning her night-owl status along the way. ""It's my life,"" Franklin sings, daring anyone to try and put her to bed before sunrise.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bZMIQRek8I

""If I Had a Hammer"" (1965)
Modeled after the loose, live vibe of her jazz-club gigs, Yeah! found Franklin adding guitarist Kenny Burrell to her backup band. When she suggested the group cover a contemporary hit like ""Puff the Magic Dragon,"" producer Clyde Otis convinced them to tackle ""If I Had a Hammer"" instead. Rather than model her version after Peter, Paul and Mary's performance, though, Franklin took her cues from the late Sam Cooke, who included the song on 1964's Sam Cooke at the Copa. The result is a percussive, poignant tribute to one of her soul-singing influences. ""She was crazy for Sam,"" Otis says in the biography Respect: The Life of Aretha Franklin. ""In fact, we were in the studio on some session when word came that Sam had been killed … Aretha got up and left and didn't come back for a week. I certainly understood.""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FkvT03wwg

""The Weight"" (1969)
Franklin owned the R&B charts in 1969, sending five different singles — including this reimagination of the Band's signature song— into the Top 5. The Staple Singers had similar plans, covering ""The Weight"" on the group's first album for Stax Records and, years later, appearing in The Last Waltz. Their version pushed the song into gospel territory, while Franklin's own performance mixed the stomp of urban soul with the sweat and sex of rock & roll. Duane Allman plays the song's moaning riff on slide guitar.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGdxpnGK2o4

""You Are My Sunshine"" (1967)
This country classic was already ubiquitous by the time Franklin released her version in 1967. Of all its covers and reinterpretations, though, there's perhaps no take as anticipatory as Franklin's ""You Are My Sunshine,"" whose two-minute, free-form introduction is largely a cappella. When the song kicks into second gear around the halfway mark, the effect is both unexpected and exhilarating, like a parked muscle car suddenly springing toward highway speed. This recording is a family affair, too, with sisters Carolyn and Erma Franklin adding their harmonies throughout.

81,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/aretha-franklin-sings-bill-anderson-i-may-never-get-heaven-712236/,"In the summer of 1979, Conway Twitty earned his 22nd Number One hit with ""I May Never Get to Heaven,"" written by longtime friends Bill Anderson and Buddy Killen. Anderson had been enshrined in the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame four years earlier, but has continued to have hits into the 21st century, including the multi-award-winning ""Whiskey Lullaby,"" written with Jon Randall. ""I May Never Get to Heaven,"" however, took a long, circuitous route to the top of the charts, yet along the way ended up being recorded by numerous artists — including the late Aretha Franklin, who cut it on the 1967 LP, Take It Like You Give It, her final album on Columbia Records before her move to Atlantic, the label for which she would record her most enduring hits.

Having previously recorded such country classics as Hank Williams' ""Cold, Cold Heart,"" Franklin's 1967 output on Columbia and Atlantic also included her versions of songs by Willie Nelson (""Night Life"") and Jimmie Davis (""You Are My Sunshine""). By the time she cut her sublimely tender version of ""I May Never Get to Heaven,"" it had been recorded by Wanda Jackson, and also relegated to the b-sides of singles by both B.J. Thomas and Don Gibson – whose version directly inspired Twitty's. Franklin, whose gospel background informed so much of her material, delivered a truly mournful version of the heartbreaking ballad.

Anderson would write the lyrics of ""I May Never Get to Heaven,"" while Killen composed the melody, and according to Anderson's autobiography, Killen told the songwriter, ""Anderson, everything you write sounds like you stole the tune from the Baptist hymnal."" Killen's observation, however, was less about the song's vaguely spiritual content and more to point out that many of the young songwriter's melodies at the time were strikingly similar.

""I was living in Nashville, but I really hadn't moved here to stay,"" Anderson would say later. ""I had to leave and go back home to Georgia and finish some college courses that I thought I had finished but I found out that I hadn't. And I'd been dating this girl and we'd broken up and I was just sittin' around my little one-room apartment just thinking about our relationship. That lyric was pretty much right from the heart. 'I may never get to heaven, but I almost did one time.'""

Anderson, whose biggest songwriting successes were in country, welcomed a version of one of his songs by an artist from a different genre. In Jake Brown's book Nashville Songwriter, Anderson says, ""I accept all of them, because I think a true artist is anybody [who] can trace a picture; it takes a great artist to paint one. And when I heard Aretha Franklin sing 'I May Never Get to Heaven,' or some of these wild, off-the-wall renditions that are so different, I take it as a compliment, I really do. It's like this artist cared enough about what I wrote to put their stamp on it, and you don't get paid a better compliment.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203547.62/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325010547-20190325032547-00288.warc.gz

But McBryde could also be talking about ""A Little Dive Bar in Dahlonega,"" her breakthrough ode to small pleasures and hard-won faith that's steadily climbing up the country charts.After spending the better part of the past 15 years playing grimy roadhouses and sports bars, Ashley McBryde, 34, is emerging as one of the most exciting new voices in country music, a whiskey-swilling high priestess of dive bars whose radically lyrics-driven, rock-leaning approach to mainstream country commands instant attention.Produced by Jay Joyce (Eric Church), Girl Going Nowhere is heavy on hooks and set to a radio-friendly blend of heartland riffs and pop-country. But it's also a gently left-field statement for Nashville, a stubbornly retro country-rock album that name-drops fringe figures like Townes Van Zandt instead of Merle Haggard.""The first thing that immediately grabbed me about Ashley was of course her voice,"" says Eric Church, who invited the singer onstage to perform her song ""Bible and a .44"" with him last year. ""I heard soul, heart, pain, grit, regret, vulnerability and edge. As I dug into her songs it became immediately apparent why I hear those emotions: it was her songwriting. Those emotions that flowed from her voice were also pouring out of her pen.""The foundation of McBryde's old-fashioned country-rock can be traced back to her upbringing in Mammoth Spring, Arkansas (population 963), a rural community deep in the Ozark Mountains that did not yet have Internet access, or even cable television, when McBryde and her five siblings were growing up in the Eighties on their family's cattle farm. One of McBryde's new songs, ""Radioland,"" chronicles her upbringing via her hometown's FM dial, which picked up local oldies and country stations and provided the community with entertainment, news and church services. ""Everything I ever needed came out of a radio and a dashboard,"" she says. ""My Mount Rushmore of what was cool came out of a radio – Trisha Yearwood, Patty Loveless, Mark Chesnutt.""As a child, McBryde, who was writing songs by age 12, soaked up her family's musical favorites: the Beatles and Karen Carpenter from her mother, Pat Benatar from her sister, hip-hop and modern alt-rock from her brother, and bluegrass and classic country like Haggard, Kris Kristofferson and John Denver from her father. The McBryde children were primarily raised by their stay-at-home mom while their dad, a part-time preacher at the local Church of Christ, would be gone for weeks at a time supporting the family by working as an ER physician on the other side of the state.  ""Growing up missing him like I did, little did I know that my family would now miss me like I missed him,"" she says. ""I used to begrudge and hate him for it, because he wasn't around, but now I get it.""McBryde went to college at Arkansas State, where she majored in music, specializing in French horn, conducted the school's marching band, and became the vocalist for the jazz band.As a result, McBryde brings an unusually well-rounded musical sensibility to country music, a classically-trained orchestral instrumentalist who loves blues and rock & roll but ultimately gravitates toward folk-leaning singer-songwriters. ""You limit yourself to one genre, you're a fucking idiot,"" she says.‪In conversation, McBryde repeatedly breaks into song, singing snippets by an impressive range of artists including Kenny Loggins, Roger Miller, Loudon Wainwright, Hayes Carll, Lucinda Williams, Ricky Skaggs and Patty Griffin.She's a huge fan of Griffin's music, in particular. ""Oh my god, 'Up to the Mountain,'"" she says, referencing her favorite Griffin original, ""that song kept me from drinking Windex for a year and a half.""""I had this soul-sucking job,"" she explains, ""I knew when I went to work everyday that I was changing zero lives."" After college, McBryde had moved to Memphis, where she worked as an operations manager at a Guitar Center while driving up to Arkansas for grueling gigs in biker bars at night. ""Where I'm from, there are two things to do after a certain age: make babies or make meth.""Most of McBryde's family still lives in Arkansas, but she's been able to visit less and less lately. ""I feel like all of our dreams are on my shoulders,"" she says. The singer's hometown still looms large on Girl Going Nowhere, particularly on ""Livin' Next to Leroy,"" which shines a light on a rural America epidemic that McBryde wishes more people were willing to address.""Where I'm from, there are two things to do after a certain age: make babies or make meth,"" she says. ""I don't think anybody else is willing to talk about it."" In the song, which tells the story of a junkie who provides a safe-house for younger addicts in the community, McBryde delivers a pointed line: ""In the dark side of the country,"" she sings, ""it ain't bonfires, it ain't beer.""""In country music, we spend a lot of time talking about beer and having fun and bonfires, but there's a big meth problem with our listeners and our companions, and it deserves to be spoken about,"" she says. ""There is this great party side to being from a rural area and from being in country music, but there's also this other animal that exists among us all the time. A secret gets bigger and nastier the longer you don't talk about it. The sooner you do talk about it, it can become a shadow of what it once was.""Country music fans have been spoon-fed music for years, like, 'This is great: eat it,'"" she continues. ""But there's this other part out there.""""Leroy"" is the type of message song that McBryde is most interested in singing. She admits that she was initially hesitant to release ""Dahlonega"" as her first single because it lacked the type of obvious larger meaning that she's keen on communicating. ""It's not the best song on the record. It's not the most important, doesn't give the biggest message.""With fame approaching and her life changing, the constant for McBryde remains her band, an inseparable gang of players who serve as McBryde's coworkers, best friends and family. ""We do everything together,"" she says, before illustrating her point. ""Watch this."" Shocking the rest of an unsuspecting dive bar, she begins yelling a pirate sea shanty: ""Help me Bob, there's a bully in the alley!"" ""Way hey, bully in the alley!"" chants her band in unison in return. They're seemingly always nearby, this time waiting for their boss to wrap up her interview so they can resume drinking.But before that happens, McBryde wants to now share the best advice she ever received, given to her by journeyman country singer Johnny Lee. McBryde was opening up for the ""Lookin' for Love"" singer at the Goats, Music and More Festival in Lewisburg, Tennessee, in 2010, a big gig for her at the time, when Lee pulled her aside.""You should know that you might try to do this the rest of your life and never ever make it big, and it won't matter to anybody,"" he told her, ""but if you ever, ever quit, it will matter to you the rest of your life.""McBryde pauses to toss the advice around in her head, pondering its profundity and quietly repeating it, verbatim, to herself.""Therapy is expensive,"" she says, looking up, ""whiskey is cheap.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205163.72/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326115319-20190326141319-00389.warc.gz
85,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/ashley-monroe-on-sexy-songs-writing-while-high-and-unattainable-crushes-630555/,"After the one-two traditional-country punch of 2013's Like a Rose and 2015's Grammy-nominated The Blade, both co-produced by Vince Gill and Justin Niebank, Ashley Monroe began working with über-producer Dave Cobb, whose Grammy-winning works for Jason Isbell and Chris Stapleton, among others, have redefined country and Americana music in recent years. Recorded at the historic RCA Studio A, where Cobb works in residence, the songs on Monroe's Sparrow perhaps owe a bit more to Smokey Robinson than the Smoky Mountains in some ways, bathed as they are in warm, luxuriant strings, still retaining the uncluttered twang of her East Tennessee upbringing yet also emphasizing an even more soulful tone than her previous efforts. Embracing unbridled sensuality, coming to grips with long-held grief (her father died from cancer when Monroe was 13) and understanding one's parents more deeply are subjects touched on throughout the luminous new record, mature themes well-suited to the LP's lush instrumentation. And while many of the songs on Sparrow – released not-so-coincidentally on 4/20 – were written in the heady haze of weed, they were ultimately recorded while Monroe was pregnant, where the only likely buzz was generated by Cobb's vintage recording equipment. Monroe gave birth to Dalton William Danks, her son with baseball player husband John Danks, in August 2017, retreating from songwriting during her pregnancy, during which she admits she did little other than eat and gain weight once the album was finished. Since then, however, she's been making up for it all, writing and stockpiling tunes that include efforts with her Pistol Annies cohorts Miranda Lambert and Angaleena Presley for a record Lambert said in 2017 could surface later this year. Monroe sat down with Rolling Stone Country recently to talk, among other subjects, sex, drugs and Kanye. She also details how her unborn child motivated her in the studio and recalls how a crush she had on a young songwriter, whose presence is featured throughout the new album, was thwarted by the discovery of his famous country-music boyfriend.Other than the fact that he has a pretty impeccable track record, what made you decide to work with Dave Cobb on this album?A lot of my favorite current artists right now are making music with him. I knew a little bit about him, but I didn't know him that well. I knew that he was interested [in making a record] as well, and I thought, ""Man, that just seems like a perfect fit."" It just seems kind of obvious, in a weird way. He's just so, I don't know… there's just something about him, there's something about his sound that I just love. I don't know how to explain it, but it's magic.The instrumentation is a little different from your previous records, especially the overwhelming presence of strings. Was there anything he did that really surprised you?A lot of the solos, or a lot of parts, are strings. I love that so much, that they actually have a part, it's not just mood. It’s like, here are the licks. We did get some bongos out at one point. That was fun. The Mellotron, I think it's on ""This Heaven"" and it's on ""Hands on You."" And the steel solos are not your normal steel solos. I listen to this album nonstop in my car. I have never, ever listened to myself. But I just love it so much and I love the songs. I call myself ""Kanye Monroe"" because I love myself in 2018. [Laughs] But I'm proud of it, I really am.Was there anything about being pregnant during recording that affected the way that you sang?I don't know. I was stuffy, but I think that's good on my sexy numbers. [Laughs] I felt different because I already felt stronger. I hadn't met my child but I felt different inside and felt different about myself. I was almost more comfortable in my skin, vulnerable in all the right places. I felt every line I sang one hundred percent because I was not doing anything you shouldn't do when you’re pregnant that would give you any sort of buzz! Everything was there, everything was very present. I sang the whole time with my hand on my stomach. I wasn't, like, mushy about it. But I felt a certain strength, knowing that I had another life inside of me. I was certain that Dalton could hear and understand if I ever hit a wrong note. I always sing harmony to the radio, but when I was pregnant and I would sing, I'd be like, ""You better hit it!"" It's like somebody was always listening. I was certain he was aware of pitch.Did you feel a different sort of vulnerability while singing some of the really personal songs on this record?I felt that on ""Daddy I Told You"" and ""Keys to the Kingdom"" and, well, on all of them. I felt I was coming at it with a new emotion. I don't know, even ""Orphan."" You know, now when I sing that, I think of him. I wrote it about the 13-year-old me. My dad died and my mother was MIA for a little bit, but came back. She did not die; she's alive and very much in my life. But singing that song pregnant was like a different pain [than] for a kid in that situation.You address your parents collectively, but also individually. It seems like the ones about your mother were a little more complicated, a little more nuanced than the ones about your dad.I believe that my dad can see me and is with me and protects me, but that door, in a way, is closed for now. That relationship status is on hold, we'll say. So, ""Daddy I Told You"" is almost like a letter to him with me checking in: ""Hey, this is me now."" My mother and I, I'm still learning her, the older I get and the more she's in my life. I mean, even seeing her as a grandmother and all that. But part of her went away when my dad went away because she loved him so much. And I get that, too. So I feel like I'll just keep on writing songs to my mom because it's one of the biggest relationships in my life, and I'll always write about those. When my mom kind of went away after Daddy died, she moved off to this exit, and it was between Knoxville and Nashville, in Rockwood. My husband and I were driving there a couple years back, and went past that exit. I kind of chuckled. That's when ""Mother's Daughter""came to me. [Sings] ""Gone away, Dixieland, gone away is the steady hand."" That whole chorus came out there. In that moment, it was like, ""Man, I'm so much like her!"" It's just ironic, and it's really funny that I ever gave her a hard time about anything, or that I do now or that I ever will. Because everything she does that gets on my nerves, is because I do it. I've just noticed that recently.There are some very poignant songs about your parents and then there are songs like ""Hands on You"" and ""Wild Love."" So let's talk about sex.[Laughs] Yeah, me and Jon Randall wrote ""Hands on You."" We were talking that day, and we both said let's just make it real, make it gritty. He and I both love Aimee Mann. We were talking about some of her funky lyrics, her way of saying stuff. So we just went weird with lines like ""innuendos indiscreet."" Women love it. All of my girlfriends, that's their favorite song. But it's [my husband] John's favorite song, too. All the dudes are like, ""I love this song.""""Wild Love"" explores some of that same territory and there's a memorable line about needing a stranger to ""pull my hair and call my name.""I always want to say ""gently"" because I have extensions! [Laughs] That one came to me in London. It was the first time I went over there and I thought that city was just so sexy and so beautiful and so amazing. Everything was just confident, and everyone, everything was just different in the most beautiful ways. I fell so madly in love with London. And that melody came to me at like three in the morning on my phone. I couldn't sleep, everything was off. It was haunting me the whole time. I sang it to my manager, ""Listen to this melody."" So when I got back, I had a writing appointment with Waylon Payne and Brendan Benson, who are two of my top favorite humans and songwriters and singers ever. We did ""Wild Love"" and then I think we wrote ""Paying Attention"" that same day.You released Sparrow on 4/20/ Coincidence.'Nuff said. [Laughs] Let the mic drop on that! The songs that I wrote when I wasn't pregnant, I was probably a little high when I wrote them. That's when I write the best. I'm inspired by it. I'm pro-that big time. Best medicine there is.What kind of a routine do you have with weed when you're writing?When I go write, I have a vape pen and I take a few puffs. My mind opens up, and there it goes. I start hearing these melodies, and words start coming out. People will say, ""Pot just makes me sink into the couch"" and I'm like, ""You're smoking Indica. It makes you melt."" My mom has lupus and she's got arthritis and she's got other degenerative neck pain. She's into edibles and they really, really help pain, which is cool. No side effects.How much have you written since the baby was born?I am on a writing streak right now. I do this pattern where I, and I think a lot of songwriters do, where they write, write, write  and then there's just nothing. It's almost like you have to live and then you have to absorb some things, some feelings, then you'll write. After I made this record I went home and I didn't do anything but eat. I gained 60 pounds. I ate everything I normally wouldn't eat. And I didn't write; I did not pick up a guitar. I barely hummed. I was down. And then after I had Dalton, I started getting inspired again. I'm more inspired as of right now than I've ever really felt. It's good to be fired up about music. I see that I need both in my life. I need my family and I need this side, too. I'm better for them. I'm better for myself when I do.The album closes with the breathtaking ""Keys to the Kingdom,"" which is sort of all about this subject, being inspired to make music. That's another co-write with Waylon Payne?Yes. I had that title just written in my phone. My husband and I own a river house about an hour and 40 minutes out of town, and Waylon had come and stayed out there one weekend. It was summer. His dad was Jody Payne, who played with Willie for years, and his mom was [""Help Me Make It Through the Night"" singer] Sammi Smith. He has this guitar, I'm pretty sure it was his dad's. Everyone's signed it, from [Kris] Kristofferson to Willie. The guitar is really magical. He brought that on the porch one early morning and we're drinking coffee. The sun was out, it was shining off of the river. And I was like, ""Keys to the Kingdom,"" I've dreamed that melody, and we just started writing it. [Sings] ""I was handed keys to the kingdom"" and he was like, ""I was given a haunted guitar"" and it just kinda poured out. Waylon is such a fantastic singer and songwriter. He's just really special. I was obsessed with him when he first put out his album, The Drifter. When was that?It came out in mid-2004.I had seen his picture on the wall, and I said, ""That's clearly who I'll be with!"" [Laughs] This is so random. So, all those years ago, I had just moved to Nashville and I saw he was going to be playing with his mom at the Opry. I walked in backstage. I had gotten all dressed up. I was all prepared to meet my future husband and his mother, all in one. But I went in and I saw Ty Herndon, who was his boyfriend at the time. I was like, ""Uh oh, he's not ever gonna love me, is he? [Laughs] But the weird thing is, I kind of dated two of his very best friends and that didn't work out, and now I'm back with Waylon. He was always the one. He was just my musical soulmate, as it turns out, not my actual soulmate. Every interview we've had usually ends with this same question: What's the status of the next Pistol Annies record?We've been writing. We went on the road recently and that was really the first time we've sat down with the intention to just write. We did once at Miranda's house, but sometimes we get to talking, we get distracted. But on the road a few weekends ago, we wrote like five that I'm so excited about. We still have that fire and that fight. There's something so magical about us. We were on the bus writing and we were reminded when we were together, like, literally there was a ""bzzzz,"" like a vibration. We were trying to tune the guitar, and all three of us had our phones, and we all had different tuner apps on our phones, and all of them were going haywire. It was like there's actual energy between us right now.What are the chances of getting that record this year?I don't know. I would love that and I think they would, too, but we've always been where we don't want to say it. We don't want to put too much pressure on ourselves, especially when we're all doing different things. But the time right now feels right. When we get excited, especially when the songs are coming as fast as they are… we already see it shaping into an album. So it's still really early, but I feel like we could turn it around. We'll see.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202572.7/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321213516-20190321235516-00239.warc.gz

""They&apos;re gonna die tryin&apos; a-track me down,"" Monroe sings in ""Monroe Suede,"" as she describes life as a 14-year-old on the run in a stolen pickup truck. She hints at the struggles of an out-of-wedlock pregnancy in ""Two Weeks Late"" and alludes to innocence lost in ""Morning After.""

She does show a softer side on ""She&apos;s Driving Me Out of Your Mind,"" lamenting an impending breakup at the hands of another woman.
Monroe co-wrote all the songs on the album, and teamed up with fellow country crooner Vince Gill to write ""You Ain&apos;t Dolly (And You Ain&apos;t Porter),"" a playfully antagonistic duet she sings with Blake Shelton.

She's a unique kind of crossover artist, writing hits for mainstream-minded artists like Jason Aldean one minute and chasing her own Americana muse the next. Talking with Chris Shiflett during the newest episode of Walking the Floor, she covers the full spread of her career, from her childhood days in the church choir to her current U.S. tour.

Sparrow finds Monroe making peace with the personal battles she waged during her childhood years.
""I grew up fast, and there was a lot that needed to be resolved,"" Monroe says of her adolescence, during which she lost her father to cancer when she 13 years old. She turned to songwriting as a means of therapy. Decades later, Monroe revisits many of those early songs on Sparrow, an album inspired by forgiveness, healing, self-resilience and the expansion of her own nuclear family. ""Dave [Cobb] said he kind of felt a release of the pain as I was making the record,"" she says, name-checking the album's all-star producer.

She's a proud fan of her own album.
Sparrow was recorded in January 2017 and released more than a year later, giving Monroe plenty of time to mull over the recordings in the interim. ""I listened to this record nonstop, the whole time I was pregnant,"" she admits. ""I was driving around in my car. I joked to Dave that I was 'Kanye Monroe' because I loved myself so much. I just rode around, blasting myself, which I've never done before.""

Before earning an audience with her own music, Monroe built a career as a behind-the-scenes songwriter.
""My first cut was a song I wrote when I was 19, but I was in my early 20s when it got cut,"" she tells Shiflett. ""It was Jason Aldean, 'The Truth.' It was a Number One song on country [radio]."" Monroe also co-wrote Miranda Lambert's ""Heart Like Mine,"" which topped the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in 2011. The two were both signed to Sony at the time, and they forged a friendship based upon a mutual respect of each other's tunes. ""At first, she didn't like me because I was another blonde girl singer,"" Monroe says of her Pistol Annies bandmate, ""but then she liked my songs, so we became friends.""

Monroe and Lambert formed the Pistol Annies while smoking pot after a camping trip.
""Her and I hung out all the time back then,"" says Monroe, who remembers taking a camping trip in Lambert's Airstream trailer sometime back in 2011. After logging a day or two in the outdoors, the two headed to Lambert's then-home in Oklahoma, where they spent an evening watching TV and listening to Angaleena Presley's music. Lambert, who'd never heard Presley before, was impressed. Around midnight, they decided to call Presley and propose the idea of forming a band together. ""She was like, 'Why are y'all calling me up at midnight?'"" Monroe remembers, laughing. ""Miranda was like, 'Do you wanna be in a band with us?' And [Angaleena]'s like, 'Y'all high?' And we were like, 'Yes, but we still want to be a band.'""

The secret to the Pistol Annies' success? A genuine appreciation for one another's opinion, as well as a lot of mutual respect.
""This [upcoming Annies] record more than ever, we are just in constant communication about the music,"" explains Monroe. ""All three of us have very distinctive sounds, but we're all fans of each other. I like it when Angaleena is like, 'I have a production idea,' because I'm gonna like it and it's gonna be different. We all really do equally contribute.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202711.3/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323020538-20190323042538-00159.warc.gz
88,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/backstage-with-taylor-swift-on-her-huge-summer-stadium-tour-75608/,"""Were you as sweaty as I was tonight?"" Taylor Swift asks as she takes a seat on one of the many padded blue tables in the NFL training room at New Jersey&apos;s MetLife Stadium. That would be a no: She just wrapped a seriously athletic two-hour show in which she breakdanced, led a psychedelic drum circle and jumped down from the stage to high-five hundreds of fans.
""It&apos;s kind of exhilarating, walking through a crazy, insane mob,"" she says. ""The most miraculous process is watching a song go from a tiny idea in the middle of the night to something that 55,000 people are singing back to you.""
Swift&apos;s Red tour documents her wild ride from twangy teen singer-songwriter to dubstep-dabbling pop megastar. The massive production – which includes a 190-foot stage with a catwalk and a staircase onstage, nine huge video screens and a dozen backup dancers – feels surprisingly intimate, partly because of Swift&apos;s habit of going on long confessional tangents.
""I am getting to the point where the only love worth being in is the love worth singing about,"" she says. ""Sitting on a bedroom floor crying is something that makes you feel really alone. If someone&apos;s singing about that feeling, you feel bonded to that person. That&apos;s the only way I can find an explanation for why 55,000 people would want to come see me sing.""
The New Immortals: Taylor Swift
While Swift designed the 2011 Speak Now tour in the vein of A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream, she took a new approach this year. ""I picture this taking place in New York City,"" she says of the stage show. ""And so you got you&apos;ve got high intensity excitement and you&apos;ve got the darkness of all of it and you&apos;ve got all the fleeting moments of reality, and it&apos;s a little bit less of a fairy tale.""
The show also includes openers that have included Ed Sheeran (who opens all shows of the tour), Austin Mahone and Joel Crouse. ""I want people&apos;s head spinning at everything they saw and heard,"" says Swift.
""She really has every single thing you could expect from a big show,"" says Sheeran, who adds he&apos;s had to adapt his set for Swift&apos;s audience. ""I&apos;ve stopped swearing so much when I perform, because there are a lot of young kids in the crowd.""
Sheeran has also faced the challenge of filling a stadium with only an acoustic guitar. ""I&apos;ve been trying to work out my own way of doing it,"" he says. ""My show is a lot more off-the-cuff [than Swift&apos;s]. I&apos;ll decide to play a song, like, two minutes before, so it&apos;s less regimented.""
Before tonight&apos;s show, Swift attended four fan meet-and-greets and ran through a quick soundcheck with special guest Patrick Stump, who rose onstage in an elevator to surprise fans with Fall Out Boy&apos;s ""My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)."" ""It&apos;s my jam!"" says Swift.
Adds Stump, ""She started talking to me about the hydraulics [of the elevator], and I&apos;m like, &apos;It&apos;s crazy how good at this you are. You know all your shit.&apos;""
Since her stadium gigs happen mostly on weekends, Swift has spent plenty of downtime lately at her new beachside mansion in Rhode Island. ""There have been a lot of kitchen dance parties with my girlfriends,"" she says. She&apos;s been listening to tons of Carly Simon (who just joined her onstage in Massachusetts) and devouring novels, from F. Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s Tender Is the Night to Gillian Flynn&apos;s Gone Girl and Jess Walter&apos;s Beautiful Ruins. ""They&apos;re great stories, and they kind of take you away,"" she says. And she&apos;s already putting together a wish list of collaborators for her fifth album: ""I&apos;m jumping in headfirst.""
After the show, her workday still isn&apos;t quite done. She has one more meet-and-greet scheduled in Club Red, a shrine decked out in photos of Swift and old stage costumes. This one is reserved for fans dressed in the most outrageous costumes: Several girls wear tutus, and there&apos;s one dude covered head to toe in red plastic Solo cups. The chatty room falls silent when Swift arrives at midnight. One young fan from Long Island starts crying in the corner. Soon, Swift hugs two girls from the Netherlands, who hand her some waffle-and-syrup cookies from back home. ""Oh, my God, I love these,"" Swift says with a gasp. ""Are these for me to keep?"" They nod.
Later, as the Dutch girls wait for a train back into New York, they&apos;re still buzzing. ""I&apos;m so happy,"" one of them says, staring at a photo of herself with Swift that she&apos;s already uploaded to Instagram. ""That was the greatest moment of my life.""
Here is the full Q&A from our interview with Swift:
Onstage, you discussed writing a lot of songs in your bedroom at 2 a.m. What&apos;s it like to go from that to playing it for a huge stadium?I think the most miraculous process is watching a song go from a tiny idea that you have in the middle of the night to a song that a group of 55,000 people is singing back to you so loudly that you can hear it louder than your own voice coming out of the speakers, in a concert in a stadium. And I think that for me, that&apos;s the final part of the process. You know, I&apos;m still so in love with songwriting because it&apos;s never the same. You never get the same fragment of information as an idea. It&apos;s never just a chorus or a first line – it&apos;s always something different. And to piece it together in the crossword puzzle that ends up being your song and have it end up here is so rewarding, you know.
You also talked about the ""fiery, difficult, complicated emotions"" that drive those songs. You seem very comfortable talking about those emotions at length onstage. I am getting to a point where the only love worth being in is the love worth singing about. And kind of mad love. I think that for me, when you experience something that&apos;s worth writing a song about, chances are it&apos;s the same kind of intense feeling that someone else has felt, and it has led them to be sitting on a bedroom floor crying, or walking through a crowded room feeling alone or feeling misunderstood by the person who&apos;s supposed to know them better than anybody else. Those are things that make you feel really alone, and if someone&apos;s singing a song about that feeling, then you feel bonded to that person, and I guess that&apos;s the only way I can find an explanation why 55,000 people would want to come see me sing.
The show gets pretty dark. During ""Red,"" there&apos;s a moment where what looks like blood is spilling across the video screens. Is that somebody&apos;s blood? Actually, no. I&apos;ve never been into shock value and gory and scaring people. It&apos;s actually paint, so it&apos;s actually just supposed to be the general concept of something red and something flowing – just red things. Like, there&apos;s red fabric, red paint being thrown against a wall. It&apos;s not blood. ""God, we went to Taylor&apos;s show – it was really violent!""
What did you do today? I was wondering what you do on a day when you play a show like this.It&apos;s a pretty hectic day. And it started with two really big meals. I eat a really big breakfast.
When is your first one?That&apos;s at 10 a.m. And then I drive to the venue, get to the venue. We did soundcheck with Patrick Stump from Fall Out Boy. I&apos;ve been so excited for it for so long, because that song has been my jam for a really long time. Anyways, I did soundtrack with Patrick Stump and ran a few things in the stadium and then went to catering and had a really big lunch.
What&apos;d you eat?I don&apos;t know, just whatever they have, because that&apos;s gotta carry me through pretty much the show and the meet-and-greets, because hair and makeup starts at 4:30, and then I have four different meet-and-greets before the show. And then before the show we have a huddle where one of us makes an inspirational speech. Patrick&apos;s the one who made it tonight, which was wonderful. And then we go and walk into a stadium and play a show for two hours.
After the Speak Now tour, this one even seems a little bigger. You have the levitating and the Victorian dresses and the chandeliers. Did you have a specific way of thinking on  what this tour would be like?I did, actually. I thought a lot about how this tour was going to be different from the Speak Now tour. I was really proud of the Speak Now tour, but I&apos;m proud of this tour for a different reason. When I was conceptualizing this tour from the very beginning, I thought about how if these two shows were to exist in two different worlds, I picture the Speak Now tour existing in a Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream/Romeo and Juliet-inspired fantasyland, and I picture this taking place in New York City. And so you&apos;ve got high intensity excitement and you&apos;ve got the darkness of all of it and you&apos;ve got all the fleeting moments of reality, and it&apos;s a little bit less of a fairy tale.
Ed Sheeran has opened all the shows on the tour, but you are also rotating lots of other openers like Austin Mahone, Joel Crouse, Florida Georgia Line – kind of like your own traveling festival.I have a pretty wide, eclectic taste in music, and I know my fans do too. We seem to have that in common. I want fans to leave the show at the end of the night with their heads spinning from everything they saw and heard. I want them to fall in love with a new artist as much as I want them to fall in love with ballet or dubstep or musical theater, and all of the other elements in the Red show they may not have seen before. Variety in entertainment can be so inspiring, and that&apos;s why I like to create different worlds with each song. It&apos;s why I like surprising the crowd with special guest performances they didn&apos;t expect. The fans have made my world a magical place to live in, and I guess this tour is me trying to do the same for them.
Does giving these acts a shot have any connection to the idea that a lot of acts, like Rascal Flatts, Kenny Chesney and Tim McGraw, gave you a chance early on?I&apos;ll never forget the people who gave me a chance to open up for them early on in my career. When I was a teenager, my biggest lessons came from Kenny Chesney, Tim McGraw, George Strait, Rascal Flatts and Brad Paisley. I learned so much from opening up for those artists, and it also taught me how to treat your opening acts and make them feel like they&apos;re part of a family, not just a tour. It&apos;s why we all hang out so much and go out to dinner and celebrate our achievements together. For me, it was the coolest feeling in the world when I realized Austin, Ed and I had all gotten nominated for VMAs. I&apos;m so proud of them.
How do you feel you have grown as a performer, especially in stadiums?I feel like you have to push yourself in order to become a better performer, and I never want a fan to leave the show saying, ""That was just like the last tour."" I like touring extensively because I think the more hours you spend onstage, the more you know who you are onstage. The more you throw yourself out of your comfort zone in the studio, the more colors you have to paint with when you go into the design stages of your tour. At the end of the day, the sound of a screaming crowd is my favorite sound, and the sight of a sold-out stadium is my favorite view. Everything derives from that and revolves around making those people dance, sing along, feel like they aren&apos;t alone, and ultimately want to come back and see me next time.
What are some of the weirder thoughts going through your head onstage during the show? Tonight I was particularly hung up on not chipping another tooth like last show in Pittsburgh, definitely. It had a tip on [the tooth] and it doesn&apos;t anymore. I try to be really quick with the microphone, so I&apos;m not standing there just waiting to sing with my mic right next to my face, so I really quickly pulled my mic up to sing and basically uppercut punched myself in the tooth. And then part of it fell onto the stage and I was like, ""Oh, I wonder how bad that was. I wonder which tooth that is and I wonder how bad that is,"" and I was just trying not to chip another one tonight. I&apos;m not doing anything about it. It&apos;s just gonna be a little bit jagged, I guess.
Sometimes I get really caught up in reading the signs, and if I get too caught up I will start to read the signs when I&apos;m singing, so I have to make sure I&apos;m only reading signs in musical breaks. [The signs] are all pretty out there most of the time, which I like. There will be people who just make a giant, huge picture of my cat&apos;s face, so big that it&apos;s all I can see, and that usually gets my attention. My cat out there, giant photocopy of her, eight foot by eight foot.
You&apos;re at home, basically.Right – ""this is so cozy!""
You walk through the crowd during ""Sparks Fly."" Is that scary, having thousands of people trying to get to you?No. You know, you get scratched a little bit, but that&apos;s nothing to be scared of. It&apos;s really cool to make eye contact with someone while you&apos;re singing. To be able to travel through the entire crowd and sort of surprise people who didn&apos;t think they were going to get up close to a performance – I think that&apos;s one of my favorite things about having a stage in different parts. It&apos;s kind of exhilarating actually, walking through a crazy, insane mob of people.
You posted some images from your Fourth of July party you had this summer. What are your other favorite offstage moments of the summer so far? I think the Fourth of July was way up there, just because anytime there&apos;s face-painting and frolicking involved, I&apos;m really excited about all of those things. I&apos;ve loved really being with my girlfriends a lot. Like, there have been a lot of kitchen dance parties with my girlfriends. The wonderful thing about playing a lot of stadiums is it&apos;s the equivalent to playing three or four arenas, so you have a few more days off. So I&apos;ve really enjoyed getting to have a summer and also have a really high-intensity job waiting for me.
So you&apos;ve been hanging out in Rhode Island a lot?I&apos;ve been in Rhode Island a lot. I&apos;ve been in L.A. a little bit. Man, Rhode Island&apos;s a good place. It&apos;s a really good place.
Are you reading or listening to anything at the moment that you&apos;re excited about?I&apos;m going back and revisiting Carly Simon a lot. I&apos;m listening to a lot of Carly Simon. And I have a copy of [F. Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s] Tender Is the Night that I&apos;m about to start reading, because I read it a long time ago and I want to reread it. I&apos;ve been reading a lot of different things, but I really like [Gillian Flynn&apos;s] Gone Girl and [Jess Walters&apos;] Beautiful Ruins. They&apos;re great stories. They kind of take you away.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203462.50/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324145706-20190324171706-00245.warc.gz

Seated near the front of the stage for the Backstreet Boys: Larger Than Life residency at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, Twain dressed all in black and wearing aviators, gamely took the hand of AJ McLean, who escorted her into the spotlight.

90,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/balsam-range-bluegrass-new-album-aeonic-775573/,"At last September’s International Bluegrass Music Association Awards, also known as the “Hillbilly Grammys,” the smart money was on Jerry Douglas’ Earls of Leicester to win the Entertainer of the Year grand prize. Formed to pay tribute to bluegrass forefathers Flatt & Scruggs, the Earls were reigning champions for the past three straight years. In a surprising upset, however, Entertainer honors instead went to Balsam Range, a workmanlike North Carolina quintet that has quietly built up a reputation over the past decade as one of the top acts in bluegrass. This was actually Balsam Range’s second time as Entertainer of the Year, after winning in 2014, but the fact that they topped the seemingly unstoppable Earls was remarkable.

Since forming in 2007 in Western North Carolina’s mountainous Haywood County, Balsam Range have released nine albums, including the new Aeonic. All five members have been around the block, repeatedly, with other bands, and they’re not especially flashy or cool. But Balsam Range crosses plenty of boundaries, hitting a deft balance between the revered traditions of old-school bluegrass and the hopped-up eclecticism of contemporary newgrass. Equal parts country-flavored bluegrass and 1970s-vintage progressive country, Balsam Range sound like a band that might have been playing Austin’s old Armadillo World Headquarters back in the day, opening for Michael Martin Murphey.

The new album’s title Aeonic is meant to convey longevity and carrying forward, and it hits notes ranging from sly (the she-done-left-me kickoff track “The Girl Who Invented the Wheel”) to tragic (“Angel Too Soon,” “Help Me to Hold On”) with the road-weary travelogue “The Rambler” somewhere in between. But Aeonic’s most immediately notable songs are a couple of wild-card covers. There’s Ray LaMontagne’s “Hobo Blues,” a Balsam Range soundcheck staple for years, in an arrangement along the lines of the Allman Brothers unplugged.

Even better is a double time version of the Beatles’ “If I Need Someone” with an appropriately symphonic feel thanks to fiddler Buddy Melton playing through an octave pedal to duplicate a larger string section. Balsam Range being a modest bunch, it’s fitting that their first recorded venture into Fab Four territory would be a song by the quiet Beatle, George Harrison.

“You never know what we’ll come up with,” says Melton. “Take any song and run it through Haywood County, and that’s what it sounds like no matter the genre.”

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxSeojT3xOg

While four different Balsam Range members sing lead on various songs, It’s Melton’s aching tenor that serves as the group’s vocal calling card, especially when he brings the pain. “Help Me to Hold On” sketches out a series of characters at the end of various ropes, struggling to get by. And the Paul Thorn-penned “Angel Too Soon” (which is about exactly what the title suggests) makes its bid as the saddest song in all of recorded history.

“The first time I heard that song, I could not get home fast enough,” says Melton. “I have a daughter who was fairly young, and it hit me really hard. Reminds you that things are not always permanent, so be grateful while you’ve got it. There’s another plan sometimes.”

Throughout, Aeonic is just old-timey enough and just modern enough to make bluegrass feel like it's still got plenty of life left.

“The best way to promote traditional bluegrass is to try and be original and do your own thing,” says mandolinist Darren Nicholson. “Some traditionalists almost killed it by always wanting to revert back to the old. But if all you’re doing is homage to the old and nobody’s doing anything new, then it dies. When Bill Monroe created bluegrass, he was cutting-edge and different. We’re trying to do the same thing. It’s hard to get too far away from the roots in bluegrass, but you have to put your own stamp on it.”

91,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/band-on-the-brink-documentary-spotlights-nashvilles-struggling-musicians-68696/?fb_action_ids=10205828309327389,"Nashville newspaper The Tennessean is shedding some light on the day-to-day struggles of working musicians in Music City, using a folk-rock band of professional songwriters, session players and producers — the New Dylans — as its source material. 

Back in the late-Eighties, the New Dylans were a band on the brink. BBC Radio One and MTV&apos;s 120 Minutes devoted a good chunk of airtime to the group&apos;s debut EP, which bandmates Jim Reilly and Reese Campbell had recorded with the rhythm section of 10,000 Maniacs. R.E.M.&apos;s Michael Stipe was a big fan, too. The band followed the EP&apos;s release with two full-length albums and several tours, including gigs with folk-rock heavyweights like the Band and Townes Van Zandt. The New Dylans were buzzworthy and critically adored, but buzz and ""best of"" lists didn&apos;t exactly pay their bills. Faced with the ever-present need to make a living, Reilly and Campbell called in quits in the mid-Nineties, just shy of their band&apos;s 10-year anniversary. 
Two decades later, the New Dylans are back. They&apos;ve got a new rhythm section — drummer Ken Coomer, an original member of Wilco who&apos;s since rebranded as a producer for artists like Will Hoge and Sons of Bill, and bass player Chris Autry, an A-list session player who often tours with Jo Dee Messina — as well as a new album. The buzz is the same, with The Tennessean devoting a 30-day blog series to the band&apos;s past, present and possible future. The story, though, is different, with Reilly and Campbell — as well as their lineup&apos;s new additions — now serving as poster boys for Nashville&apos;s class of hardscrabble musicians.  
For the past 16 years, Reilly has supported himself — with various levels of financial success — as a professional songwriter, writing tunes for everyone from Vince Gill to the cast of ABC&apos;s Nashville. On paper, it&apos;s a great gig. In reality, it&apos;s a pressure-packed job with little security and low pay rates, with Reilly hoping to renew his 12-month contract every calendar year. In a city filled with thousands of starry-eyed hopefuls with guitars in their hands and songs in their head, he&apos;s an example of someone who&apos;s ""made it"" as a professional songwriter. Still, with publishing companies tightening their budgets and record sales continuing to lag, Reilly is required to ""remake"" it on an annual basis. 
""As a creator, it&apos;s not the perfect environment for creation,"" he tells The Tennessean. ""It&apos;s Music City, but it&apos;s really Music Business City. There&apos;s not a lot of people who&apos;ve been doing it long who aren&apos;t really hollow and bitter, because that&apos;s kind of what it makes you.""
Later this month, the New Dylans will cap off their Tennessean coverage by screening a new documentary that chronicles their reunion — Band on the Brink: The New Dylans — at the Belcourt Theatre, Nashville&apos;s art house cinema. The band will play a short set after the showing, too, performing on the same stage that briefly housed the Grand Ole Opry during the 1930s. It&apos;s an enviable room to play, filled with nearly a century&apos;s worth of history and more than twice the capacity of Nashville venues like the 5 Spot and the High Watt. Still, for the New Dylans, it&apos;s just another step on the ladder.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202889.30/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323161556-20190323183556-00213.warc.gz

The band teamed up with producer Benny Cassette, known for his work with John Legend and Kanye West, for the song, which is currently available on streaming and digital download services.""Stay in the Dark"" isn&apos;t the band&apos;s first foray into pop, despite the band&apos;s denials of any interest in moving away from their country roots. Their 2015 single ""Live Forever"" was part of a scrapped pop album, Heart + Beat, that would have been released via Big Machine Label Group imprint Republic Nashville. After parting ways with Republic, the band released another new song, the pop-country anthem ""Comeback Kid,"" as their first official single with Interscope Records. That tune made a winking reference to their 2010 crossover smash ""If I Die Young,” later peaking just inside the top 40 of Billboard’s Country Airplay chart. As part of the rollout for the single, the Greeneville, Tennessee natives also rebooted their social media profiles with new photos showing a markedly drastic aesthetic departure from the bright neon colors of ""Live Forever"" and the muted neutrals of ""Comeback Kid.""

93,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/becoming-hank-how-tom-hiddleston-transformed-into-a-country-music-icon-201784/,"The light before a good sunset in Tennessee changes from fiery pink to a flood of gold until the sky eventually turns a dark enough purple to be lit by a falling star — just as Hank Williams wrote it. In September of 2014, the summer heat had eased up enough to enjoy the outdoors at dusk and those same colors began to fill the sky as Tom Hiddleston was finishing a run along the hillsides south of Nashville. In under 40 days, filming for the Hank Williams biopic I Saw the Light would begin in Shreveport, Louisiana, and the British-born actor had just arrived in Nashville to start the process of learning to sing, talk and look like the country music legend.

Becoming Hank Williams seems like a dubious fantasy as the tall, athletic Hiddleston sits down to talk after a run. His life is a far cry from Williams, who was plagued by poor health. Also, at 33, he&apos;s already four years older than the singer was at the time of his death. Still, he looks the perfect movie star age. . . which, of course, is no age at all.
Hiddleston, who won the Laurence Oliver Award for his mastery of Shakespeare, has been criticized for taking on the role of the Hillbilly Shakespeare — a moniker given to Williams in praise of his lyricism. A peer of Williams once described the singer&apos;s tendency for self-sabotage as him being unable to take one step forward without shooting himself in the foot, and as I find myself blankly staring at Hiddleston&apos;s running shoes, I conclude that he has a lot of work to do to become a mess.
""Sorry, I&apos;ve just run ten miles,"" the actor says methodically. It&apos;s daily chorus as he preps for the role, which required a significant weight loss to mirror Williams&apos; rail-thin frame. We sit in the recording studio as he divides his time between my questions and his sweet potatoes, using a folding chair as a makeshift dinner table. ""It&apos;s a regimen. To wake up in the morning and do six hours of singing and then run ten miles,"" he says, but not complaining. Rather, he&apos;s almost cheery while listing off his schedule. But no sooner than he could finish that list, the door swings open.
""I need &apos;Sir Lonesome a Lot&apos; in about ten minutes,"" says my father, Rodney Crowell, the music producer for I Saw the Light. Appointed anonyms are life-long and come as a lyrical lightning-bolts to my father, and though it was easy to see why the movie&apos;s lead actor had won the affection that begets a nickname, I struggled to understand why he had earned that particular one. I had been a wallflower for weeks, watching the men around me work on all things Hank, and observing Hiddleston was akin to crouching in the tundra, binocular-eyed, trying to study a creature who seemed to have no sense of the impossible.
My father baptized me in the sonic waters of Hank Williams, just as his father had done for him. I knew two things about the late icon as a child: the lonesome drawl in Williams&apos; voice and my father&apos;s reverence for the man. The gaps of Williams&apos; character were filled in by my childlike imagination and without knowing, that dark and ethereal honky-tonker had time-traveled with me into adulthood. I was a little embarrassed to find that my maturation could neither dissuade nor quell my desire for Williams to jump out of Hiddleston&apos;s body like a ghost I had been waiting my whole life to meet.
Hiddleston opted to live in my father&apos;s guest room instead of the apartment in downtown Nashville offered to him by the movie studio. And as a paternal story within a story, my father had been cast to play Hank&apos;s father, Lon, in the film. On the surface it seemed charming, but in reality this was their work and Hiddleston&apos;s need for a coach was pivotal.

""I had listened to &apos;Love Sick Blues&apos; and to &apos;Long Gone Lonesome Blues,&apos; and I didn&apos;t know how to make my vocal cords vibrate to make that specific sound,"" he admits. ""I thought it was an accident of genetics.""
Hiddleston describes being drawn to the script after reading it in 2012, feeling as if it were an exotic role and a far departure from anything he&apos;d done in his career. By the spring of 2014, while wrapping up the film Crimson Peak in Toronto, Hiddleston had reached a critical point in his learning of the narrowly precise vocal style of Williams. Marc Abraham, writer and director of I Saw the Light, arranged for the actor to meet his coach.
""Rodney flew to Toronto the day before Easter and we sat in this hotel room,"" Hiddleston recalls. ""We talked about the kind of extraordinary breadth of [Williams&apos;] life, how much joy he gave to people. We talked about his extraordinary, instinctive, innate lyricism and natural rhythm and charisma and also his very formidable demons and how those two things possibly come hand in hand. And then we talked about the music.""
Crowell took Hiddleston through an abridged history of the blues and mapped out the 1-4-5 chord progression that is the blueprint of classic country songs. ""It&apos;s probably the reason why &apos;Long Gone Lonesome Blues&apos; is one of my favorite Hank Williams songs,"" Hiddleston relates. ""When I listened to it as a fan it seemed so impossible, and Rodney sort of demystified it and took it off the mantle place and made it tangible.""
Hiddleston has distinct reverence for the songs he took off the ""mantle place"" and is meticulous as he speaks about them. But when he talks as a music lover, his shoulders soften and he&apos;s less careful with his words. ""There&apos;s an amazing renaissance essayist called Walter Pater who said, &apos;All art aspires to the condition of music.&apos; Music, without question, is my biggest inspiration. If I could only make people feel what I feel from this music then I&apos;ll have done something worthwhile.""
Acutely aware of how many Hank Williams fans he&apos;s working with, let alone those who will be watching the film, Hiddleston is a pro at preemptively quieting any chatter that he might not understand the gravity of his decision to take the role. ""I take my responsibility very seriously,"" he says. ""I know a lot of people in this country and in this town really care about Hank Williams. He&apos;s an inspiration and an icon for so many people, so I don&apos;t take that lightly.""

The first time I heard Hiddleston sing, his musical sensibility appeared intuitive. I had looked forward to asking him if he had written any of his own songs, but when I brought it up he skirted my question, answering, ""Probably."" For Hiddleston, stepping into Williams&apos; legacy meant demurring from any comparison, and he was carefully reticent not to allow his personal musicality to be significant. His vulnerability and integrity on the matter were indistinguishable, but what was clear was that if Hiddleston had ever fantasized about being a musician, it seemed prudent that he claimed only to play one. . . for now.
Deeply immersed in nearly every facet of Williams, there was one element that Hiddleston was decidedly unwilling to explore: the musician&apos;s propensity for self-destruction. ""I&apos;m sure there are many actors who would go more method and do it the Williams way, which is not eat and drink and smoke, but I just don&apos;t want to go there. I don&apos;t think it would do any good. You completely lose control over what you&apos;re doing.""
His decided process and conviction appeared synonymous, but Hiddleston would also have to answer to the technicality of shooting scenes out of sequence. Williams&apos; decline may have been successively linear, but Hiddleston would be tasked with time-jumping between acting as young-sober Hank to a young-drunk-and-dying Hank, sometimes in the same day.
""I had the great pleasure and privilege of working with Anthony Hopkins once,"" Hiddleston recalls. ""We once had a conversation and he said, &apos;Isn&apos;t it fascinating? People want their lives to be full of love and laughter, and they want to be happy but they need darkness. They want to listen to musicians sing about it; they want to see actors excavate it. The reason I know this is because all my life I&apos;ve played kings and princes, poets and paupers, beggars and butlers and all kinds of different parts, and when people stop me in the street they want to talk to me about one man. Who do you think that man is? Hannibal Lector.&apos;""
Hiddleston was delightful to watch, and I was beginning to wonder if anything was wrong with this man. He never seemed bored, he delighted at things that others barely noticed and he was able to simultaneously live in the moment while studying that same moment. But just as his expressions seemed to exist outside of the terrestrial realm, he too always felt a little out of reach.
One thing I noticed very early on was that Hiddleston had an enthusiasm for Luke the Drifter, an alias under which Williams recorded religious-themed songs and recitations. ""Luke the Drifter was a real revelation for me,"" he says, ""because it&apos;s like suddenly you have a window inside the man. It is something more personal.""
Laughing, Hiddleston then flips a switch, launching into an oration that sounds so much like Williams on his old recordings that it gives me chills. ""This song&apos;s been written by my half-brother, Luke the Drifter. You can get those records for 99 cents on EMM-GEE-EMM (MGM). I don&apos;t care if you buy &apos;em or not cause strictly I don&apos;t need the money no more. I don&apos;t know where they got the Luke part, but I sure do know where they got the drifting part.""
Before I can ask him to stay, Luke leaves the building. Hiddleston refocuses his eyes, continuing on in his native British accent. ""There&apos;s basically a massive overwhelming darkness in him that maybe is too dark for selling records at that time, and Luke the Drifter expresses that.""

Hiddleston leans on the side of academic when he talks about Williams, but when Luke is brought up he doesn&apos;t just speak about him, he invites him in. (I prayed the film wouldn&apos;t leave Luke on the cutting room floor, due to run-time constrictions.)
""We have Hank Williams, someone who is confused and charismatic and ambitious and tempted and floored,"" Hiddleston says, putting his hands on the back of his head as he thinks out loud. ""He&apos;s probably got a hole in his heart that he&apos;s trying to fill, which is why he is so desperate to get on the Opry and be a star. He gets to the Opry and realizes there is nothing there, and that&apos;s a tragedy in a way. It&apos;s like he is so desperate to be in the center of the limelight, and he gets to the center of the limelight and he realizes there is no center. By the time he realizes it, he is too drunk and high and lost — and that&apos;s something very real about the human condition. Even though I&apos;m sure he hurt a lot of people indirectly, I don&apos;t think he ever meant to. There are some people who just lose control and hurt people in the process. So I kind of love him, I love his irreverence, I love his wit.
""It&apos;s like there&apos;s a compulsion towards an exploration of darkness or people who have the courage to lean into it and make no apology or request to be liked,"" Hiddleston continues with a pause, and I wonder if he&apos;s talking about himself or Williams.
""Just in case I haven&apos;t said it, holy shit, big boots to fill,"" says the actor, as he preps to leave for the film&apos;s Louisiana set the next morning. It&apos;s now his last night in Nashville, and the house has an energy not unlike the last day of school: excited, accomplished and tipsy with kinship. Hiddleston is rarely unaware but for a moment as we sit alone in the studio, he appears to forget I&apos;m in the room. ""How&apos;d you do this, mother fucker? How did you do this?"" he asks a large, black and white portrait of Hank Williams, and I almost expected the portrait to speak back to him. ""Half the time I am so busy doing it that I don&apos;t stop to think about how or why I&apos;m doing it.""
The ""it"" is Williams. Hiddleston&apos;s intense study of the country star was now informing him instinctually. ""Who was it that said, &apos;Saturday damnation, Sunday redemption?&apos;"" The ""sinner and the saint"" was a fashionable theme in 1950&apos;s country music that encompassed the duality of Luke and Hank and more so encompassed the duality within Williams himself. Abandoning his English accent for the antiquated cadence of a bygone Grand Ole Opry star, Hiddleston orates a recitation: ""You have no right to be the judge, to criticize or condemn, just think before the grace of God it could be you instead of him."" Again, Luke was gone just as quickly as he&apos;d come.
""You&apos;re trying to express the common ground between you and the character, which is one of the most extraordinary side effects of having chosen to do this and commit to this as a life,"" the actor muses. ""You play all these different people and they all share attributes of yourself. So you realize that in some senses as the human race we are all the same, in so many respects. . . You study the specifics of someone, but you&apos;re also trying to access the part of you that has those things.""
Hiddleston transitions between characters as easily as he butters his bread, and as I try to keep track of which man is sitting across from me, I realize that I need not be in the room at all. The actor is asking, answering and exercising his own questions and curiosities.

As far back as I can remember, if I said something that reminded my father of a song, he would bypass my queries and break out singing whatever it was that my words had reminded him of. Off-duty musicians can be elusive, always staring blankly ahead while they thumb at a guitar or departing entirely from the planet to follow a lyric or melody that is running through their mind and down a rabbit hole. Actors, I&apos;ve learned, are not all that different — though instead of a melody they chase after moments in an attempt to expand them.
I still wasn&apos;t entirely sold on his nickname and as I had witnessed Hiddleston work, I couldn&apos;t shake the impression that he was more of a scholar of lonesomeness rather than he was a member of its club. When I asked my father why he called him ""Sir Lonesome a Lot,"" his answer was absolute as if I was asking why the sky is blue: ""Because that&apos;s who he is."" But this melancholic identity he had given to his friend had not yet revealed itself to me.
I had all but given up my search for Hiddleston&apos;s loner side when once again we had circle back to Luke in our conversation, speculating on what purpose Williams&apos; alter-ego served. ""I wish I could speak to him and ask him,"" he answers, and I&apos;m surprise by the genuine sadness to his voice. ""What would I ask Hank Williams if he were alive? I&apos;d ask him who his favorite musicians of the 20th century are. Rodney and I were talking about that last night. We were watching Howlin&apos; Wolf, and we were listening to the isolated vocals of Mercury and Bowie from &apos;Under Pressure.&apos; [Laughs] What would Hank think of all this? What would he make of Freddie Mercury? What would he make of the Rolling Stones? I&apos;d love to have seen who he&apos;d have turned into.""
As he continues to dream about conversing with Williams, I&apos;m reminded of my mother and her deep yearning to speak with her parents after they passed away and the impossible despair that came with knowing they could never again answer her questions. Hiddleston had grown to really care about Hank Williams as a person, if not a friend. Though he moved through moments of melancholy as if he were shaking the sand out of his boot, surely befriending a ghost was lonely?

Hiddleston is telling me what his next few weeks of shooting will be like when my father, again, throws open the door, this time his guitar resting high across his chest. He thumbs out one big chord on the guitar, which could only have been the start of a Williams song. Moving from the monotony of talking about music into actually hearing it was eye opening, and to my humor and frustration I notice how buoyantly happy my father is. His joy was as resolute as Hiddleston&apos;s. I laugh at my insistence for darkness when everyone around me is so light.
Hank Williams was my father&apos;s hero, something he had been honoring since he was a toddler, when he sat on top of his father&apos;s shoulders in a Texas dance hall, watching ole&apos; Hank live in concert. And now, as the high priest in the house of Hank, he has a new member of his congregation — Hiddleston, an adoring pupil with a hunger for knowledge. I suppose that I had been unknowingly exercising my due diligence by vetting Hiddleston, just as my sisters had been privately sizing him up without the excuse of an article or interview. I felt both dumb and proud by how ingrained our love for Williams was, as it had been handed down to us.
""Your daddy just hijacked this,"" Hiddleston says, giving me a sly smile. And we both join in singing, ""The news is out, all over town, that you&apos;ve been seen, running &apos;round. . . You win again.""
After the recorder is turned off and I&apos;m packing up to leave, Hiddleston stops me, seemingly knowing that I&apos;ve surrendered my stubborn pursuit of his dark side. He describes swimming in the ocean and being caught in murky seaweed but being able to see clear water out ahead. He explains that in the moments where he felt blind with frustration, blind with the task at hand, blind with Hank Williams. . . if he kept the clear water in view, he could keep going. It was his choice to make the darkness fleeting.

94,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/behind-the-scenes-at-austin-city-limits-40th-anniversary-show-248681/,"Austin&apos;s latest guitar great, Gary Clark Jr., didn&apos;t first learn about the blues from knocking around the club scene in his hometown. In fact, his introduction to the world beyond the pop radio dial came through television, when Austin City Limits aired a three-episode tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan.
The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time
As music legends and ACL vets like Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow and Jeff Bridges buzzed backstage at Thursday&apos;s 40th anniversary taping of the popular live music series, Clark talked about the impression those shows made on him as a developing musician. ""As a young guitar player I soaked that up because it was just different and new and it was from my home,"" he told Rolling Stone. ""I couldn&apos;t believe this was going on in my own town. After that Stevie show I would watch religiously because I had to know what was going on.""
Testimonials like this were easy to come by at an event that drew an all-star lineup of performers including Kris Kristofferson, Alabama Shakes, Jimmie Vaughan, Robert Earl Keen, Joe Ely, Doyle Bramhall II and Latin funk rockers Grupo Fantasma.
The four-hour show hosted by Crow and Bridges – and set to air on October 3rd as the kickoff to the series&apos; new season – featured plenty of the dream collaborations these kind of nights are built on. The wish list pairings kicked off with Raitt, Clark and Alabama Shakes&apos; Brittany Howard teaming up for the Fabulous Thunderbirds&apos; ""Wrap It Up"" and Crow and Kristofferson taking the stage for ""Me and Bobby McGee"" soon after.
Howard&apos;s simmering blues wail was a highlight throughout the night, both on her guest appearances and on a pair of her own band&apos;s songs, including the restrained and slow-building ""Gimme All Your Love.""
Raitt praised both the young singer and the aforementioned Clark, suggesting that the quality of talent in the room spoke to the influence the show has attained since debuting with a Willie Nelson performance in 1974. ""It feels like home to me,"" she said of her multiple ACL appearances, the first in 1981. ""It&apos;s perfect for roots musicians, and to see Brittany again and have two generations of blues and rhythm & blues artists – this is a perfect chance to just hang because these people are like family to me.""
Thanks to a house band of Austin musicians led by famed producer and steel guitar player Lloyd Maines, the show&apos;s Texas roots were apparent throughout the night, with Keen and Ely even teaming up near the end for a run through the Highwaymen&apos;s ""The Road Goes On Forever"" that saw the audience clapping and singing along loud enough to nearly overtake the performers.

Another surprise came when a video showed the Foo Fighters performing Roky Erickson&apos;s ""Two-Headed Dog"" in the original Austin City Limits studio earlier this year. The video will air as part of the 40th anniversary special broadcast, with lead singer Dave Grohl giving praise to ACL&apos;s legacy and telling the camera that being invited to tape an episode in 2008 was a career milestone for his band.
Crow shared a similar thought during a break backstage, recalling how her first taping, soon after the release of 1993&apos;s ""Tuesday Night Music Club,"" helped to validate her work. ""It was the biggest deal for me because it was a show for musicians,"" she said. ""It was where you got to see authentic singer-songwriters, authentic players and it was the mark of real musicianship. The show gave you the opportunity to see an artist stretch out and do something different from a recording and demonstrate they&apos;re able to play their stuff live and reinterpret it.""
The Grammy-winning singer returned to the stage for a final time when the entire cast closed the program with a raucous cover of the Buddy Holly rave-up ""Not Fade Away"" that saw nearly all of the 10 guitar players grab a solo turn. The closing number acted as an exclamation point on the night, one last affirmation of the show&apos;s prestige and ability to draw an all-star lineup of grateful musicians.
Bridges, himself a recording alum of the show, put ACL&apos;s legacy in perspective, sharing his own Stevie Ray memory. ""I mean, it beat out American Bandstand, what more can you say?"" Bridges said. ""I remember the first time I caught it Stevie Ray Vaughan was on and I thought it was cool that he got to get on TV and just play. I didn&apos;t know what it was when I saw it – I thought maybe it was one of those TV specials.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203865.15/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325092147-20190325114147-00509.warc.gz

It's an easy thing to overlook: with their 2018 album Tuscumbia, the Alabama foursome frequently nod to the Byrds and Big Star with bright, jangling guitars and shimmering vocal harmonies instead of the combination of swampy and earthy sounds one usually associates with the area.But the band, led by singer-songwriter Matt Green, laid the tracks for Tuscumbia – named for a town that neighbors Muscle Shoals – at Rick Hall's Fame Studios, the same place where iconic records by Aretha Franklin and Wilson Pickett were cut decades earlier. It was released via Single Lock records, the Florence, Alabama-based boutique imprint co-founded by songwriter John Paul White – with whom Belle Adair's members have supported as a backing band – and Alabama Shakes member Ben Tanner, who has toured with Belle Adair. Ranging from the gorgeous 12-string guitar work and sighing harmonies of ""Long Fade Out"" to the dreamy melancholy of album closer ""Rest Easy,"" the album radiates a feeling of serenity even as it wrestles with more disquieting matters.This week Belle Adair plays a pair of shows (including a Single Lock-sponsored event on March 14th) during South by Southwest, before taking a short break from the road. Rolling Stone Country spoke with leader Matthew Green on a phone call from Philadelphia (where he spends a big chunk of his time while his wife is in graduate school) and touched on Muscle Shoals history and feeling the band coalesce into something permanent.With the rise of Single Lock Records, it seems like musicians from the Muscle Shoals area are saying, ""Hey, we never stopped making great music here."" I was born in '82, so the Eighties to Nineties I don't really know what all was going on in town just because I was so young. But since the early 2000s, there's definitely been more stuff slowly percolating there and it is different in a lot of ways from what came before in the Fifties and Sixties and Seventies, but it's also in a lot of ways completely dependent upon that past success. The difference now is that it's more people or artists creating original music themselves, going out and touring, whereas before it was more about the studios and the session musicians and bringing artists in to make records. There was still tons of originality within what they were doing. They made amazing records, but they didn't really tour. Your sound doesn't have a lot of the country, soul or Americana hallmarks we usually associate with the Shoals. Where do you see Belle Adair fitting into that lineage? I definitely don't consider us to fall under that Americana-country umbrella. Our first record is a little bit folkier maybe. I think that's mostly a result of me writing those songs without a band on an acoustic guitar before I'd ever put the project together, you know, as a full band. I think that was a natural inclination that I had then in terms of songwriting. I feel like we fall more into some sort of a pop realm and not in terms of ""popular.""Do you think when Big Star was making power pop out of Memphis, that maybe they were defining that sound as part of the Memphis tradition as well?I think so. The thing about a band like Big Star is, they're Southern. You can hear that even though Alex Chilton sings with a fake British accent sometimes. You can hear the groove in a lot of that stuff, which to me is what probably defines it as ""Southern."" The British Invasion was built on all that stuff too. The underpinnings of what the music is, it's definitely guys who grew up in the South who were listening to music that was made in the South that was groove-oriented – a lot of it is. With our stuff, I hope that we can actually swing sometimes. There's so many bands that I love and listen to but they don't necessarily swing like that. So I hope that's something we can incorporate. We're definitely not trying to be not of the place we're from. We take the Shoals area, the history of it, very seriously in what we do. That's why we made the record at Fame, because we wanted to make it the way that they always made records there. That was a big deal to us.And you named it Tuscumbia, for crying out loud.That too. We're very much of a place and of a particular time in everything that's going on right now. There's other bands in town too that don't really fall under a really strict Americana umbrella. There's bands like the Pollies. They have some of that, but they're different. It's a little noisier rock stuff.With the previous album, you had written a lot of those songs on an acoustic guitar. How were things different with Tuscumbia?It was more having a stable lineup, a stable band ... and learning the strengths of the band from playing with them over time and thinking about how to incorporate more songs with vocal harmonies, because Adam the guitarist is a good vocal harmony singer. He also has a 12-string guitar, let's figure out ways to incorporate that into songs. Mostly with songwriting it's me alone in a room, but I think the difference between the first and the second record is that with the second one, there was more clarity about what the band was or was gonna be and how to write songs based on what we were. Whereas with the first record, there wasn't a band at all and there wasn't a thought of like, I'm gonna write these songs and put a band together and make a record.You originally recorded Tuscumbia three years ago. What took it so long to see the light of day?It was pretty much done in May of 2015. We even had that artwork pretty early on, too, not too long after that. It was a series of events that led to it being shelved for so long. Some of those reasons were personal to me. My wife is in grad school – she started in the fall of 2016 and she was in Rome, so I was overseas a lot and this all coincided with us starting to play with John [Paul White]. He put a record out in August of 2016, but we started touring with him before that, so we were pretty heavy and busy with him throughout 2016 and most of 2017 and my time off from that was mostly spent overseas for like a year. Now I'm doing the same thing in Philadelphia. There were a lot of personal issues, and also the professional things – starting to play with John, and I had toured with Dylan Leblanc some before that, so that took up a decent amount of my time. There were just a lot of moving parts and just trying to find the right opening to put out the record where we could actually devote our time to it, just took awhile to see where that hole was going to open up, and it finally did.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202506.45/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321072128-20190321094128-00333.warc.gz

Jimmie Allen & Abbey Anderson, ""Shallow""
A Star Is Born's show-stealing power ballad won big at this year's Oscars, taking home a trophy for Best Original Song. On this cover, country upstarts Jimmie Allen and Abby Anderson revamp the Lady Gaga/Bradley Cooper original with vocal acrobatics and country-pop polish, turning a tune about desperation into an even-keeled duet fit for prom slow dances.

Seth Walker, ""Inside""
Polyphonic and psychedelic, Seth Walker's ""Inside"" was inspired by a trip to Havana. The result is a funky, vintage-sounding exploration of rhythm and melody, with percussion-heavy production courtesy of the Wood Brothers' Jano Rix and an out-of-the-box arrangement that's unafraid to visit — and ultimately travel beyond — the stoned swagger of Dr. John's Desitively Bonnaroo.

Patrick Park, ""Everything Falls Apart""
An Elliot Smith-worthy folksong about ""being kind in the face of defeat and disgrace,"" ""Everything Falls Apart"" mixes melody and melancholy in equal amounts. A string arrangement helps boost Park's acoustic guitar, but the real treat here is the song's message of self-reliance and personal worth.

Conor Donohue, ""The Garden""
The first half of ""The Garden"" is bare-boned and ballad-like, with Conor Donohue singing about his mental struggles over a gentle acoustic guitar. Then, right around the song's midpoint, ""The Garden"" bursts into bloom with cymbal crashes, keyboards and female harmonies. It's a pastoral folksong with a garage-Americana heart.

Jennifer Nettles, ""I Can Do Hard Things""
Rooted in the Sunday-morning uplift of gospel music and the full-throated belt of blues, ""I Can Do Hard Things"" finds Jennifer Nettles singing about the challenges and triumphs of adulthood. She's tired of compartmentalizing the world into categories of ""black and white"" or ""wrong and night."" Instead, ""I Can Do Hard Things"" celebrates the in-betweens. As always, Nettles sells the song with a super-sized voice rich in Southern twang and Broadway-stage vibrato.

Bailen, ""I Was Wrong""
""Nothing’s gonna change ‘til we all can say, 'I believe that I was wrong,'"" goes the refrain to this democratic song about reaching across the aisle, admitting fault and moving forward. Performed by a family band of young, New York-based coeds and produced by indie-rock titan John Congleton, ""I Was Wrong"" mixes a cynical if cathartic chorus with triple-stacked sibling harmonies.

Ingrid Andress, ""Lady Like""
Don't tell Ingrid Andress how to act. She outlines her own version of womanhood with this slow-burning anthem of independence, which celebrates a woman's right to be outspoken and self-governed. ""Don't bite my tongue, I speak my mind/Let curse words fly when shit goes wrong,"" she sings in a sturdy voice that owes more to pop music — a genre that's already welcomed Andress into its fold, following her songwriting collaborations with artists like Charli XCX and Alicia Keys — than the country genre.

A faceless collective of Nashville-area musicians and producers, neonPPL aims to spread a message of inclusivity through positive-minded songs like ""beYOUtiful."" The lightly danceable pop anthem features vocals from Lindsay Ell, Danielle Bradbery and Joy Williams, but ""beYOUtiful"" urges its audience to focus on the content, not the cast. ""You're the only one who can be you, so do 'you' as best you can,"" the women sing, while a piano twinkles and an electronic drumbeat keeps time in the background.

Tucker Beathard, ""Better Than Me""
Now signed to Warner Music Nashville, Beathard kicks off a new album cycle with this rock-influenced breakup song. ""Better Than Me"" finds the young songwriter rooted in place, unable to move past the remains of a relationship that's long since crumbled. The chorus is kinetic, arena-country gold, with a melody that swings for the fences and a reverb-heavy ambiance that tips its unbent ballcap brim to Kip Moore.

Bob Lewis, ""All My Sins""
With guests ranging from Aaron Lee Tasjan to Jamie Kent, songwriter Bob Lewis's new album End of an Error feels like a lo-fi love letter postmarked from somewhere deep within the East Nashville Americana underground. He gets pensive with the acoustic ""All My Sins,"" where he traces his wanderlust back to a Pennsylvania childhood spent ""bored to death in a living room."" Woozy, warm and unapologetically weird.

Crowder, ""Wildfire""

Jerrod Niemann, ""Old Glory""
Inspired by last year's ambush of American soldiers in Niger, ""Old Glory"" pays patriotic tribute to the armed services. ""I fight for you so that you're free / We've never met, but bet I'll do it again,"" goes the chorus, delivered from the perspective of a deployed peacekeeper. Rooted in a laidback groove that owes more to Jack Johnson than Lee Greenwood, ""Old Glory"" updates country music's flag-waving tradition with summery swagger.

Once hailed as rockabilly's Gen-X queen, Lenz expands her retro roots with the title track from her Follow Me follow-up. Here, she delivers a smoldering torch song that's built as much for the lounge as the juke joint, selling each line like the love child of Wanda Jackson and Chris Isaak.

A longtime opening act for the Violent Femmes, Brett Newski offers his own version of minimalist, left-field folk-pop — a sound crystallized by his tour mates during their Eighties heyday — on this sunny title track. There's some serious desperation here (""Somebody talk to me, tonight especially,"" Newski pleads in the first verse), but keyboards and campfire-worthy acoustic guitars help balance the mood, turning ""Life Upside Down"" into a heartwarming ode to heartbreak.

Tim Higgins, ""Blight""
Singer-songwriter Tim Higgins is familiar with blight. Raised amidst the urban decay of Detroit, he delivers this slow-burning ballad with a deep, rumbling baritone, evoking his hometown's dark, doomed beauty along the way.

Craig Brown Band, ""Big City, Small Town""
Released by Jack White's Third Man Records, ""Big City, Small Town"" barrels forward at slaphappy speed, merging the sounds of classic country — a pedal steel riff there, a wave of harmonized female vocals there — with punky spirit and a reminder to mind your words.

The Revivalists, ""All My Friends""
The Revivalists are revived, thanks to an expanded lineup and a newly-released LP. ""All my friends take good care of me,"" goes the hook to Take Good Care's kickoff single, which swings extra hard for the fences in this live performance captured at Colorado's famous Red Rocks.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202125.41/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319183735-20190319205735-00126.warc.gz

Meat Puppets, ""Warranty""
With drummer Derrick Bostrom back behind the kit after a 22-year absence, Meat Puppets are reunited and revitalized, their problems transformed into backwater under the bridge. ""Warranty"" is the kickoff single from their newest album, Dusty Notes, and it returns the band to familiar territory — a sound rooted in college-rock jangle, cosmic alt-country and campfire singalongs.

Reba McEntire, ""Tammy Wynette Kind of Pain""
One country legend salutes another on this Brandy Clark co-write, whose lyrics namecheck songs like ""Crying in the Rain"" and ""Stand By Your Man."" Reba McEntire sings ""Tammy Wynette Kind of Pain"" as though it's already become a staple of honky-tonk karaoke nights, ripping into the song's key change with all the dramatic, sad-eyed gusto of ""D-I-V-O-R-C-E.""

Hayes Carll, ""Times Like These""
Hayes Carll keeps the dancehall moving with ""Times Like These,"" a Texas two-stepper whose upbeat arrangement can't quite disguise the song's dark, desperate lyrics. ""I'm a'losing my mind in times like these,"" he admits in his half-sung, half-slurred voice, while a fiddle saws in the background.

Maren Morris featuring Brothers Osborne, ""All My Favorite People""
On an album filled with R&B highlights and modern pop gems, ""All My Favorite People"" reminds listeners of Maren Morris' country background. She trades verses with TJ Osborne, who just might be modern country's finest baritone, before yielding the stage altogether to brother John, whose electric guitar steals the show during the song's final moments.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwIzfHAsPRM

Twinnie, ""Better When I'm Drunk""
U.K. artist Twinnie measures the distance between a fun-filled, liquored-up evening and the all-too-sober morning that follows. With a bright, bouncing arrangement that's more rooted in the slaphappy swagger of a bender than the slow-moving melancholia of a hangover, ""Better When I'm Drunk"" celebrates the bad decisions that accompany a night of heavy drinking.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD7t8lUa7tI

Bailey Bryan, ""Perspective""
Bailey Bryan's got a new crush and a fresh outlook on life. ""[I'm] seeing my reflection from a better point of view,"" she sings over hip-hop drums and sparse keyboards. Is she singing to her beau? Her audience? Herself? ""Perspective"" doesn't offer any real answers, doubling down instead on pop hooks and a percussive pulse.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcs4ubonyLk

Shawn James, ""Orpheus""
Greek icons meet Southern soul on Shawn James' newest track, whose blue notes, bass grooves and brass tell the ancient story of Orpheus' attempt to restore his wife's life. A folksinger who played sad songs on the lyre, Orpheus' own music wouldn't have sounded anything like this loud, lushly-produced banger. Still, it's fun to hear Shawn James rewrite mythology.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NT4uKYjmj4

Justin Moore, ""Jesus and Jack Daniels""
This sneak preview from Justin Moore's Late Nights and Longnecks mixes dyed-in-the-denim traditionalism with just enough modern-day sheen. The storyline may sound familiar — there's a devout mother, a drunk husband and a son who grows up to mirror his parents' hobbies, pounding a beer one minute and a Bible the next — but ""Jesus and Jack Daniels"" places most of its focus on the warm rumble of Moore's voice, which sounds as smooth as the titular whiskey.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2I_I0txGUI

Vandoliers, ""Sixteen Years""
Filled with mariachi horns, distorted guitars and the barroom bray of frontman Joshua Fleming, ""Sixteen Years"" plants its rebel flag somewhere between Red Dirt country and punky, ragged roots-rock. It's an anthem of dedication and driven determination, sung by a lifer who refuses to hang up his Telecaster. ""I'm gonna make it if it takes another sixteen years,"" he sings defiantly, right before the horn section blasts its approval.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WxeOu6v6F8

Tami Neilson, ""Big Boss Mama""
Once you step into Tami Neilson's office, you better be ready to follow the CEO's orders. ""I'm calling all the shots!"" she announces, delivering each word with the super-sized soul and swaggering sass of Sharon Jones. Shot through with bright, biting bursts of rockabilly guitar, ""Big Boss Mama"" is everything its title promises — a larger-than-life celebration of the women who run the world.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202506.45/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321072128-20190321094128-00395.warc.gz

William Matheny, ""Christian Name""
Alt-country guitars meet power-pop melodies on the newest release from this West Virginia troubadour, who logged years as a sideman before going solo with last year's Constellations. Having already released a follow-up album this past April, he continues the prolific streak with ""Christian Name,"" a warm 'n' weary road that doubles as the B-side to Matheny's cover of the Centro-matic song ""Flashes And Cables.""

https://youtu.be/ZSdOJctKgXE

Jamey Johnson, Chris Stapleton, Willie Nelson and Lee Ann Womack, ""Gotta Serve Somebody""
Multiple generations of country icons team up for this swampy cover of Bob Dylan's Grammy-winning original. There's no clear leader; instead, all four vocalists share the spotlight equally, swapping holy-roller gospel riffs like members of the Bible Belt's coolest church choir. Behind them, Mickey Raphael wails on harmonica while Jim ""Moose"" Brown (a former member of Bob Seger's Silver Bullet Band) chimes in with electric guitar.

https://youtu.be/YuPzpoC3QNc

The Chainsmokers featuring Kelsea Ballerini, ""This Feeling""
The EDM duo and the country chart-topper meet each other halfway on this crossover single, which shines equal light on both sides of the country-pop divide. Glittering with electronics and vocal effects, ""This Feeling"" finds its two vocalists struggling to define the feeling that's making their hearts flutter. By the time the chorus arrives, though, they've abandoned the search for the right word, resorting instead to a ""Yeah yeah yeah"" refrain that's built for mass singalongs.

https://soundcloud.com/benbarnaby/donna-the-buffalo-dance-in-the-street-02-motor?in=benbarnaby/sets/dance-in-the-street/s-oAB0c

Donna the Buffalo, ""Dance in the Street""
Donna the Buffalo double down on socially-conscious songs about unity and self-improvement with the upcoming Dance in the Street, their first album in half a decade. ""Motor,"" the record's second track, is every bit as kinetic as its title indicates, with co-founder Tara Nevins encouraging her listeners to abandon their emotional baggage and speed toward a brighter horizon. ""You'll be dancing under the moon before too long,"" she promises, while sunny guitars kick up clouds of highway dust in the background.

https://youtu.be/E7DKsEIgwNc

Kate Campbell, ""Damn Sure Blue""
The title track from her newest collection finds Campbell in a dispirited mood, weighed down by the weight of a modern world. ""I can't see why good people do such hateful things, but they damn sure do,"" she sings during the chorus, whose bright bounce stands in contrast to its sad-eyed message. Like Hank Williams Sr., Campbell doesn't let sorrowful subject matter get in the way of a good country song, which lends a classic bent to an otherwise contemporary song.

https://youtu.be/b1xOhGhE1FI

Walker McGuire, ""Growin' Up""
The modern drum loops and polished, poppy production may look beyond country music's traditional boundaries, but ""Growin' Up"" still delivers a time-tested message that's all too familiar to the genre's die-hards: the coming-of-age realization that you can never go back home again. By the song's end, bandmates Jordan Walker and Johnny McGuire have stopped wishing they could travel back in time, choosing instead to salute the memory of a bygone adolescence. ""Let's raise 'em up and make a toast to forever,"" they sing, before launching into one last stadium-sized refrain.

https://youtu.be/1LIkOCmCSWA

Marissa Nadler, ""Said Goodbye to That Car""
Not all machines are built to last. On ""Said Goodbye to That Car,"" Nadler turns the breakdown of her car into a metaphor for a dying relationship. ""119,657 and the engine blew, 119,657 and I thought of you,"" she croons, fashioning a chorus out of the vehicle's final odometer reading. Far more stark and stripped-down than the songs from 2016's Strangers, ""Said Goodbye to That Car"" refocuses attention on Nadler's voice, an otherworldly instrument that's capable of wringing emotion out of references to a dashboard.

https://youtu.be/aqMLLdbkM_4

Kane Brown, ""Short Skirt Weather""
After landing a line of crossover hits with his modern, R&B-influenced sound, Brown renews his country credentials with ""Short Skirt Weather,"" a sunny single worthy of country-pop's 1990s golden years. The fiddle player, electric guitarist and upright pianist all rip their own solos, while Brown delivers his chorus with a wink and a rumbling, deep-seated baritone. One of the genre's most popular Millennials, Kane Brown may be proof that the kids are, indeed, alright.

https://soundcloud.com/mattcampbelltroubadour/the-night-that-i-found-jesus

Matt Campbell, ""The Night That I Found Jesus""
""Gather 'round, there, y'all people, for the story I will tell,"" Matt Campbell begins, kicking off this country-fried combination of twang, Telecasters and train beats like some old-world folk hero. A former bar back at Robert's Western World in downtown Nashville, Campbell has since graduated to playing gigs upon the venue's iconic stage. ""The Night I Found Jesus"" doubles down on that experience, mixing Campbell's tall-tale delivery with vintage songwriting built for dancehalls and honky-tonks.

Solo artists Jill Andrews and Peter Groenwald join forces on this tribute to new beginnings, renewed love and the optimistic rush of each new day.

Daddy Long Legs, ""Glad Rag Ball""
Dropping the fuzz and amplification for this acoustic blues-jam-in-a-park, New York trio Daddy Long Legs showcase the live vibe of the band's upcoming Lowdown Ways LP (out May 10th).

Hailey Whitters, ""Ten Year Town""
Ten years may feel like an eternity in Music City, and those 15 minutes of fame (or hopefully longer) may never come your way, now matter how long you try. Hailey Whitters makes the musicians' struggle sound delicate and beautiful on ""Ten Year Town,"" a gentle ballad co-written with Brandy Clark about sticking it out no matter your quote-unquote sell-by date.

Steve Poltz, ""Ballin' on a Wednesday""
Wednesday schmensday, Canadian songwriter Steve Poltz sees no reason to get the midweek blues on this scuzzy new cut from Shine On. Plenty bluesy all the same, Poltz doesn't need you to read between the lines to get the gist of this ode to Hump Day.

Sarah Potenza, ""Diamond""
""They can't fuck with girls like me,"" sings Sarah Potenza on this full-throated slow-burner from her Road to Rome LP, due out this week. No rough edges on this ""Diamond,"" either, just a loud and proud exultation from the onetime  Voice contestant.

Emily Duff, ""Hallelujah Hello""
Praise be to the rock & roll survivors, and on ""Hallelujah Hello"" New York vet Emily Duff gives her own thanks with some meaty slide guitar and stained-glass organ. One part Patti Smith, one part Muscle Shoals, it's the title track to her new, just-released LP.

Tenille Townes, ""White Horse""
White horses or wild flowers, Tenille Townes is through with marrying herself to a fantasy on this cut from last year's Living Room Worktapes EP. Romance isn't dead, but it's not a fairytale either, and no knight in shining armor will change that.

Jack Ingram, ""Where There's a Willie""
Where there's a will, there's a way to write another song about Willie Nelson, especially if you're from Texas. This boozy, eight-minute ode from Jack Ingram gets in a nod to Waylon, too, and will appear on his Riding High…Again come April.

Chris Shiflett, ""This Ol' World""
When Chris Shiflett isn't busy with Foo Fighters or recording podcasts, he's lighting up some California country rock, and on ""This Ol' World"" he fully brings the guitar-slinging pyrotechnics. A lick, a verse and a couple mean solos are all Shiflett needs to make a statement.

Muscadine Bloodline, ""Montgomery""
Heartbreak might be a hell of a lot easier if there weren't so many reminders to deal with, and Muscadine Bloodline have a big one on their hands: the entire city of Montgomery. Short of taking a detour, their best bet at catharsis is to turn their angst into a song.

Fairground Saints, ""Somewhere Down the Line""
Set to a kick-drummed pulse, ""Somewhere Down the Line"" marries the coed Californian harmonies of Fleetwood Mac with the polished punch of modern country-pop. ""I've got a full tank of gas and some money,"" goes the chorus, stacked high with layered vocals, banjo and pedal steel. File this single under ""road trip soundtrack.""

Stephen Kellogg, ""Love of My Life""
""This is a simple song about simple things: a boy and a girl and a wedding ring,"" Stephen Kellogg sings in ""Love of My Life,"" while atmospheric guitars ebb and flow in the background. Originally written as a birthday present for his wife, the song doubles as the kickoff single from next month's Objects in the Mirror, which finds Kellog working with fellow roots-rock road warrior Will Hoge.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLP3-6C_Egw

Delta Rae, ""Hands Dirty""
The #MeToo movement gets another well-deserved anthem courtesy of Delta Rae, whose Brittany Holljes sings ""Hands Dirty"" with a mix of electrifying empowerment and pissed-off soul. ""They show me no mercy, so I just keep on working,"" she sings over a groove of stomped feet and clapped hands. Uncompromising and utterly compelling, ""Hands Dirty"" makes its well-timed arrival during election season.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cphr5v7F_3g

Whitey Morgan and the 78s, ""Just Got Paid""
Nearly 50 years after ZZ Top's Rio Grande Mud, this deep cut gets a dark n' dirty makeover courtesy of another big-bearded, country-rock outlaw. Morgan's version is similarly gruff and guitar-heavy, with clear reverence for the original. To bring everything full circle, he recorded ""Just Got Paid"" at Sonic Ranch Studios in Tornillo, Texas, less than a day's drive from ZZ Top's old stomping grounds of Houston.

Brandi Carlile & Sam Smith, ""Party of One""
Brandi Carlile revisits the final song from By the Way, I Forgive You, this time sharing the song's elastic melody with Sam Smith. Also returning to the fold is producer Dave Cobb, who decorates the track with subtly grand touches — a burst of upright piano here, an orchestral crescendo there — and wisely waits until the four-minute mark to bring in the rest of the band. After all, when two voices as powerful as these are leading the charge, do you really need the rest of the troops?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExZw60U8X4

Dillon Carmichael, ""Dancing Away With My Heart""
At 24 years old, Dillon Carmichael sings with a big-voiced baritone that belies his Millennial status. Here, he delivers a power ballad like the second coming of Randy Travis, reaching into his lowest register for rumbling proclamations of love and loyalty. He gets clever in the chorus, too, reshuffling the standard wedding-vow script for a memorable hook — ""Nobody's ever gonna love you the way I do, 'til death do us part"" — that's both familiar and out-of-the-box.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87aBbbh_Ikw

The Bad Signs, ""Dial 666""
Released just in time for Halloween, this garage-rock ghost story finds frontwoman Samantha Harlow dialing up the devil with a favor in mind. Her baby is gone — like, mortally gone — and she's looking to get him back at any cost. In the background, a tremolo-heavy guitar drowns in a pool of reverb, as though the Bad Signs recorded ""Dial 666"" in a spooky, Upside Down version of Sun Studio.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkDUVGyngVQ

Henry Jamison, ""Gloria""
Folksinger Henry Jamison examines the way in which skewed, violent interpretations of masculinity are passed down from generation to generation. In one verse, a group of strangers yell homophobic slurs at two boys as they pass by Dairy Queen. In another, a bloody video game desensitizes those same boys to carnage. The lyrical content may be heavy, but the song's arrangement is dreamy and downy soft, laced with orchestral strings and a Sufjan Stevens-worthy vocal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6kHnUXHOo0

Leyla McCalla, ""The Capitalist Blues""
Inspired by Leyla McCalla's adopted hometown of New Orleans, ""The Capitalist Blues"" finds the former Carolina Chocolate Drop mixing Big Easy brass with protest-song sentiment. The song lurches forward with greasy, half-lit swagger, like a Mardi Gras band at the end of a lively, drunken parade. Look deeper, though, and McCalla's politically pointed lyrics pack a stronger punch than a Sazerac.

The Mavericks, ""Hey! Merry Christmas!""
The title track to the Mavericks' new Christmas record nods to the old-school holiday music that whipped up Christmas cheer during the mid-20th century.

Bebe Rexha and Florida Georgia Line ruled for 50 weeks straight with ""Meant to Be,"" while Maren Morris lent her soulful pipes to Zedd and Grey's ebullient dance track ""The Middle,"" now nominated for a Record of the Year Grammy. Additionally, 2018 saw winning collaborations in the country mainstream, like Dierks Bentley and Brothers Osborne's ""Burning Man,"" as well as in Americana, with Robbie Fulks and Linda Gail Lewis' ""Wild!

Asleep at the Wheel with Scott and Seth Avett, ""Willie Got There First""
""I had such a great idea for a song,"" Seth Avett laments on his and brother Scott's tune with Asleep at the Wheel, ""Willie Got There First."" If only it hadn't been for Willie Nelson. Tributes to the Red Headed Stranger are more prolific than the strains of Willie's Reserve, but few capture the essence of his music quit like this one, by turns brittle, breezy and wistful. It gets a boost of credibility via guest spots from Bobbie Nelson, Mickey Raphael and a verse from Nelson's buddy of more than 40 years, Ray Benson.
https://youtu.be/zDo0H8Fm7d0

Bebe Rexha featuring Florida Georgia Line, ""Meant to Be""
When it comes to cutting a hit record, you just can't force things. In the case of ""Meant to Be"" (which was actually released in 2017 but ruled this entire year), the sheer unlikeliness of the pairing — pop-star-on-the-rise Bebe Rexha and bro-country kingpins Florida Georgia Line — may have been the key to its record-setting success. Make that record-smashing: ""Meant to Be"" spent an unprecedented 50 weeks atop the Hot Country Songs chart, and it did so by playing to both artists' strengths, more attitude than style without any egos getting in the way. C'est la vie, say the young folks.

https://youtu.be/2hp7Lotbmgs

Dierks Bentley featuring Brothers Osborne, ""Burning Man""
If adulthood sometimes feels a little bit like barely keeping things together, then Dierks Bentley gets by with a little help from his friends on ""Burning Man."" The biggest, toughest cut from Bentley's The Mountain LP, the oblong nod to Nevada's Burning Man Festival gets its grizzled, world-wearied edge from Brothers Osborne, and in particular the scorching guitar work of John Osborne, who squeezes not one but two solos into less than four minutes. A little bit steady, a little bit rolling stone, but above all just plain rocking.

https://youtu.be/KOlrH6d7F58

David Lee Murphy and Kenny Chesney, ""Everything's Gonna Be Alright""
Fourteen years is a long time to go between albums. Longer still is 23 years between Number One singles. But David Lee Murphy, a Nineties leading man and hitmaker for troves of other country stars since, not only made a comeback with No Zip Code in 2018, he also topped the charts with old buddy and fellow zen spirit Kenny Chesney on ""Everything's Gonna Be Alright."" A breezy, life-is-good mantra that sees these two vets trading verses and singing harmonies, it fits right in with the beach-bumming gratitude of the No Shoes Nation.

https://youtu.be/l25AL0BdD6w

Sugarland featuring Taylor Swift, ""Babe""
Taylor Swift's return to the country arena was bound to come with a media blitz, and ""Babe"" didn't disappoint, with a Mad Men-themed music video starring her, Brandon Routh and Sugarland's Jennifer Nettles. OK, so it wasn't the chart-topping smash that might've been expected, but Swift's home-wrecking turn in the video is a perfectly meta jab at her own reputation, and the song itself has her lipstick traces all over it. Yet Sugarland make ""Babe"" their own, with Nettles exuding the necessary backbone to cut herself free from a broken heart.

https://youtu.be/M3mJkSqZbX4

Zedd, Maren Morris, Grey, ""The Middle""
Country crossovers with EDM may not be calculated to appease the purists, but if Maren Morris's collaborations — from Thomas Rhett to Vince Gill — have proven anything it's that she can sing, well, anything. With a voice that's equal parts soul and twang, her modulations make Auto-Tune sound natural, and she's a perfect fit for the sugary maximalism of ""The Middle."" Yet for all its poppy, club-going charm, this cut with Zedd and Grey — which is up for Record of the Year at the 2019 Grammys — thrives on a simple less-is-more adherence to the beat.

Jason Aldean featuring Miranda Lambert, ""Drowns the Whiskey""
The last time Jason Aldean and Miranda Lambert hit the studio together was for 2007's ""Grown Woman."" More than 10 years later, they reunite for ""Drowns the Whiskey."" On one level, the slow-burning ballad is a raise of the glass to the Lynchburg, Tennessee-based Jack Daniel's distillery; but just below the surface, there's a palpable sense of heartbreak, likely fueled in part by the turmoil and tragedy that have colored both artists' lives over the past decade. The type of emotion in their vocal delivery can only come from first-hand experience.
https://youtu.be/357OEcFQPFA
Sam Morrow and Jaime Wyatt, ""Skinny Elvis""
Suspicious minds couldn't hope to keep step with the do-si-doing boogie of ""Skinny Elvis,"" which features California outlaws Sam Morrow and Jaime Wyatt careening joyously toward the cliff edge like a 2018 Thelma and Louise. This pair knows a thing or two about living dangerously, but they keep things lean and mean here, their vocals locked in line-for-line while pedal steel great Jay Dee Maness peels off riffs that hearken to the King's karate-chopping Vegas best. While he was still skinny, of course.

Ruston Kelly and Kacey Musgraves, ""To June This Morning""
Like any good love story, there was a touch of serendipity in ""To June This Morning"" landing on Forever Words, the collection of Johnny Cash writings put to music at the direction of his son, John Carter Cash. A poem that Cash wrote for June Carter Cash in 1970, it was only brought to his son's attention by Ruston Kelly, but it's Kelly's performance — and chemistry — with his own wife Kacey Musgraves that brings these words so charmingly to life. Two minutes of hope and devotion, it's time enough to break a heart or to fall in love.

Robbie Fulks and Linda Gail Lewis, ""Wild Wild Wild""
We may never know what Darwin would say about rock & roll, but there's no question how Robbie Fulks and Linda Gail Lewis feel about evolution. On their rip-roaring rockabilly throwback ""Wild Wild Wild,"" they declare that ""the animals are running the zoo"" in gleeful, full-throated unison. Every note of this song, from Lewis pounding on the ivory to Fulks shredding his guitar, is a celebration of rock's healing, hedonistic powers, and above all to the genre's rabble-rousing power to piss off old people.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201672.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20190318191656-20190318213656-00450.warc.gz

Others still lampooned the very art of making videos. Here's the 10 must-watch clips of the year.

John Prine, ""Summer's End""
A woman loses her life to opioids, leaving behind a young daughter and an elderly father. The aftermath is shown in a series of quick vignettes: an emotional breakdown at school; a trip to a fruit orchard; a family visitation at the gravesite. Directed by Kerrin Sheldon and Elaine McMillion Sheldon, the ""Summer's End"" video is dedicated to Max Barry, son of former Nashville mayor Megan Barry, who lost his own battle to addiction in 2017.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YeQj22Vw0M

Brandi Carlile, ""Hold Out Your Hand""
Brandi Carlile joins the youth movement, raising her fist (and her voice) in this politically pointed video. Shot during the Seattle March for Our Lives, the clip alternates between live footage of Carlile's band and clips of peaceful protestors marching against gun violence. The result is a video that focuses not only on the frontwoman herself, but on a city of young activists eager for an opportunity to better their tomorrow.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbNDJRwXKGc

Kacey Musgraves, ""High Horse""
Director Hannah Lux Davis fills this lavishly retro video with all the wood paneling, oversized collars and tangerine-colored pantsuits of the disco era, turning ""High Horse"" into a 9 to 5-worthy clip that skewers any cocksure character who's grown too big for his bellbottoms. In this case, that character is Kacey Musgraves' boss, who leers lecherously at his female staff and, somewhere around the first chorus, inspires Musgraves to daydream an escape from the workplace. She brings her co-workers along for the ride, and the result is a Seventies send-up that glitters in all the right places.

Pistol Annies, ""Got My Name Changed Back""
Party in the courtroom! Miranda Lambert has booked a one-way ticket to Splitsville, and she's bringing Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley along for the ride. A tongue-in-cheek celebration of the legal headaches that follow a divorce, ""Got My Name Changed Back"" features a sympathetic judge, a baby-bump-sporting Presley and, if Lambert's sparkling smile is to be believed, the world's first positive experience at a DMV.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAAVj6nnIUs&amp;amp;t=69s

Brothers Osborne, ""Shoot Me Straight""
Evoking Weekend at Bernie's, this video-within-a-video involves dart guns, Dierks Bentley and a pair of passed-out Osbornes, their limbs rubbery as they're manipulated into a variety of rock-star postures. The climactic guitar-solo scene steals the show, with the clip's own director donning a wig and a fake beard in order to portray six-string slinger John Osborne.

Kip Moore, ""Last Shot""
A doctor delivers heartbreaking news to a pack of friends who've been together since childhood. While one of them fights for her life in a hospital room, the others hatch a plan to break her free — one last time — and fulfill a lifelong dream to see Paris. Directed by PJ Brown, ""Last Shot"" is cinematic and heart-rending.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE-PiUdtttQ

Brandon Stansell, ""Hometown""
A proudly gay artist in a relatively buttoned-up genre, Brandon Stansell begins this emotionally-charged video with a (slightly) fictionalized version of his own coming-out exchange with his blindsided mother. She pushes him out of the house, kickstarting a painful — but ultimately strengthening — period of self-discovery.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4qgqNS_20s

Dan + Shay, ""Tequila""
Director P. Tracy ignores the cinematic cliches that surround tequila — a drink that's become synonymous with beaches, boats and babes — and, instead, sets this video in the snowy mountains of Colorado. There, we watch a love story unfold between a deaf backpacker (Nyle DiMarco, winner of both America's Next Top Model and Dancing With the Stars) and a woman who must contend with his unquenchable wanderlust (Instagram icon Mica von Turkovich). Love is the pair's universal language, and it's framed beautifully throughout.

Joshua Hedley, ""I Never (Shed a Tear)""
Joshua Hedley and his band of western-wear devotees haunt the halls of an Asian restaurant, while their leader cracks open fortune cookie after fortune cookie in search of good news. With its uncluttered premise and mid-century ambiance, ""I Never (Shed a Tear)"" shines a light on the classic-country core of Hedley's music.

American Aquarium, ""The World Is on Fire""
Two survivors slow dance in a bunker, waiting for the apocalyptic world outside to come to its senses. By the clip's end, they've grown brave enough to leave their stronghold and head back into society — or whatever's left of it. ""We must go boldly into the darkness and be the light,"" sings BJ Barham, who wrote the song during the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202572.7/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321213516-20190321235516-00207.warc.gz

Szlachetka, ""Until That Echo""
Built around a chromatic guitar riff that spirals downward into darkness, ""Until That Echo"" is a roots-rocker for late-night drives and haunted hearts. Frontman Matt Szlachetka co-wrote the song with Scott Underwood, Train's drummer of 20 years, resulting in a track that mixes deep-seated grooves with guitar heroics.

Maddie & Tae, ""Die From a Broken Heart
The strong, self-empowered teens who busted bro-country's balls with 2014's ""Girl From a Country Song"" have grown up, only to realize that adulthood can be a vulnerable place. On this light, lovely ballad, Maddie & Tae turn to their own mothers for support.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TNZyBPai5Q

The Steel Woods, ""Southern Accents""
Tom Petty's hymn-like original gets a heavy-tonk makeover. Searing guitar leads and a Stapleton-worthy vocal add some country crunch to this cover, which doubles as the first release from the Steel Woods' upcoming Old News.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8wVYg6mACU

Cale Tyson, ""Not Healthy Anymore""
This bedroom recording trades the old-world twang of Cale Tyson's past for something more evocative of Elliott Smith's dark, depressed ballads. Tyson double-tracks his own vocals, as though to keep himself company, yet his song's most striking selling point is its ability to make loneliness sound lovely.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sSsZrnfYpM

Vandoliers, ""Troublemaker""
Train beats, mariachi horns and breakneck blasts of electric guitar punctuate ""Troublemaker,"" the Vandoliers' first single for Bloodshot Records. More cowpunk than country, it's the sound of a band that's deservedly proud of its rough edges.

https://soundcloud.com/charleswesleygodwin/coal-country/s-FfztD

Charles Wesley Godwin, ""Coal Country""
The son of a West Virginia coal miner, Charles Wesley Godwin sings about the industry that's both blessed and cursed his home state for centuries. His voice, with its tight, old-world vibrato, is perfect for the song, as are the light layers of violin and pedal steel.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBdahVPD_K0

Jake Owen, ""Down to the Honkytonk""
""I'm a local legend on a Friday night in the Pabst Blue Ribbon neon light,"" Owen sings, finding fame in the ordinary trappings of bar culture. A half-lit tribute to watering holes everywhere, ""Down to the Honkytonk"" hits its marks without taking itself too seriously — just like a good bar should.

Lacy Cavalier, ""Get Away With It""
A showcase for Cavalier's poppy pipes and elastic melodies, ""Get Away With It"" finds its creator pressing charges against a man who's guilty of stealing her heart. For fans of Lucie Silvas, Adele and Maggie Rose.

Drake White, ""All Would Be Right With the World""

George Strait, ""Código""
One year or so after becoming an investor in the high-dollar tequila brand, George Strait literally sings Código's praises with this Tex-Mex twanger. ""A little rip and you're ready to roll,"" he sings, while fiddle and accordion drunkenly dance in the background.

https://youtu.be/YY4tkFlVfRI

The Last Bandoleros, ""Enamorado""
A bilingual love song, ""Enamorado"" mixes the ramped-up romance of Latin pop ballads with the hooks and harmonies of Southwestern roots music. YouTube singing star Alexander Stewart co-wrote the track and released his own version last summer, but ""Enamorado"" sounds like a Last Bandoleros original, with all four bandmates contributing to the song's layered vocals.

Chris Janson, ""Good Vibes""
""If you ain't got anything good to say, then shut your mouth,"" commands Chris Janson, who's preaches the gospel of positive thinking with this summery pop/rocker. Co-written alongside Ashley Gorley and Zach Crowell, ""Good Vibes"" delivers exactly what its title suggests: a blast of upbeat, major-key euphoria, shot through with guitar riffs and a beach-worthy bounce. The single helps kickstart Janson's promo cycle for a new album, which is slated to arrive in September.

https://youtu.be/mh7N-xw-UXk

Reba McEntire, ""Stronger Than the Truth""
On Reba McEntire's agenda for the year: a Las Vegas residency with Brooks & Dunn, a high-profile hosting gig at the ACM Awards and, most importantly, her first album since 2017's gospel-flavored Sing It Now. ""Stronger Than the Truth,"" the record's title track, is a power ballad about infidelity, with Reba looking to dull the sting of her lover's wandering ways with plenty of whiskey. Unfortunately, not even firewater can wash away the truth.

https://youtu.be/GQqlS341c3I

Molly Tuttle, ""Million Miles""
Back in October 2018, Jason Isbell tapped Molly Tuttle as an opening act during his annual residency at the Ryman Auditorium. She returns the favor with this new single, which makes gorgeous use of Isbell's vocal harmonies, Sierra Hull's mandolin playing and Tuttle's award-winning flatpicking. Also getting a piece of the action are songwriters Steve Poltz and Jewel, who began co-writing ""Million Miles"" two decades earlier. The song remained unfinished until Poltz gave it off to Tuttle — a move that feels like a passing of the folk-music torch.

https://youtu.be/wrNWrG385hg

Steve Earle & the Dukes, ""Dublin Blues""
Steve Earle's upcoming album Guy finds the songwriter setting aside his own material and, instead, paying tribute to longtime influence Guy Clark. ""Dublin Blues"" marks the record's kickoff track, with Earle and company reworking the stripped-down title track from Clark's 1995 record into an amplified Americana anthem.

https://youtu.be/7TrCfWKJSwQ

Shovels & Rope, ""The Wire""
It'll be a busy April for Shovels & Rope, whose new album By Blood arrives one day before the start of the band's yearly High Water Festival. While 2019 marks the third installment of High Water, ""The Wire"" — the duo's first release from By Blood — hints at changes on the horizon. After all, the song owes as much to indie-pop as the band's Americana roots, with a percussive pulse gluing everything together.

https://youtu.be/SRGz82scX1A

Randy Rogers Band, ""Crazy People""
Raised by devout parents in small-town Texas, Randy Rogers Band kicks off ""Crazy People"" by recalling his family's strict moral code. . .then finds a shoebox of old photographs that prove his parents once knew how to party. It's a tried-and-true country storyline, and ""Crazy People"" delivers the expected highlights, from the tongue-twisting lyrics in the chorus to the heartland hooks that run throughout.

https://youtu.be/VPIAy13xzjA

Marcus King Band, ""Goodbye Carolina""
Produced by Dave Cobb and championed by Chris Stapleton, ""Goodbye Carolina"" burns slowly, building its way toward a fiery blaze of slide-guitar pyrotechnics and Deep-South soul over six minutes. What begins as a ballad officially turns into a barn-burner during the final moments, with King's guitar leading the charge.

https://youtu.be/5Af3pHi6mWY

Lula Wiles, ""Good Old American Values""
A descendant of the Abenaki Native American tribe, Mali Obomsawin sings about the dark side of American traditions on this folky protest song. Bandmates Isa Burke and Eleanor Buckland back her up on fiddle and acoustic guitar, adding heft to a track that tackles the country's longtime habit of subjugating indigenous peoples.

Caroline Spence, ""Sit Here and Love Me""
A bare-bones ballad about the intersection between depression's gloom and compassion's sunny uplift, ""Sit Here and Love Me"" finds an anxious Caroline Spence singing directing to her partner. ""I've been this way as long as I've been here,"" she says, nodding to her ongoing struggle with anxiety while an acoustic guitar rings in the background. The solution to her issue isn't medication; it's the mere presence and support of her lover. ""I don't need you to solve any problem at all,"" she assures during the chorus, adding, ""I just need you to sit here and love me.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202628.42/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322034516-20190322060516-00205.warc.gz

Yola, ""Faraway Look""
Produced by Dan Auerbach, this country-soul showcase is cut from the same cloth as Petula Clark's ""Downtown,"" with orchestral strings that swoon and a retro-minded chorus that would have likely earned a standing ovation from Ed Sullivan's studio audience. Coupled with the previousl -released ""Ride Out in the Country,"" the song helps whip up more buzz for Yola's upcoming debut, Walk Through Fire.

Amelia White, ""Rhythm of the Rain""
Written in the midst of a European tour that kept her overseas during much of the 2016 U.S. presidential race, ""Rhythm of the Rain"" — the title track from Amelia White's newest release — is the songwriter's attempt to find a moment of zen in an increasingly maddening world. Driving home the song's central image is the steady pitter-patter of a drum loop, which wouldn't be out of place on an early Sheryl Crow record.

https://youtu.be/mSEEytTjghU

Jared Deck, ""Great American Breakdown""
Has the American Dream turned into a modern nightmare? Raised in small-town Oklahoma, Jared Deck channels the pissed-off, politically-minded punch of John Mellencamp, Steve Earle and other heartland-rock greats on this track, which explores the dark underside of the American Dream in rural America.

Maren Morris, ""Girl""
One year after topping Billboard's dance chart with ""The Middle,"" Maren Morris keeps the country-crossover party going with ""Girl."" The lead single from her upcoming sophomore release, the song finds Morris giving herself a pep talk in the mirror. It's as an empowerment anthem not only for its creator, but for women everywhere, with an R&B-accented melody worthy of Alicia Keys and a bridge that nods to Beyoncé's ""Halo.""

https://youtu.be/WdDFuI-ZcLs

Gangstagrass, ""Keep Talking""
Hip-hop percussion meets bluegrass instrumentation on this live track, which was recorded during a Gangstagrass concert in St. Louis. Banjo arpeggios and flourishes of fiddle are tucked between the song's rapped verses, creating a bridge between two seemingly disparate genres. The collective will release their live LP Pocket Full of Fire on February 15th.

Patty Griffin, ""River""
On her first album since battling breast cancer, Patty Griffin reflects upon a life filled with charms and challenges. ""River,"" the self-titled album's first single, finds Griffin shining a light on her own determination to keep flowing downstream. Shot through with bluesy vocal runs and Southern soulfulness, this is Griffin at her best: moody, melodic and proudly unbroken.

Caroline Spence, ""Mint Condition""
A member of Nashville's indie-folk underground for years, Caroline Spence goes pro with this year's Mint Condition, her debut release for Rounder Records.

Jade Bird, ""I Get No Joy""
It's been two years since Jade Bird released her career-launching EP, Something American, and the raspy-voiced Brit is ready for her full-length debut. ""I Get No Joy"" — with its tongue-twisting chorus and easygoing bounce — is the first release from her upcoming self-titled album, which hits stores one month after the March kickoff date of her American tour with Hozier. For a song about dissatisfaction, ""I Get No Joy"" is remarkably bright.

Joe Diffie, ""Quit You""
Joe Diffie has fallen off the love wagon, unable to resist the pull of an addictive relationship. ""I can crush it out, pour it down the drain, give up my vices, curse your name,"" he sings, rattling off a number of defenses that, in the end, can't convince him to quit the one he loves. Just two months shy of his 60th birthday, the ""John Deere Green"" star sings like a man reborn, flexing the same beefy baritone that serenaded radio fans during the Nineties.

Ariel Posen, ""Things That I've Said""
Between gigs as a member of roots-rockers the Brothers Landreth, Posen pieced together the songs for his own album of heartland soul. Here, he comes across like a laidback Springsteen, building an anthemic groove during the verse before singing the slacker blues during every chorus. ""I don't feel so rough when I don't measure up to the things that I've said,"" he says, punctuating the mood with slide guitar.

Kip Moore, ""Tennessee Boy""
Kip Moore sings about the simple steps that lead to love, while acoustic guitars and a kick-drummed stomp keeps everything boiling at an epic simmer. As influenced by Mumford & Sons' unplugged barn-burners as Tunnel of Love's Eighties nostalgia, ""Tennessee Boy"" is an anthemic song of the South, with Moore promoting the pleasures of moonshine, pot and lovemaking along the way.

Vera Sola, ""The Colony""
This is the sort of song that Quentin Tarantino soundtracks are made for: coolly retro and rooted in spaghetti-western desert soul. Having already logged a number of years in Elvis Perkins' band, Vera Sola makes her solo debut with this month's Shades, an album that features its creator on every instrument. ""The Colony"" is one of the record's highlights, with lyrics inspired by Sola's time assisting the Dakota Access Pipeline protestors at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.

Boy Named Banjo, ""Feel for You""
A four-on-the-floor drumbeat runs beneath this high-energy stomper, which mixes a raga-influenced banjo riff with a mighty, meteoric chorus. Come for the string-band bombast; stay for the layered vocals, which add heft and harmony to the song's refrain. Produced by Oscar Charles, ""Feel for You"" is the first taste of Boy Named Banjo's still-untitled follow-up to the 2016 EP Lost on Main.

""Ain't nobody brokenhearted in country music anymore,"" Morgan laments, mourning the loss of classic, tear-stained country hits in today's world of party-hearty bro bluster.

After launching her career as the Lumineers' only female member, Pekarek sheds her skin and kicks off a solo career with this year's Rattlesnake, a concept album about Wild West folk hero Rattlesnake Kate.

Courtney Hartman and Taylor Ashton, ""Wayside""
""Wayside"" is the opening number from Been on Your Side, a collection of original Americana duets performed by Della Mae's Courtney Hartman and Fish & Bird's Taylor Ashton. A showcase not only for their entwined vocals, but also their instrumental chops, the song mixes clawhammer banjo and acoustic guitar with a storyline about avoiding obstacles and staying the course.

This gentle, swooning folk ballad was written for the Hilary Swank film What They Had, with lyrics by director Elizabeth Chomko and co-writing assistance from both O'Donovan and Chomko's mother.

The track, off Beyoncé&apos;s Lemonade, was reportedly rejected by the Recording Academy for consideration in the country field.According to a story by the AP, Beyoncé submitted ""Daddy Lessons"" for nomination in the country category, but the Academy&apos;s country-music committee shunned the song.Beyoncé earned nine Grammy nominations when the categories were revealed on December 6th. While the bulk of the singer&apos;s nominations were in all-genre, pop and rap categories, she did make an unexpected showing in the Best Rock Performance field for the Lemonade track ""Don&apos;t Hurt Yourself,"" featuring Jack White.

110,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/beyonces-daddy-lessons-her-americana-moment-64623/,"Beyoncé&apos;s ""Daddy Lessons"" starts in New Orleans but quickly jets to her hometown of Houston, making for what some are calling her first country song.

The track, from the music icon&apos;s surprise Lemonade album released over the weekend, begins with a brass horn section plucked straight off the streets of the Big Easy. But the jazzy intro gives way to a big ""yee haw,"" followed by chants of ""Texas, Texas, oh oh oh Texas"" — and lyrics that sound plucked from Miranda Lambert&apos;s or Loretta Lynn&apos;s catalog, accompanied by a soft guitar.
""He held me in his arms/And he taught me to be strong/He told me when he&apos;s gone/Here&apos;s what you do/When trouble comes to town/And men like me come around/Oh, my daddy said shoot/Oh, my daddy said shoot,"" Beyoncé sings in the empowering, yet dark song — which arguably leans more Americana than country, given its sonic melting pot.
The gun toting tune, which even notes the Second Amendment, is all about going to whatever lengths necessary to protect yourself and your family from bad guys. It&apos;s speculated to be autobiographical, given the superstar&apos;s complex relationship with her father. ""Daddy Lessons"" is the only track on Lemonade that Beyoncé produced solo.

Rich took offense at socks that Kaepernick was photographed wearing in 2016 during practice sessions when he was signed to the San Francisco 49ers. The sock depicted cartoon pigs in police uniforms.

The ""Don&apos;t It"" singer will keep summer alive in more than 20 cities on the trek, which launches in San Antonio, Texas, and is slated to wrap on April 16th in Tampa, Florida.

Joining Currington for select dates will be 2015 breakout star Kelsea Ballerini, the CMA-nominated hitmaker whose ""Love Me Like You Mean It"" topped the Billboard Country Airplay chart and made her the first solo female artist in nine years to hit Number One with her debut country single. Ballerini served up a memorable take on ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" during the CMA Country Christmas special, which aired earlier this month. ""Dibs,"" her second single from the debut LP The First Time, is currently in the Top 15.
Currington spent the summer on Tim McGraw&apos;s Shotgun Rider Tour and released his sixth studio album — also titled Summer Forever — in June. The LP&apos;s first single, ""Don&apos;t It,"" became his 10th chart-topper since 2005&apos;s ""Must Be Doin&apos; Somethin&apos; Right,"" but the follow-up release, ""Drinkin&apos; Town With a Football Problem,"" barely cracked the Top 30. Currington is also among the acts lined up for the Tortuga Music Festival, held April 15th through 17th at Fort Lauderdale Beach Park in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

During CMT&apos;s annual upfront presentation this morning in New York City, the cable network announced a full slate of original programming, including a scripted series starring Cyrus as an Elvis-loving charlatan preacher. Titled Still the King, the show is slated to premiere in early 2016.
""I play a dysfunctional Elvis impersonator who ends up lying his way into a church out of desperation, to help pay his child support,"" Cyrus tells Rolling Stone Country. The singer-actor, whose past television experience includes the series Doc and Hannah Montana (starring superstar daughter Miley Cyrus), will executive produce and write for Still the King.
Related: Christina Aguilera to Play Country Wannabe on &apos;Nashville&apos;
He also plans to leverage his music business ties to incorporate guest stars and their songs. Randy Travis has a cameo in the pilot as a sheriff (filmed before his 2013 stroke), and Shooter Jennings is set to make an appearance in a house band.
""I like shows I can bring music into and I&apos;m very excited about the possibilities of where this can go. I&apos;m looking forward to cutting some Elvis tunes,"" Cyrus says. ""And Shooter can play [his songs] when he&apos;s onstage. It&apos;s a great platform for all of us, a little place to go out and hawk our homemade quilts.""
Along with Still the King, CMT will roll out a new reality series following Kellie Pickler and her songwriter husband Kyle Jacobs. Tentatively titled I Love Kellie Pickler, the show will chronicle their quirky he said/she said romance and lifestyle. Ryan Seacrest, Pickler&apos;s old American Idol pal, is the show&apos;s producer.
""It finally feels right with the people that we’re working with [Seacrest], and having CMT as our home.  There&apos;s no drama, there&apos;s no cat fights. Nothing like that,"" Pickler tells Rolling Stone Country. ""We just want to be a bright light and make people happy — make &apos;em feel good and help them get away from their day a little bit.""
In addition to the Cyrus and Pickler vehicles, the network announced the May 14th premiere of the bawdy and boozy Party Down South 2 and the airdate for its 2015 CMT Music Awards, which will be held June 10th in Nashville. The CMT Artists of the Year special will also return in December.
Cyrus recently premiered a new song with Jennings on Rolling Stone Country. A haunting duet, ""Killin&apos; the Blues"" will be released on Record Store Day, April 18th, by Jennings&apos; Black Country Rock label.

Later in 1992, his daughter Destiny Hope was born. She would soon be rechristened Miley, a reflection of her smiling nature as an infant, and would go on to star in the Disney Channel series Hannah Montana with her dad – and would also become one of the world's biggest pop stars. In a wide-ranging interview with ET Online, the elder Cyrus talked about his daughter's newfound sobriety and her more refined style, which stands in contrast with some of the more controversial fashions and live-performance antics of the young singer's past.""As a dad, I see Miley really just functioning on, like, a figure and a joy for life,"" Cyrus told ET's Nancy O'Dell. ""I don't know how to break it down more than just the fact that I see a joy in her spirit and something coming from within that is just pure beauty, if you will.""In a candid cover story for Billboard, which hit newsstands last week, the ""Wrecking Ball"" singer noted she was ""completely clean,"" having gone three weeks without smoking marijuana at the time that interview took place.""I think she just found… she's firing off all cylinders,"" the elder Cyrus says. ""Her thoughts, her instincts, everything is at the top of its game,"" he added. ""Sometimes you have to clear out the junk. And then you realize what's most important. Whatever is going on, it's working for her.""Miley Cyrus is also working on new music, which her dad notes is a rootsy collection built around a number of musical influences, including Johnny Cash and her godmother, Dolly Parton. ""I'm so excited about this album,"" Cyrus says, making mention of a romantic track his daughter has dedicated to her fiancé, actor Liam Hemsworth. ""Miley really leaned into her roots with this new album."" Cyrus adds that Miley's upbringing as the daughter of a country artist – one who faced a great deal of criticism after his debut single became a huge country-pop crossover and line-dance hit – was a major influence on her musically. Miley Cyrus' single ""Malibu"" is expected to be released May 11th. Miley's dad, meanwhile, recently re-recorded his ""Achy Breaky Heart"" with members of Alabama's famed Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, the Swampers, and also released a Spanglish version.

116,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/billy-strings-bluegrass-must-see-774144/,"Watching guitarist Billy Strings onstage is akin to observing a hummingbird in its natural state.

Strings’ fingers zoom up and down the fretboard of his acoustic in an intricate and calculated frenzy. The scene may appear haphazard at first, but he’s in complete control, determinedly chasing that cosmic moment of improvisation.

“I grew up playing bluegrass with my dad. That’s how I cut my teeth when I was a little kid, and how I learned how to play music. But I learned how to perform when I was in a metal band, and that energy stuck with me,” Strings tells Rolling Stone. “There’s a lot of speed in both [bluegrass and metal]. When I think of Earl Scruggs on banjo, or some really fast bluegrass banjo, you can almost relate that to really fast metal or Slayer or something. It makes me feel almost the same thing — it’s fucking speedy.”

At 26, Strings (a.k.a.: William Apostol) is one of the fastest rising pickers of the last decade. Hailing from rural central Michigan, Strings (he was given the nickname by his aunt who recognized his abilities early on) has been a road dog for several years now, playing upwards of 200 gigs a year with his band, their black Sprinter van and a gear trailer. In 2017, he released the album Turmoil & Tinfoil, a collection of songs that, while based around the tenets of bluegrass, isn't afraid to look forward or celebrate youth.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRnNDd6_Im0

""You can't stop us from dancing/ you can't stop us from feeling high/ we can't help it if we like to stay out all night,"" Strings sings in the lead-off track ""On the Line."" In the song ""Dealing Despair,"" he addresses the rising tide of hate in the U.S., howling, ""You know I don’t want your opinion, I just want to blow out your brains."" Edgy stuff, to be sure.

“I mean, there’s people out there that think what I do is absolutely insane or the opposite of bluegrass. And they’re not necessarily wrong, we do a lot of psychedelic, crazy stuff,” Strings admits. “But if you come and talk to me or sit down and pick with me, you won’t find somebody who’s more into the history of bluegrass or the fathers of bluegrass.”

Whether or not Strings “is” or “is not” bluegrass is up to a purist's interpretation. But to his growing base of fans, he's undeniably a thrilling live artist, delivering frenetic, head-banging performances that have made him a favorite of festival crowds. His “King & Strings” collaboration, with his electric guitar counterpart Marcus King, was the stuff of legend at Virginia’s Rooster Walk festival last summer.

“We’re never going to be a band that sells a million records. We’re just a band that’s going to sell a million tickets — one show at a time. That’s what we do. We’re a live band. Our thing is our show,” Strings says. “We’re going to have real fans, that really buy tickets, that really come to the show, that really are part of this family, which is what it feels like right now.”

It's Strings' own family that first exposed him to bluegrass. He was raised on the “high, lonesome sound” by his stepfather Terry Barber, a well-regarded guitar picker in his own right within Michigan and Midwestern bluegrass circles.

“[Bluegrass is] a reminder of my childhood. When I listen to Bill Monroe or the Stanley Brothers, it’s almost like a portal straight back to when I was a really young boy and the music that my dad played for me,” Strings says. “I’m really grateful he did that because I have a good life now, all because he taught me guitar, Doc Watson and stuff — it brings me back to that love for my dad. Everyday I’m onstage, I’m doing it for the old man.”

Last June, Strings’ personal and professional life came full circle when he found himself opening for the Del McCoury Band at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, the onetime home of the Grand Ole Opry (Strings will make his Opry debut in March). At one point in the show, Strings appeared onstage to sing a duet with McCoury, with Barber by his side.

“That was a huge moment for [my dad], as well as me — a full circle thing,” Strings says. “He taught me about this music, and now I get to take him to the actual places where it was done.""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKYLR5Aa5HI

For a short period in 2017, Strings found himself playing guitar in the David Grisman Bluegrass Experience. Known throughout his life as “Dawg,” the 73-year-old took Strings under his wing, sharing his knowledge and wisdom, something that’s at the heart of why folks are so attracted to the sounds, culture and lore that is bluegrass.

“I learned [from David] that there’s no surface that you could ever reach, as far as music,” Strings says. “I was riding around in a van with David for a week. And the whole time we were listening to Bill Monroe’s music. Dawg looked back at me and said, ‘Man, I’ve been listening to Bill Monroe for 50 years and I still haven’t scratched the surface.’ There’s still so much left to learn about Bill Monroe, and David has been studying him for 50 years now.”

It's that notion of being “close to the source” — taking the time to sit and learn from the elders and passing it along — that Strings, like many bluegrass pickers, keeps top of mind. Still, he's compelled to go against the grain as needed.

“Don’t be afraid to change [bluegrass] and make it your own. But at the same time, don’t lose the essence of bluegrass,” he says. “If you know about the ‘source’ or know about Monroe, then you can branch off from that. But I think you need to know about [the history] first.”

And be open to other genres too. He cites Jimi Hendrix, Pearl Jam and the death metal of his past as sounds that inspire him as a songwriter.

""Whenever I write music, I don’t try to write a bluegrass song or singer-songwriter song or anything. I try to let the songs just come out how they are,"" he says. ""Whether it’s bluegrass, folk, heavy metal or singer-songwriter, whatever it is, I don’t really know. I’m trying not to be in control of that; I’m really trying to let that be in control of me.”

However, as a fiercely independent artist, Strings isn't willing to give up all control. ""We’re not going anywhere we don’t want to be,” he says.

It's that sense of rebellious freedom, both artistic and personal, that continues to motivate the phenom, who will launch a lengthy winter tour January 24th in Bloomington, Indiana.

“The reason I love this so much is because it is like we’re on a pirate ship,"" he says. ""Not because there’s somebody pointing their finger in my face saying, ‘I can’t believe you said the f-word onstage’ or ‘You can’t put this song on your record.’”

Twelve months later, she's covering the song once again, this time as a special guest on Blackberry Smoke's live EP, The Southern Ground Sessions.

""Not long ago, we went into Southern Ground Studios in Nashville to record some acoustic versions of songs from our album Find a Light,"" says Blackberry Smoke frontman Charlie Starr, who navigates his band through a mournful, melancholy cover of the Heartbreakers staple. ""We had some special guests come in — the Wood Brothers and Amanda Shires — and while Amanda was there, we decided to play a version of 'You Got Lucky.' [It's] just such an incredibly written song; it's just perfect, as are so many Tom Petty songs.""

In the video above, the expanded version of Blackberry Smoke's lineup captures ""You Got Lucky"" in a single live take, with Shires performing Benmont Tench's signature synthesizer riff on fiddle. The choruses are stacked high with harmonized voices, while the song's extended ending finds Starr and Shires trading solos. The result is a moving tribute to Petty, who would have turned 68 on October 20th.

They also previewed their upcoming new album, Like an Arrow, with a fierce take on ""Waiting for the Thunder.""Throughout, brothers Richard and Brit Turner held down a driving rhythm section on bass and drums, respectively, while keyboard player Brandon Still doled out gospel organ that took the crowd to church. A twangy blues cover of Led Zeppelin&apos;s ""Your Time Is Gonna Come"" was bolstered by guitarist Paul Jackson&apos;s smoky riffs, which had fans on the lawn vibrating.The most bona fide country moment, however, saw Starr trading in his electric SG for an acoustic Gibson SJ-200, delivering the hopeful ballad ""Ain&apos;t Got the Blues,"" off 2012&apos;s The Whippoorwill. The drawling singer gave his pure voice a chance to shine after belting out rocker after rocker, lingering over the lyric, ""If I ain&apos;t got ten, brother, I got nine / The good lord smiling down on me / ain&apos;t a worry on my mind.""The loudest ovation came when Starr welcomed Robinson to the stage. Together, they launched into the Crowes&apos; ""Wiser Time,"" off 1994&apos;s Amorica, with Starr swaggering through his vocal turn. Robinson, meanwhile, embellished the solo he played on the original, tiring out his fretboard before trading riffs with Starr to end in a climactic display of guitar fireworks. Like an Arrow, Blackberry Smoke&apos;s fifth studio album, following the Number One Holding All the Roses, will be released October 14th. The album features a guest appearance from Gregg Allman, who was forced to cancel his appearance at the Peach Music Festival to deal with ""serious health issues"" under his doctor&apos;s care at the Mayo Clinic. In his stead, members of the String Cheese Incident and Allman Brothers Band alumni performed Allman nuggets as the ""Allman Brothers Family Incident.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912207618.95/warc/CC-MAIN-20190327020750-20190327042750-00319.warc.gz

So the news hit hard for the Atlanta, Georgia outfit when Gregg Allman, the band's singer, pianist and primary songwriter, died Saturday at 69 at his home in Savannah.""It is with heavy heart[s] that we say farewell to Gregg Allman, the man, and perhaps we embrace his music even more tightly than we did before,"" Starr tells Rolling Stone Country. ""Gregg's influence on musicians of our generation is immeasurable. He was simply the greatest in his field. The songs, the voice, the emotion ... Not to mention he was without a doubt one of the absolute coolest rock & roll guys to have ever walked this earth.""Blackberry Smoke collaborated with Allman on ""Free on the Wing,"" the final track from their 2016 LP Like an Arrow. It was one of the final songs that Allman, who had suffered from various health problems in recent years, recorded before his death. ""I'm honored to be a tiny part of his recorded legacy. Thank you, Gregg. We love you,"" Starr adds.In an interview with Rolling Stone Country at the time of Like an Arrow’s release, Starr explained that recording with Allman was had been one of the band's dream collaborators. ""When we started to record, I think it was a selfish daydream we had: How great would it be to have Gregg Allman on this song?"" he recalled. ""We've become friendly with Gregg over the years and worked with him some, and he said yes.""Starr expanded upon the influence that Allman and his band's music had on Blackberry Smoke as well as all of Southern rock, the genre that the Allmans, more than any other act, helped create.""If you want to talk about the term 'Southern Rock,' they birthed it. You can even be specific and say Duane Allman birthed it. People talk about his outro solo on Wilson Pickett's version of 'Hey Jude' and say it's the birth of Southern rock music,"" Starr said. ""Were it not for Gregg Allman, we wouldn't be making music.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202688.89/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322180106-20190322202106-00307.warc.gz
123,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/blackberry-smoke-on-their-strange-country-success-77876/,"It&apos;s a stormy Good Friday afternoon in Nashville and the members of Blackberry Smoke are soundchecking on the stage of the Ryman Auditorium. A tornado warning siren sounds in the distance, but it doesn&apos;t faze the long-haired players. They are focused squarely on that night&apos;s milestone gig: a sold-out show at the historic venue, the Mother Church of Country Music. The Southern rock band has always had an affinity for country — they recorded ""Yesterday&apos;s Wine"" with George Jones for their 2009 album, Little Piece of Dixie, and toured with Zac Brown Band — but their new LP, Holding All the Roses, solidified that connection. Upon its release in February, the album debuted at Number One on Billboard&apos;s Country Albums chart.

Nearly two months later, it still strikes the band — singer-guitarist Charlie Starr, drummer Brit Turner, his bassist brother Richard Turner, guitarist Paul Jackson and keys man Brandon Still — as somewhat of an oddity. After all, ""Rock & Roll"" is painted in big letters on Brit Turner&apos;s kick drum.
""I have another one that says &apos;Country,&apos;"" he quips backstage, where he and Starr are decompressing after soundcheck. ""But I don&apos;t know, man. A lot of people have said that rock & roll radio disappeared and became pop and rap, and the only thing similar to it was country music. It was Eighties rock production and it was an easy fit, so that may have had something to do with it.""
Whatever the reason for their country crossover, the Atlanta-based group is grateful for the success. With next to no radio support, Blackberry Smoke have been building a loyal base on the road, so when Holding All the Roses hit stores, fans were ready to snatch it up. It&apos;s a sign that the old-fashioned system of tireless touring behind an honest product still works.
""It&apos;s a good solid climb. We work hard and we see results. I don&apos;t feel like we&apos;re sliding back,"" says Turner.
Though the band came dangerously close to doing just that with its last album, 2012&apos;s underrated The Whippoorwill. Released on Zac Brown&apos;s Southern Ground Artists, the album broke the Top 10 on the Country Albums chart but suffered from a label staff stretched too thin. 
""God bless Zac, he&apos;s our friend, but things fells apart,"" Starr says. ""I mean, he&apos;s a busy guy, he can&apos;t micromanage a record label. Steve Gorman [of the Black Crowes] said, &apos;Hell, the Beatles couldn&apos;t even make a label work.&apos;""
Now on Rounder Records, Blackberry Smoke is back on solid ground. ""It really feels like we earned it, having a Number One album. At Rounder, all cylinders are firing. To come from nothing, we can really look at what we&apos;ve accomplished and say, &apos;We did that.&apos;""
It&apos;s that dark horse spirit that permeates Holding All the Roses, produced by Brendan O&apos;Brien (Bruce Springsteen, AC/DC), and especially its title track. While Starr says the song wasn&apos;t written about the band, it has since come to mirror their journey.
""We were walking through Berlin, Germany, to get ice cream — we&apos;re so rock & roll,"" says Starr, ""and those lyrics started to come out, so I jotted them down on my phone. It&apos;s the idea of the underdog.""

To personify that notion, the band enlisted two local Georgia eccentrics — Digger and Tim — to appear on the album&apos;s back cover art. (The front cover depicts a mule decorated via Photoshop in top hat and roses that Turner photographed in a hotel parking lot in New Orleans.)
""[&apos;Holding All the Roses&apos;] is about dudes like Digger and Tim. If those dudes were to do something fantastic and win something, it&apos;d be, &apos;How the hell did you do that?&apos;"" says Starr. ""And now the whole thing comes full circle because [the album] then debuts at Number One on the country charts. So it is about us. You can&apos;t make this shit up.""
""It also plays into that theme of when you win, what do you really win?"" adds Turner.
Later that evening, Blackberry Smoke certainly look like winners, roaring through a loud and raucous set at the Ryman. The performance is undeniably a Southern rock revival, full of swampy guitar licks and Starr&apos;s yelping vocals. At one point, the group welcomes Cinderella&apos;s Tom Keifer, a longtime Nashville resident, onstage to perform the Eighties hard-rock heavyweights&apos; ""Heartbreak Station"" and a cover of the Rolling Stones&apos; ""Brown Sugar."" One of Starr&apos;s earlier concert memories was of attending Cinderella&apos;s Long Cold Winter Tour in Columbus, Georgia, as a teenager. Keifer&apos;s cameo is another nod to Blackberry Smoke&apos;s rock roots.
""A lot of country now is leaning more toward rock and a Southern rock feel. But of every artist I can think of in recent memory that has been called &apos;Southern rock,&apos; the most authentic one I heard is Blackberry Smoke,"" Keifer tells Rolling Stone Country. ""I remember hearing them the first time and thinking, &apos;This is the real deal.&apos; It felt as real to me as the Allmans or Skynyrd.""
Keifer&apos;s comments are on the money. With Blackberry Smoke leading the charge, country music is in the midst of a Southern rock resurgence, as likeminded groups such as the Cadillac Three and A Thousand Horses ready new albums. Today, the Cadillac Three premiered their new single ""White Lightning&apos;"" on Sirius/XM, while A Thousand Horses&apos; ""Smoke"" enters the Top 10 on Billboard&apos;s Country Airplay chart.
The Number One debut of Holding All the Roses certainly backs up the idea that country is the new home of Southern rock. And with album cuts like ""Too High,"" for which the band filmed a spooky meth-lab video, and ""Lay It All on Me"" (co-written with Nashville songwriter Travis Meadows) incorporating fiddle and pedal steel into the mix, it sounds like a natural union.
Even one of the album&apos;s hardest rockers, ""Wish in One Hand"" — with its devilish chorus of ""wish in one hand and shit in the other"" — started out as a country ballad.
""It was like waltz time,"" says Starr, ""but some songs will just grow a different set of legs.
""It was about a specific person, I won&apos;t say who it is, but they felt so entitled,"" he continues. ""You meet people like that and you look at them like, &apos;What makes you think you can come in here and drink all our beer? Who are you again?&apos; We don&apos;t give a shit; we don&apos;t like you.""
Starr says he&apos;s heard the off-color phrase countless times from working alongside older Southern men in Georgia. ""There was one guy who would say it all the time,"" he recalls. ""And if you asked him for a cigarette, he&apos;d say, &apos;Boy, I don&apos;t give away nothing but hard dicks and black eyes.&apos; I can&apos;t fit that into a song though.""
Turner laughs loudly. ""But it&apos;d be a helluva tour name.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203548.81/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325031213-20190325053213-00135.warc.gz

The six-track EP collects acoustic versions of songs taken from Blackberry Smoke's latest LP, Find a Light, plus a cover, with these renditions all cut at Zac Brown's Southern Ground Studios in Nashville. A chugging rock riff with a jackhammer breakdown and guitar solo on the album version, this new recording of ""Run Away From It All"" sees singer Charlie Starr and company huddled around microphones as they strum away from the comfort of some stools. The song takes on a more relaxed and wistful vibe, but the same simmering urgency of the original bubbles just beneath the surface.
The Southern Ground Sessions takes another page from the Find a Light playbook by welcoming in some guest players, including Amanda Shires — who appeared on the LP and pops up here twice, including on a cover of Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers' 1982 cut ""You Got Lucky"" — and Oliver Wood.

The future tour mates announced the news during a Facebook Live exchange yesterday evening. (Watch the video below.) Sitting in his trailer before another Voice episode in Hollywood, Shelton kicked off the live stream alone, with RaeLynn eventually ""calling in"" and joining the conversation via her living room couch. Together, the two engaged in a Newlyweds Game-influenced skit before reading off the 13 cities that make up the upcoming run.Takeaways from the game include RaeLynn&apos;s preference for footed pajamas and Shelton&apos;s obsession with vodka and queso. The real highlights, though, were the pair&apos;s teasing banter and obvious affection for each other, both of which date back to the weeks in which Shelton coached a pre-fame RaeLynn during the first half of The Voice&apos;s 2012 season.

Such across-the-footlights charisma is Shelton's gift, along with a voice that remains one of the most underrated – and underused – in the genre.Sure, Shelton has an impressive string of hits, but mid-tempos like ""Doin' What She Likes"" and ""A Guy With a Girl"" all seem to run together, especially in a live setting. Compared to the bounce of ""Some Beach"" and the brooding of ""Ole Red,"" loping songs like ""She's Got a Way With Words"" and ""Sangria"" feel indistinguishable, less unique entries in a catalog and more like ways to fill space in a setlist. It can be frustrating, especially for fans hip to Shelton's prowess – his vocals and way with a lyric are on par with some of his own heroes, like Earl Thomas Conley. That aside, Shelton delivered an only-at-CMA-Fest experience for the lucky crowd, a chance to view a bona fide superstar of the format in a relatively intimate venue – at least when compared to the cavernous Nissan Stadium where he'll perform later tonight. ""All About Tonight"" was a boozy honky-tonker, ""Hillbilly Bone"" glowed from Shelton's swagger and ""Neon Light"" proved that the Oklahoma native's later work still resembles the classic country he so often praises.

In conjunction with Shelton's nods to country music's past, he's just released a deliciously tipsy version of ""Tequila Sheila,"" a Top 40 country hit from 1980 originally recorded by Bobby Bare for his live — and wildly funny — Down & Dirty LP.

Shelton, who already has a large supply of drinking songs in his repertoire, kicks off this one, which was penned by comic tunesmiths Mac Davis and the late Shel Silverstein, with some tasty Spanish guitar followed a raucous spoken intro from Bare himself.

Presented with the same live feel to it as the rowdy original, the song's tale of Shelton's card-playing exploits south of the border in Juarez, Mexico, finds him encouraging the title character to rid herself of her red satin dress and ""lay down and love me again."" In the second verse, he sings, ""No, I can't tell you about it but don't mind my gun by the bed, I feel kind of naked without it and it eases the fears in my head.""

""One of the coolest things I've been able to do in my career, because I've been fortunate, is be a little selfish along the way and be able to record some songs that I grew up loving,"" said Shelton in a statement. ""I feel like they have helped shape who I am as an artist and were what inspired me to want to be a country singer. I recorded this song and didn't really have a plan for it — I just wanted to have my own version.

Last week, Shelton found himself atop another multi-genre chart — the Billboard 200 — with his latest album, Bringing Back the Sunshine. The project, which revisits grittier topics like hard-drinking and harder breakups, is a throwback to his earliest catalog of music and to his musical heroes.

On this week&apos;s Artist 100 chart, another country act follows Shelton&apos;s lead: Florida Georgia Line has landed in the top spot. Bolstered by the release of their second album Anything Goes, which debuted at Number One on both the country albums chart and the all-genre Billboard 200, the duo swaggered into Number One on the Artist 100. Taylor Swift, who releases her pop album 1989 next week, is in the Number Two slot — but likely not for long.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203326.34/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324043400-20190324065400-00153.warc.gz

The following year, Shelton and the Band Perry performed snippets of Campbell&apos;s music at the 2012 Grammy Awards before introducing the singer himself for a spirited performance of ""Rhinestone Cowboy."" Last year, Tim McGraw filled in for Campbell at the Academy Awards, delivering the chilling ""I&apos;m Not Gonna Miss You,"" the nominated song from the documentary Glen Campbell…I&apos;ll Be Me.Campbell, who is in the late stages of Alzheimer&apos;s, will receive the ACM Career Achievement Award during the ACM Honors.

Last night, he reminded us what a compelling entertainer he can be, headlining the 12th annual Stars for Second Harvest presented by O&apos;Charley&apos;s benefit show at Nashville&apos;s Ryman Auditorium. The show, hosted by lauded songwriter Craig Wiseman and benefiting the Second Harvest Food Bank of Middle Tennessee, also featured Shane McAnally, Josh Osborne, Kane Brown and Chris Lane.

For Shelton&apos;s set, there was no band, no backup singers nor video footage. Just the singer, his acoustic guitar and a stool, similar to any given writer&apos;s night in Nashville clubs. Despite the absence of the typical concert spectacles, he had the sellout crowd spellbound, the mark of a true entertainer.
Not that he was short on quips. After kicking off the short set with ""Ol&apos; Red,"" Shelton asked the crowd for a ""Taylor Swift moment"" of interaction, exhorting the folks to raise their cell phones in the air for his poignant ""Home."" ""Just keep doing that throughout this song,"" he encouraged. ""That&apos;s so cool.""
Following that, Shelton began strumming the opening chords of his new single, ""She&apos;s Got a Way With Words,"" already the subject of considerable buzz for its perceived lashing out about his split from Miranda Lambert. ""Are all my songs this slow?"" he suddenly interjected, drawing laughs from the audience. ""I&apos;m getting depressed playing my own shit.""
Shelton also proclaimed himself ""the world&apos;s worst guitar player"" before abandoning the self-deprecating comedy, at least briefly. He turned serious in praise of host Craig Wiseman, the prolific songwriter who has penned several major hits for Shelton. ""Some of my favorite songs were written by Craig Wiseman,"" Shelton noted. ""The fact that he does this [benefit show] every year says a lot about him."" Shelton went on to reprise his hits ""Came Here to Forget"" and ""Boys &apos;Round Here,"" both co-written by Wiseman. The songwriter even provided the ""Red, red, red"" opener for ""Boys &apos;Round Here,"" which had the audience singing along in unison.
Wiseman played the role of affable host and also contributed to the fascinating opening segment featuring award-winning tunesmiths Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne. The three shared the stories behind their biggest hits, including Kacey Musgraves&apos; ""Merry Go &apos;Round"" and Sam Hunt&apos;s ""Leave the Night On,"" which McAnally and Osborne co-wrote with the respective artists.
The big winner of the night was, naturally, Second Harvest. Over the years, Wiseman&apos;s star-laden benefit has raised more than $1 million in support of the community-minded food bank.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202628.42/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322034516-20190322060516-00326.warc.gz

Since the show&apos;s 1975 debut, only Garth Brooks, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Tim McGraw and Taylor Swift (back when she was a country artist), have pulled double duty as host and guest representing country music. What&apos;s more, the last country act to perform on the show was Lady Antebellum, in October 2011. Naturally, Shelton is aware of the pressure that comes with the hosting gig… and his performance.

""I&apos;m not really nervous,"" Blake insists in the promotional clip below, which reveals plenty of his comedic instinct. ""I&apos;m a natural at making an ass out of myself. If that&apos;s what this show requires of me, I think I&apos;m gonna nail it.""
The Oklahoma native adds that when he told his family he would be hosting, his mom and sister had some special requests. ""[My mom] wanted me to tell Chevy Chase hi, and my sister wanted me to get Dana Carvey&apos;s autograph,"" Shelton quips. ""So it shows you just how out of touch my family is."" (For the record: Chase has not been an SNL cast member since 1976. Carvey left the show in 1993.) Although she may be among those watching the live telecast, Shelton says his wife, fellow country superstar Miranda Lambert, won&apos;t be in NBC&apos;s Studio H-8 as the show unfolds. (She has a show in West Virginia Saturday night.) The outspoken Shelton admits his wife is worried about him hosting SNL and can be a bit of a ""stage mom.""
""Miranda&apos;s always the one when we&apos;re at parties or something and I&apos;m being funny and I start taking it too far into gross land or whatever, she&apos;s the one that&apos;s always like, &apos;Blake! Blake, stop it,"" he tells E! News.
No word yet on what current events or hot topics the comedy sketches will cover, but one glance at the singer&apos;s unexpurgated Twitter feed is proof that his handlers have their work cut out for them.
""Last night I had a few drinks and had to go off about a movie I want to see,"" Shelton tells E! with his patented mischievous grin. ""I like to go on Twitter and have fun, and I make my managers nervous as heck.""
In a series of tweets he posted Monday night (January 19th), Shelton began by noting, ""I can&apos;t WAIT to see American Sniper,"" the Oscar-nominated film that drew criticism from filmmaker Michael Moore, who tweeted a day earlier that ""snipers aren&apos;t heroes,"" setting off a firestorm of controversy in the media. Just shortly after his tweet about wanting to see the film, Shelton tweeted: ""Sickens me to see celebrities or anybody slam the very people who protect their right to talk shit."" He added the hashtag #truecowards, perhaps referring to Moore&apos;s lengthier Facebook post in which he quoted his father, who served as a Marine in World War II, as saying, ""Snipers are cowards. They don&apos;t believe in a fair fight.""
Aside from Shelton, Lady Antebellum and Swift, who has been musical guest twice and host once, SNL&apos;s most recent musical guests from the country world have been Keith Urban in 2007 and Carrie Underwood in 2007 and 2008.

The irreverent spots hawking the brand&apos;s new bacon and cheese-stuffed crust pizza are Pure BS — to nick the title of the singer&apos;s 2007 album.

""I saw Taylor Swift this week,"" he told Rolling Stone Country during a break in filming. ""She said, &apos;You&apos;re so funny in those Pizza Hut commercials!&apos; And I said, &apos;Yeah, Taylor. That was my goal all along as a kid: to make it to this level in country music so I could sell the most amount of pizzas possible… reach the biggest audience of pizzas that I possibly can.""
When we caught up with Shelton, he&apos;d had only one day off in the last 10 days. He admits to spending it on the couch. The commercial shoot was shoehorned into an already-packed late summer schedule that includes his current Ten Times Crazier Tour 2014, and taping the seventh season of The Voice.
His autumn calendar doesn&apos;t look any easier. The Voice debuts September 22nd, and his 11th studio album, Bringing Back the Sunshine, streets September 30th. And after a string of dates that included Madison Square Garden and Wrigley Field — where he played to 40,000 fans — his tour wraps up at the iconic Hollywood Bowl on October 4th.
""Yes, it&apos;s definitely going to be a big fall,"" he says ruefully. ""It&apos;s funny, because every year for the past 10 years, I&apos;ve had this phone call with my manager where I say, &apos;Hey man, this fall… I&apos;m not kidding this time, I&apos;m not doing it. I don&apos;t care what it is. I&apos;m tired, I want to protect my fall — that&apos;s when deer season starts. I just want to be home.&apos; And here we go again.""
But Shelton isn&apos;t looking this gift-horse in the mouth. He&apos;d just rather it have antlers.
""At least I&apos;m at this point in my life where I&apos;m only doing things I&apos;m excited about and believe in,"" he shares, ""because to be on this side of my career, I don&apos;t have to beat my head against the wall anymore, and that&apos;s fun.""
The conversation was interrupted when someone on the set yelled, ""Rolling!"" People started tip-toeing around the stage, but that didn&apos;t necessarily mean we needed to be quiet.

They're kicking off the party with a new song and video for ""Radio,"" from the band's upcoming In Unison.
A road anthem loaded with pedal-steel punch, muddily-harmonized melodies and a steady, Springsteen-worthy pace, ""Radio"" sounds as though it was spawned somewhere between a garage band's oil-stained headquarters and a dive bar deep in the Bible Belt. The video sets up shop in a different location, though, recasting the Nashville band's four members as space travelers exploring the surreal landscape of the great beyond. There are UFOs, oversized rodents, deep-sea creatures and buzzing radio towers, all tossed into a collage whose sheer bizarreness suits the band's own offbeat bounce.
""At first, the chorus to 'Radio' started as, 'How he loved that rusty Cadillac/What's built by man won't ever last,' and was meant to be a meditation on the impermanence of our material world,"" explains singer Jonathon Childers. ""I wanted the song to have a more positive outlook, and at the time my relationship was beginning to blossom. When juxtaposed, the realization that human connection lives on when all else fades away seemed an honest place to take it.""

140,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/blaze-ben-dickey-new-album-806414/,"When Ben Dickey returned home to his farm in Louisiana after spending months working on Ethan Hawke’s film Blaze, he fell into a depression. “I was still in a Blaze way,” says Dickey, who, after playing the role of Seventies country outsider Blaze Foley in his acting debut, says he began to assume some of Foley’s personal troubles even after the project ended.

“When it was over, I suffered from not knowing how to pull myself out of Blazetown,” he says. “I thought, the thing that I should do is wander. That’s what will make me feel better. If you introduce somebody else’s demons to your own demons and they start talking, watch out.”

It was January 2017, but sitting at home, Dickey ultimately fought the urge to “book a weird Southern tour” and instead began writing songs. Lots of them. Nearly 30, in fact, over the next two months. “I tend to write in clusters,” he says. “When I made Blaze I stopped doing that, which spooked me. So when I corked that channel, a lot of that energy had built up.”

A full year later, Dickey, 41, has released A Glimmer on the Outskirts, the result of those several months of writing in the midst of his post-Blaze funk. Dickey has spent the better part of the past decades in a rotating, nearly endless stream of various bands — country-rock groups, noise-rock bands, old-school rock & roll outfits — but Glimmer is a roots-rock solo effort and the singer’s second solo album. The album, his first since exponentially raising his profile with Hawke’s critically adored film, channels the warmth of Nineties-era Tom Petty. Highlights like “Monstrous Moonshine (Come Back Down)"" and “Stranger on a Silver Horse (Be Amazed)” mark some of the most realized songs Dickey has released to date.

The album, completed last year but shelved in favor of promoting his film debut last fall, was produced by legendary Austin guitarist and Blaze co-star Charlie Sexton, who gave Dickey a strict plan for the project.

“This is what we’re gonna do,” Sexton told Dickey early on. “Send me 20 songs, I’ll pick 10, and we can arm wrestle over one.”

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUWQkiN2QoQ

For Dickey, having a proper producer felt like a huge luxury. The album is meticulously arranged, with spacious rock and folk arrangements that center Dickey’s honeyed vocals. “It’s unified, big time,” as he puts it. A Glimmer on the Outskirts marks a large professional step forward for Dickey, who had recorded his last album (2016’s Sexy Birds and Salt Water Classics) on days off from his job as a sous-chef at the Philadelphia live-music venue and gastropub Johnny Brenda’s.

“Making that record was a Hail Mary for my well-being,” he says of his 2016 solo debut. “My band had broken up. I was deranged about that. I was working in the kitchen 80 hours a week. My brain was melting. I needed to have something.”

It can be hard to follow the chronology of the many musical lives of Ben Dickey, who constantly references his countless bands and short-lived previous musical selves in conversation: Amen Booze Roster, Blood Feathers, Shake Ray Turbine, to name a few. Dickey came of age in the punk world of his hometown of Little Rock, Arkansas. “I played Marshall amps and roared and wanted to be Fugazi.”

Dickey would eventually get the slightest taste of his dream with Shake Ray Turbine, his Little Rock band, when his band opened for Fugazi in their final show. “We were good, our records were good, we had been reviewed, we’ve played with Fugazi, I thought, ‘Obviously, we’re gonna keep going up,'” says Dickey. “But it didn’t work.”

It was a lesson Dickey would have to relearn time and time again. The Blood Feathers, his Philly band, released three locally acclaimed records and played with bands like the Walkmen and Guided by Voices. He moved on from the group after realizing his goals were different from those of his bandmates. “The truth is, it ain’t easy,"" he says. ""People have kids, big jobs.”

For someone who’s spent most of his adult life in rock bands, Dickey doesn’t view his recent turn toward more roots-based music as any sort of new phase. Ever since he was a teenager, he idolized the acoustic blues of Mississippi John Hurt, and has performed as an acoustic singer-songwriter throughout various stages of his career. “So when the whole Blaze thing happened,” he says, “I was like, ‘Good, I’m prepared for this.'”

Spending time speaking with Dickey, it’s hard not to be struck by how similar his homespun speech patterns and cerebral philosophies are to those of the Foley he portrayed in Hawke’s film. He describes a difficult period in his life after a breakup in his early twenties by saying, “I had the blues proper.” Even Dickey’s reason for why he wasn’t hungry on a recent afternoon in New York sounded like it could have been a Foleyism: “Truth is, I just went to go have bread and butter with some friends at some Frenchy joint in Brooklyn. Beautiful bread. Had to lean on it.”

At the moment, Dickey — who will perform a string of shows at South by Southwest in Austin this week — is ready to move on from his career-establishing film and get back to recording some of the songs he’s been writing. “I have 100-plus songs written down, 40 of which I’m ready to do something about ASAP,” he says. After his stunning turn in Blaze, he’s already begun to receive a slew of audition requests and offers, but for the moment, he’s asked his team to not even show him any screenplays or scripts, for fear he may be tempted.

But even as he thinks about his new album (which includes a cover of Foley’s ""Sitting by the Road”), he can’t escape the pull of the man whose life has permanently changed his own the past few years.

Dickey is talking about his new song “Monstrous Moonshine,” a song, influenced in part by his nephew, that he describes as being about “the hope of someone looking out for you.” As he starts reciting a few of the song’s lyrics, he stops and smiles. “It’s funny,” he says, “because there’s a line in that song: ‘Be the crazy blazing moon. I wrote that in 2015,” he says, two years before he was ever asked to play Blaze Foley in a movie. “Music can do that sometimes.”",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202688.89/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322180106-20190322202106-00188.warc.gz
141,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/blaze-foley-movie-biopic-songwriter-ethan-hawke-718036/,"A quintessential Americana artist before such a thing existed, Blaze Foley's songs were, at various turns, plaintive, hilarious and darkly intense. Merle Haggard, Lyle Lovett and John Prine were among those who recorded his songs, while Lucinda Williams and Townes Van Zandt wrote odes to Foley. And future Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich once reportedly referred to him as his ""own Bob Dylan."" Yet, between two indisputable facts there is little about Foley that hasn't been shrouded in mystery and duct-taped together in mythical fashion. These are the facts: Blaze Foley was born Michael David Fuller in December 1949. Thirty-nine years and two months later, he was shot dead.

The life and legend of Blaze Foley is now being resurrected with Blaze, a new biopic directed by actor and filmmaker Ethan Hawke, who, true to Foley's confounding legend, once believed the singer had died taking a bullet for a homeless man at the unemployment office. The film opens in Nashville this weekend with sold-out screenings that feature Q&As with Hawke, musician-actor Charlie Sexton (who portrays Townes Van Zandt) and lead actor Ben Dickey, who gives an astonishing and heartfelt performance as the witty yet painfully insecure Foley.

Hawke co-wrote Blaze with the singer-songwriter's muse, Sybil Rosen (played onscreen by Arrested Development's Alia Shawkat), and based it on her memoir, Living in the Woods in a Tree: Remembering Blaze Foley. The love affair that blossomed between Foley and Rosen would span ""two years and 10 states,"" she wrote in the book, first published in 2008 by the University of North Texas Press.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMT76_mYDV0

To the entirely uninitiated, Blaze Foley was the man responsible for ""If I Could Only Fly,"" a devastating piece of songwriting that Merle Haggard clearly recognized as such, cutting it as both a duet with Willie Nelson in 1987, and then later as the title track of his remarkable 2000 comeback album. To others, including Rosen, Foley was ""Depty Dawg,"" a nickname he acquired from the members of Buzzards Roost, a bluegrass band from north Georgia, based on his resemblance to the Fifties cartoon character who donned a flat, broad hat. He would also be christened the ""Duct Tape Messiah,"" for the copious amounts of the adhesive material he used to hold together everything from his hats to his shoes, even making an entire suit out of the stuff at one time. Lucinda Williams would allude to his duct-taped shoes and his disparate traits in ""Drunken Angel,"" from 1998's Car Wheels on a Gravel Road, and Townes Van Zandt, a close friend from whom Foley seemed to crib some of his more self-destructive behavior, wrote and recorded ""Blaze's Blues"" for him in the intervening few years between Foley's death and his own in 1997.

Although he was born in Malvern, Arkansas, Michael David Fuller grew up in San Antonio and Georgia and spent his teenage years in Texas, often telling people he was from Marfa in the Lone Star State, perhaps because he longed to be considered a Texas troubadour. His parents were Louise, the daughter of a Pentecostal preacher, and Edwin Fuller, a rambling alcoholic with movie-star looks who left home when Mike was still young. Afflicted with polio as a baby, he was hospitalized and in isolation at just seven months old.

A gifted singer like his older siblings, Doug and Pat, ""Mike"" performed with their mother in a gospel trio, the Singing Fuller Family, joining the act when his brother left home. Later, Pat would be replaced in the group by Mike's younger sister, Marsha. While the trio would perform at various churches, with Louise playing ukulele, Edwin Fuller frequently sat outside in the family station wagon downing bottles of Ripple.

Overweight throughout his adolescence, Fuller began writing true-to-life songs, including his first known composition titled ""Fat Boy."" (Years later, he would often pass a photo of his younger, heavier self through the crowd as he performed the tune). Briefly living with his brother in Arlington, Texas, after earning his GED, he took off to live with relatives in Memphis before landing in northern Georgia, working as roadie for Buzzards Roost, where Mike Fuller would next morph into Depty Dawg. In 1974, he began playing rhythm guitar in the house band at Banning Mill, an alternative arts complex 45 miles west of Atlanta. A converted yarn mill populated by local hippies, actors, musicians and others, it's where in early 1975, he met and fell in love with Rosen, an actress in the mill's theater troupe. Enthralled with his voice and his original songs, which she praised for their honesty and depth, Rosen soon took up with Depty, and for the next nine months the two of them were living – and loving – like hippies in a treehouse built on land owned by his friend Joe Bucher.

Backstage at the Great Southeast Music Hall in Atlanta, the pair met John Prine, but Foley was too shy about his own songwriting to mention it to the seasoned songwriter. He did, however, come away from the venue with a souvenir – an empty Heineken bottle Prine left onstage during the show's intermission. In 2005, Prine's cover of Foley's ""Clay Pigeons,"" appeared on his Grammy-winning Fair and Square LP.

Foley and Rosen ""jumped the broom"" in an unofficial wedding ceremony in 1976 before hitchhiking to New Orleans on their way to Austin, where the bustling live music scene at the outset of the Outlaw movement meant more opportunity yet more competition. Rosen waited tables while Foley wrote songs, but his time in the Texas capital was short-lived and he soon returned to Georgia and Rosen stayed in Austin.

By that time, Fuller/Dawg was also toying with a new stage name, ""Blue Foley,"" inspired in part by country singer and TV star Red Foley, settling eventually on the more romantic-sounding ""Blaze."" Foley and Rosen were still living apart when they hatched a plan to reunite and relocate to Chicago, which was, not coincidentally, Prine's hometown. In the Windy – and bitterly cold – City, Rosen took note of Foley's increasing tendency to self-sabotage his performances, numbing the sting of an inattentive or worse, hostile, crowd with alcohol. Foley soon told her he was returning to Austin, but in March 1977, was back in Chicago, sitting at the foot of her bed to play the song he'd just written: ""If I Could Only Fly."" They would see each other again just once.

Foley eventually met musician and producer Gurf Morlix, who would produce albums for Lucinda Williams, Mary Gauthier and Ray Wylie Hubbard, among others. Together they relocated to Houston, with Foley opening several shows for Morlix throughout the region. As the Urban Cowboy-inspired craze took hold in Texas and beyond, Foley's response was to affix duct tape to the tips of his boots in a gesture mocking the silver tips of the ersatz cowboys emulating the film's star, John Travolta. Foley signed a deal with Zephyr Records, with the release of a 45 of ""If I Could Only Fly,"" which led to a gig in 1980 opening for Kinky Friedman at New York's Lone Star Café.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB_2CUj3y6Y

Rosen, who was appearing in a play in the city, met up with him in the club where he gave her a copy of the single. A few days later, she went back to the Lone Star to watch him perform, but he was so intoxicated she left almost immediately — Friedman fired him that night. Townes Van Zandt was also in town, and his presence in Foley's life coincided, friends would say, with his increasing binge drinking. Foley would return to Austin where —when he wasn't making a spectacle of himself by overindulging in alcohol — he impressed audiences with deft finger-picking guitar skills and rough-hewn vocals.

""There's kind of two Blazes,"" Van Zandt told the Austin American-Statesman in 1989. ""A lot of people saw one or the other. There was the wild one... and then there was the gentle, loving, caring one. I came to know both.""

Van Zandt would also say of his friend, ""He is one of the most spiritual cats I've ever met: an ace picker, a writer who never shirks from the truth; never fails to rhyme; and one of the flashiest wits I've ever had to put up with.""

While forging his own serpentine path to stardom, such as it was during his lifetime, Foley also came to champion and befriend fellow artists including prolific Texas songwriter Kimmie Rhodes, and Pat MacDonald and Barbara K — the couple who performed as Timbuk3 and earned a Top 20 pop hit in 1986 with ""The Future's So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades."" Although 1987 would bring the release of the Willie and Merle duet version of ""If I Could Only Fly,"" the release of the song as a single was hampered by a label shakeup. Still, with his first royalty check from the album release, Foley made an investment – in several rolls of colored duct tape. Although he sobered up for a short period, his rough and rowdy ways continued throughout Austin, getting him barred from nearly every local club, save for the Austin Outhouse, where, at the end of 1988, he would play a two-night gig that was captured on a four-track cassette recorder.

On the night of January 31, 1989, Foley had been drinking and picking fights at the Outhouse, before ending up at the home of his friend, Concho January, in the early hours of the next morning. When January's son, Carey, also known as J.J., showed up, an argument ensued during which he shot Foley with a .22 rifle. Foley was rushed to the hospital, but the bullet had entered his already severely compromised liver and he died on the operating table. Carey January was acquitted of first-degree meditated murder in September 1989.

Foley was buried in a duct-tape-covered coffin in South Austin's Live Oak Cemetery, where his tombstone bears his profile as well as the outline of a guitar with several of his song titles engraved inside. The stone also features these lyrics to his song ""Big Cheeseburgers and Good French Fries"": ""Think I'm crazy, but that depends/ I don't seem that crazy to me.""

Today the Portland, Oregon-based band unveiled “Booksmart Baby,” one of 12 tracks added to the original album’s 13 to round out the upcoming double LP Furr: Deluxe Edition.

Different from the hazy, psychedelic Americana of Furr’s best-known songs like “Black River Killer” and the title track, “Booksmart Baby” is a mellow, finger-picked folk tune that runs for just under two minutes. The song, which first surfaced as a B-side on a 2009 Record Store Day single, sounds in line with the wistful melancholy of Nick Drake and that of another Portland artist, Elliott Smith. Throughout the short song, Blitzen Trapper frontman Eric Early delivers hushed, cryptically poetic lyrics full of longing.

The band will support the expanded reissue with a lengthy cross-country tour, which ends with a two-night hometown stand in November. Each show will feature two sets, the first being a full performance of Furr.

143,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/blue-tacoma-singer-russell-dickerson-on-streaming-success-new-video-627818/,"Country newcomer Russell Dickerson is currently on the road opening for Thomas Rhett, an artist with whom he has much in common: like TR, Dickerson draws on his home life with wife Kailey to write engaging, personal country-pop that reinforces his status as a happily married man.The approach is clearly working for the Tennessee native – his debut hit ""Yours"" has been streamed more than 100 million times across sites like Spotify and YouTube. Dickerson called in from a concert stop on Rhett's Home Team Tour in Lafayette, Louisiana, to talk about his early streaming success, his creative partnership with his wife and the cinematic new video for his latest love song, ""Blue Tacoma.""""Blue Tacoma"" has been on the streaming sites since January 2016 and streamed more than 54 million times on Spotify alone. How has streaming changed the timeline of when a new artist can reach an audience?As a new artist in this climate, there's so many outlets. If you look at hip-hop, there's so many big rappers, like Instagram-famous rappers or on Soundcloud — there's so many outlets to find music now, and it's blowing up on all these platforms. For me, Spotify was that platform. [Their country programmer] John Marks believed in me. It's a credit to the reaction of the fans, too. This song stayed on Spotify playlists and kept growing and growing. They were just like, ""We can't take it down because it's working so well."" That’s why, I think, it's been such a big explosion in the digital world.What's the story behind the song? Does it come from a specific memory you have with  your wife Kailey?The part about the Tacoma was taken from one of my co-writers. The guy she was dating at the time just got a new Tacoma, so we were just vibing on how cool it would be to take a road trip in California. It started out hypothetical. Then Kailey and I went out to California for her brother's wedding, and we literally drove from L.A. all the way up to Big Sur, which is like a five-hour trip up and down the coast. We got to live out what I was singing about in that song, so I came back and we rewrote the song to get the feeling of that specific California road trip. I redid the melody to capture what it felt like to be in that moment being in awe of that beautiful scenery along the California coast. We plugged in new lyrics on the verse and changed the hook. It wasn't even called ""Blue Tacoma"" before. It was called ""Heaven Right Here.""The splashy video for ""Blue Tacoma"" has these grand, sweeping shots of the California coast. Kailey is your co-star in the clip, as she was in the ""Yours"" video, which she directed. Do you collaborate on all your videos?The ""Blue Tacoma"" video is kind of our last hurrah. Now that it's growing out of our control, we wanted to do one more video together. I wanted it to be this very intimate road trip. I wanted it to feel like it was just Kailey and me together in the entire world. Her brother, Toben Seymour, who's done videos for Kanye West and Black Eyed Peas and tons of people, he came in and helped us get all those shots with the drones. He helped us a lot. I just really wanted that intimate feel. I think it was just captured beautifully.You say it's growing out of your control. What do you mean by that?We started out just the two of us, and my manager and agent. But aside from that small team, Kailey did everything visual. She took all the photos and shot the video of my shows. It was just the two of us creating content and the graphics for how to present the music for the world to see. Now there's so many people on our team. We just kind of have to let go in little ways. We still have creative control, but they're just running with it.There are a lot of new male artists looking to make a name for themselves in country music – how do you distinguish yourself from the pack?I've realized that I'm one of the pioneers of artists presenting a positive outlook on marriage. Some artists try to appear as single as possible, and I feel like I'm the opposite. I'm one of the guys saying, ""Hey, marriage is amazing. Check out my Instagram. See how great it is to share this life with someone."" I think that's a thing that sets me apart. And then second is just me being myself — just being goofy and just being so energetic onstage. I think word of that is spreading among country fans. I think it's working. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202324.5/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320085116-20190320111116-00381.warc.gz
144,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/bluegrass-master-del-mccoury-previews-delfest-talks-dierks-bentley-118527/,"Since the pollen descended in early spring, Del McCoury's allergies have scratched up his alert high tenor voice, recently forcing the bluegrass master to curtail appearances in North Carolina and Texas. But with quarts of honey and lemon in reserve, he'll be stretching for every lead and harmony at his very own DelFest this Memorial Day weekend in Western Maryland (May 25th - 28th), where he'll welcome stars such as Dierks Bentley, the Trey Anastasio Band, Chris Thile, Bela Fleck, Gov't Mule, and Marty Stuart for one of the summer season's biggest stops on the bluegrass, roots and jam-band circuit. It's also something of a homecoming for McCoury, who came of age playing in the music-hungry clubs of nearby Baltimore.The allergies crept up in April during a run of shows with mandolinist David Grisman, whom he met in bluegrass circles back in the early 1960s. ""We started getting something at the same time,"" explains McCoury. ""The first night we were okay but the second night, we had to change keys and do a whole bunch of stuff."" Since then, the graduate of bluegrass father Bill Monroe's band has tried to save himself for the demands of hosting his festival, which pulls back the curtains for the 10th time at the Allegheny County Fairgrounds on the banks of the Potomac River.Before it's all over, tens of thousands of fans will have unfolded lawn chairs to get a look at jam band Leftover Salmon performing Neil Young's classic Harvest, Billy Strings uncorking his unholy guitar runs, the Gibson Brothers serving up their new bluegrass album In the Ground, and mandolinist Chris Thile down from Minnesota after tying up his first season hosting public radio's A Prairie Home Companion. And who knows? With both Thile and Sara Watkins in the house, perhaps there could be two-thirds of a Nickel Creek reunion.""The festival's very laid back and takes on Del's personality,"" says Eric Gibson of the Gibson Brothers, on hand for his third DelFest. ""I have images of him riding around on a golf cart and everybody just saying, 'There's Del! There's Del!' And he's waving to them with his eyes barely open and that beautiful smile he has and that beautiful hair blowing in the wind."" Gibson hopes his bus won't leave the fairgrounds before his hero Marty Stuart takes the stage and can't wait to see mandolin phenomenon Sierra Hull, who makes one of her quieter stops after playing everywhere from the Grand Ole Opry to Carnegie Hall.McCoury hit the stage for the first time in his twenties, checking off every bluegrass club in Baltimore, which he could easily get to from York County, Pennsylvania, his home in the early 1960s. It was the heyday of bluegrass and country in Baltimore when immigrants from the South poured into town for plentiful manufacturing jobs and yearned for the sounds that could carry their minds back home. Inevitably, says McCoury, the booze started flowing in those clubs as easily as the banjo licks and out came the fists, knives and guns. ""I was playing the Stonewall Inn, and they had this oval bar and the bandstand was at one end of the oval. So, I heard something go, 'Pop!' It sounded like a pistol to me and I looked and I saw a guy duck behind the bar at the other end. This other guy, he was standing upright and when this guy would pop his head up, he'd shoot his pistol at him. He never did hit him. Those guys were nuts. We just stood there and played the whole time.""Then one night in 1963, like a scene from a Hollywood musical, the great Bill Monroe walked in unannounced off the slick streets of Baltimore and hired McCoury to play banjo in the Bluegrass Boys. Soon, the young man would take guitar playing and lead vocal chores and enjoy a stage like no other. He only stayed a year with Monroe, but it was long enough to learn that even bluegrass kings lose their voice in the fickle birth of spring. One trip through the deep South, Monroe's bass player Bessi Lee Mauldin informed McCoury that he'd have to take over lead vocal duties for the night. ""So I sang some of the Bill Monroe songs that I knew, and when we came off the stage, I'm standing there close to Bill and he ain't speaking because he can't,"" McCoury says. ""And this gentleman walks out to me, and he stuck his hand out. He said, 'Mr. Monroe, I want to congratulate you on your singing.' And Bill's standing right beside me. He thought the singer must be Bill Monroe. I felt like apologizing to Bill, but I figured there's nothing I can say that's going to help that situation.""Ahead of his performances at DelFest, McCoury spoke to Rolling Stone Country, sharing memories of some of his 2017 headliners from over the years.Dierks Bentley ""The first time I met Dierks, I was playing Telluride and my fiddle player Jason Carter said, 'Hey, I'm going to ride back to Nashville with Dierks.' And I said, 'Who's that?' He said, 'I play with Dierks on Broadway a lot in Nashville.' So I met Dierks, and he had a big old Dually truck and that's what they were riding in. I think the cops stopped him in Arkansas and searched the truck because it was two young guys in a Dually truck. They figured these guys are probably smoking. But they were clean. They didn't have any dope on them. Then Dierks and Jason wrote a song on the way home from Telluride. And when he did a record he recorded a song I wrote, and then he wanted me to help him record it in the studio, and that's how I got more acquainted with him.""Trey Anastasio""His band Phish recorded a song that I wrote. They put it on a live record. They called my booking agent or manager and wondered if I'd bring my band to come and play their festival in Oswego, New York. We went up and played and when we got there, Trey said, 'What can we do together on stage, and I thought, 'Oh…with this rock band, I don't know what we can do together.' He said, 'Do you know 'Blue and Lonesome'? [""I'm Blue, I'm Lonesome""]. And I thought, I wonder if he's thinking about the same 'Blue and Lonesome' that I'm thinking about. I don't think a rock band would do that song. I said, 'Are you talking about the one that Bill Monroe and Hank Williams wrote?' 'Yeah, that's the one.' And I thought, 'This guy knows hardcore bluegrass if he knows that song.' So we went out there and sang it and he knew the whole thing. That's how I acquainted with Trey. He's a great guy."" Gov't Mule ""What is his name, Warren Haynes? Well, we played a show with them along with a band from Florida, I can't remember the name. So we went out there and played that show with him and we did some songs. Right after that, my booking agent booked him at DelFest, this is one of the first or second years. So he played it. He came and he did acoustic. I must have gone out there and sung something with him. I got acquainted with his dad and his dad was a big bluegrass fan and he knew Red Smiley and Don Reno and those guys who came from around Asheville, North Carolina, so we had a lot to talk about. His dad's more my age. Warren's a lot younger than me.""Chris Thile ""I tell you the first time I saw Chris. Me and David Grisman were playing at Grass Valley in California, and I was sitting talking to somebody and David comes over and says, 'I want you to come over here and listen to this little guy play the mandolin. I said, 'Not another mandolin.' But he talked me into it and I went over there and this little kid was there with a bunch of other little kids playing, and David said, 'Now Chris, I'm going to play you this run.' So he played a big long run on his mandolin and then Chris studied for a minute and he played that whole thing. He remembered it just by watching David play that long run and he was only about nine playing that mandolin. You wouldn't believe how that kid was playing.""Marty Stuart ""Marty had his own TV show here in Nashville, and I played it maybe three or four times. Me and Marty did the guitar and the mandolin and did gospel numbers, duets. I've known Marty since he joined Lester Flatt. He was just a boy then. He was just a little guy. We've been great friends ever since, and we'll play music together when we play a date.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205163.72/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326115319-20190326141319-00335.warc.gz

147,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/bluer-than-blue-singer-michael-johnson-dead-at-72-195962/,"Singer-songwriter and accomplished classical guitarist Michael Johnson, whose mellow voice and thoughtful material earned him two Number One singles on the country chart, ""Give Me Wings"" and ""The Moon Is Still Over Her Shoulder,"" and a trio of laid-back Top 40 pop hits, including ""Bluer Than Blue,"" died Tuesday at his home in Minneapolis following a lengthy illness, according to a statement on his website. He was 72. Johnson was born in Alamosa,  Colorado, in 1944 and raised in Denver. Stricken with a severe case of pneumonia at 13, Johnson recuperated at home alongside his older brother, Paul, who had been badly injured in a car accident around the same time. The two taught themselves guitar and, by the end of the year, booked their first gig at the local VFW hall. Johnson would leave college early after winning a talent contest in which first prize included an Epic Records recording contract. A single, ""Hills,"" penned by Johnson, was unsuccessful but led to a string of appearances at a Chicago pub. In 1966, he studied classical guitar in Barcelona,  Spain, at the invitation of master guitarist Andrés Segovia, after which he returned to the U.S. to join New Society, a group founded by New Christy Minstrels founder Randy Sparks. He then became a member of the trio Denver, Boise and Johnson, co-writing songs with fellow member John Denver.Prior to signing with Atlantic Records in 1971, Johnson acted in the off-Broadway musical revue Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris. After a trio of LPs, he teamed in Nashville with producers Brent Maher (The Judds) and Steve Gibson (Lynn Anderson) to record the ballad ""Bluer Than Blue"" for EMI America. The single, penned by Randy Goodrum, reached Number 12 on the pop chart and topped the Adult Contemporary (Easy Listening) chart for three weeks. The accompanying music video for that single was among the first 20 to air on MTV in 1981. The follow-up, a cover of the show tune ""Almost Like Being in Love"" was also a Top 40 hit, and 1979's ""This Night Won't Last Forever"" reached the Top 20. Beginning in 1985, Johnson placed a string of hits on the country chart, including two Number Ones. Other Top Tens (on the RCA label) included ""I Love You By Heart"" (a duet with then-labelmate Sylvia), ""Crying Shame,"" ""I Will Whisper Your Name"" and ""That's That."" His 1995 single ""Cain's Blood"" was a Top 30 single a year earlier for the group 4 Runner.Legendary personal manager Phil Kaufman, a longtime friend of Johnson's, remembers him as a skilled musician and entertainer, telling Rolling Stone Country, ""He was not just a great guitar player but he had a great stage presence as well. He would do these little riffs that guitar players would kill for.""Johnson toured extensively, including with Wynonna, Clint Black and Alison Krauss and Union Station. He and Krauss recorded the 1997 duet ""Whenever I Call You Friend."" He continued to release albums on various labels through 2012's Moonlit Déjà Vu, an LP recorded with his daughter, Truly Carmichael. In 2007, the singer underwent quadruple bypass heart surgery.

148,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/bob-seger-kid-rock-nashville-final-tour-review-778294/,"Bob Seger summed up the staying power of a 50-plus-year career by the second song of his Nashville concert on Friday night: ""Still the Same."" The 1978 single was the de facto theme of what the Michigan rocker has dubbed his Travelin' Man Final Tour, as Seger delivered a 22-song set of classics and deeper cuts with a workingman's conviction and ethic. At 73, he remains a vibrant elder statesman of rock & roll.

Bolstered by a remarkable 14-member Silver Bullet Band, including the venerable Alto Reed on saxophone and Nashville aces Rob McNelley, Greg Morrow and Jim ""Moose"" Brown, Seger was in superb voice and showed no lingering effects of a recent back surgery that threatened to prematurely end his touring career. Instead, he moved about the stage with ease, pumping his fists and clapping along to up-tempo staples like ""The Fire Down Below"" and ""Her Strut."" The latter was particularly freewheeling, with Seger having some fun with the lyrical conjunction, swapping out ""but"" for an intentionally tongue-twisting option: ""they do respect her — however — they love to watch her strut,"" he sang. Such dad humor and gestures endeared Seger to the graying boomer fans who made up the bulk of the audience.

But while burners like ""Old Time Rock & Roll,"" the potent one-two punch of ""Travelin' Man/Beautiful Loser"" and a marvelous ""Ramblin' Gamblin' Man"" ratcheted up the energy in the Bridgestone Arena, it was the ballads that best highlighted Seger's status as an American troubadour. ""Like a Rock,"" inspired by his teenage years as a cross-country runner, was appropriately nostalgic, ""Against the Wind"" still poignantly addressed the cruel passage of time and ""Turn the Page"" evoked the isolation and loneliness of those who live and work far from some semblance of home.

Seger also took time to weave in a cover of Bob Dylan's ""Forever Young,"" paying tribute, complete with projected archival photos, to late stars like Tom Petty, B.B. King and Glenn Frey.

At the midpoint of a four-song encore, ""Night Moves"" appeared to work its unfailing magic, before Seger welcomed fellow Detroit son — and current Nashville resident — Kid Rock for a show-closing ""Rock and Roll Never Forgets.""

""He's one of the best singer-songwriters in American history,"" he said of Seger, before following his host's lead and dancing his way through the 1977 anthem. ""It may be his last time in Nashville,"" Rock said, ""but I sure hope not.""

151,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/bonnaroo-2014s-greatest-country-music-moments-100186/,"Despite its standing as one of America&apos;s most sonically diverse music festivals, on paper, Bonnaroo&apos;s lineup is generally pretty light on country, despite the fact that Old Crow Medicine Show actually performed the festival&apos;s opening set when it launched in 2002.
Bonnaroo 2014: Rolling Stone&apos;s Best Live and Backstage Photos
Bonnaroo has a long history of booking traditional country legacy acts like Dwight Yoakam, Kris Kristofferson, Emmylou Harris, Merle Haggard and Kenny Rogers — along with jam-band-fest-friendly bluegrass and roots artists. But Miranda Lambert, Kacey Musgraves, Zac Brown Band and Dierks Bentley are the only mainstream contemporary country entities who&apos;ve ever made the Bonnaroo marquee.
""Country is represented with an asterisk,"" Eric Church recently told Rolling Stone. ""We have to perform collaborations. We have to perform a tribute. We can&apos;t perform by ourselves. Country music right now is the most popular American format.""
Certainly Church&apos;s comments apply to the country&apos;s major music festivals like Lollapalooza and Coachella, which, despite the genre&apos;s commercial dominance, seldom book country stars. But Bonnaroo — which happens on a farm about an hour outside of Nashville — boasts a broader palette than its contemporaries. And yet, country at Bonnaroo is still country with an asterisk. Bentley, Bonnaroo&apos;s lone between-the-margins mainstream country singer (who did play his own Bonnaroo set in 2007), returned to the festival this year, but only as guest on actor/comedian/musician Ed Helms&apos; Bluegrass Situation Superjam.
But that doesn&apos;t mean Bonnaroo wasn&apos;t without its country moments this past weekend. You&apos;ve probably already heard about Kanye West, Elton John and even Dierks, so here are some of the festival&apos;s twangier highlights you may have missed. (Keep in mind, though, most Bonnaroovians would probably never think to call these artists ""country,"" but rather categorize them under more cool-factor-friendly orders like folk, bluegrass, singer-songwriter, roots-rock or Americana.)
Somewhat unsurprisingly, a couple of Bonnaroo&apos;s biggest country moments came courtesy of Jack White, who headlined Saturday night with a triumphant, icon-status-reinforcing, three-hour set. ""Tennessee, I know you!"" the Volunteer State transplant told the crowd minutes into the show. And he embraced performing in his adopted home state, paying tribute to the Tennessee troubadours that came before him, dedicating the last verse of the White Stripes&apos; chestnut ""I&apos;m Slowly Turning Into You"" to George Jones, Elvis Presley, Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton.
If White is indeed morphing into his Tennessee forbearers, the effect was clear on performances of the Stripes staples ""Hotel Yorba"" and ""We&apos;re Going to Be Friends."" The former has gone from distorted garage-rock stomper to full-on pickin&apos; party in the hands of White&apos;s ace backing band — which includes Nashville cats the likes of mad-scientist multi-instumentalists Fats Kaplin and Cory Younts, and fiddle player  Lillie Mae Rische — while the latter was augmented into a steel guitar-heavy barroom weeper. Add in an electrifying version of White&apos;s recent Appalachian folk-rocker ""Temporary Ground"" and you have more traditional country sounds than most main-stage sets at CMA Fest.
Several hours before White took Bonnaroo&apos;s What Stage, more than a hundred yards across the 100,000-plus capacity field, on the tiny, wedding-tent-like ""Café Where?"" side stage, Sam Hunt made his Bonnaroo debut. Dressed head to toe in white, the towering college football player-turned-Music Row songwriter had a strong clique of country fans singing along to his Keith Urban cut, ""Cop Car."" It wasn&apos;t the only song familiar to some in the crowd, as Hunt peppered his hip-hop-beats and alt-rock-guitar-infused pop country with snippets of radio hits like Fall Out Boy&apos;s ""Sugar, We&apos;re Going Down"" and Montel Jordan&apos;s ""This Is how We Do It.""
Trucks and red Solo cups were probably far from the minds of the thousands of festivalgoers singing along to Ben Howard&apos;s banjo-, cello- and mandolin-powered, Mumford and Sons-indebted, heart-on-sleeve anthems during the rising indie-folkie&apos;s Friday afternoon appearance on the Which Stage. And festivalgoers who caught Birmingham, Alabama newcomer country duo John and Jacob later that day, at the New Music On Tap Lounge, might have been reminded of radio-friendly, mid-Nineties pop-rock like the Gin Blossoms or the Rembrandts (Yes, the Friends theme band!), when an Everly Brothers comparison is just as apt. A more rockin&apos; outfit live than on record, the band&apos;s jangly, British Invasion-inspired ditty ""Be My Girl"" could have easily been a killer Dwight Yoakam cut.
Getting a festival crowd to roar at the sounds of an upright bass is quite a feat, and one that came naturally to the Wood Brothers, who returned to Bonnaroo. Appearing at This Tent, the (mostly) acoustic, minimalist Americana trio bound spells with set highlights like a coffee-house-quiet cover of Los Lobos&apos; ""I Got Loaded"" and the title track from their 2013 LP The Muse.
Just around the bend, on the Sonic Stage, Greensky Bluegrass participated in a live Q&A/performance session. A particular highlight was the group trading solos and taking melodic liberties on a delicate-to-urgent rendition of Bruce Springsteen&apos;s Nebraska classic ""Atlantic City"" — a song that&apos;s essentially a modern-folk/Americana standard at this point.  ""Bluegrass festivals are just like this,"" singer-mandolin player Paul Hoffman told the crowd.
Not all of Bonnaroo&apos;s roots-y performers were so pensive, though. Bandana-donning, bearded and be-mutton-chopped Atlanta longhairs Blackberry Smoke cranked up their saloon-piano-driven Southern rock Saturday afternoon on the Which Stage. In the same space where 40,000-plus 20-somethings raved hard to the dubstep sounds of Skrillex a mere 12 hours earlier, hoards of sprawled-out sun-bathers, hula-hooping hippies, shirtless noodle dancing bros and at least one person proudly flying a giant Canadian flag with a weed leaf on it, loved on the band as they busted out guitarmonized riff-rockers like ""Everybody Knows She&apos;s Mine"" and ""Up in Smoke"". The latter — a song that, complete with a truck-commercial-ready monster chorus, rife with references to girls in skin-tight britches, redneck backbeats and hillbilly hoedowns — would just as easily fit in between Blake Shelton and Hank Williams Jr. spins on country radio as it did at Bonnaroo. But while the current country standard is to celebrate small-town living, Blackberry Smoke sings about small-town trappings on the soulful country blues ""One Horse Town"" — a Springsteen-esque set highlight that clearly resonated across a crowd of people who were in their own world on a farm in rural Tennessee.
Getting even grittier on the country rock front, standing in the That Tent audience late Sunday afternoon, (where you could spot Dierks Bentley getting in some Father&apos;s Day time with his kids), watching Shovels and Rope felt like an act of voyeurism. Facing each other on a small riser at the front of the stage, the Southern gothic husband-and-wife garage-folk duo of guitarist-singer Michael Trent and drummer-singer Cary Ann Hearst dripped with sweat, sexual tension and almost unbearable suspense as they fiendishly locked eyes and harmonized on the menacing mellow-drama ""Shank Hill St."" like they were the only two people on the planet. Release came with the set-closing, savage, blues-rock stomper ""Hail, Hail.""
While that was a little too dirty and distorted to count as a bluegrass moment, it happened on Ed Helms&apos; Bluegrass Situation stage, where neo-traditionalist, multi-instrumentalist Sarah Jarosz and a two-piece, strings-only backing band serenaded a hangover-nursing crowd with moody originals like ""Tell Me True"" and covers like the old-timey John Harford instrumental, ""The Squirrel Hunters."" By sets end, Jarosz and company had the crowd up on their feet singing along to a wistful, playful take on Tom Waits&apos; ""Come on Up to the House,"" her full-bodied, butter-dripping voice resonating in sharp contrast to Waits&apos; iconic gravel gargle. In a cruel scheduling move, Jarosz&apos; set completely overlapped with longtime Bonnaroo vets Yonder Mountain String band — with always welcome special guest pickers Sam Bush and John Frazier — who were meanwhile leading tens of thousands in a grassified sing-along of Bob Marley&apos;s ""One Love"" on the What Stage.
Jarosz and Yonder Mountain&apos;s Dave Johnston would appear together later that night — along with Robert Ellis, the Black Lillies, Lake Street Drive, the Lone Bellow, session guitarist extraordinaire Bryan Sutton and others — at Ed Helms&apos; Bluegrass Situation Superjam. True to both bluegrass and Bonnaroo traditions, the show thrived on musical cross-pollination, Helms and friends putting old-timey touches on classic country and pop gold like ""Angel From Montgomery,"" ""Islands in the Stream"" (""One of the greatest country tunes of all-time!"" according to Helms), Gnarls Barkley&apos;s ""Crazy"" (which pretty much describes the crowd&apos;s reaction) and Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes&apos; ""(I&apos;ve Had) The Time of My Life,"" which made one helluva prelude for Sir Elton John, who was just beginning his festival-closing set on the What Stage.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202433.77/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320150106-20190320172106-00142.warc.gz

153,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/boom-chicka-boom-246196/,"Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson are about as familiar as the faces on Mount Rushmore, and it&apos;s easy to assume that they are equally frozen in time, equally nonthreatening. They organize benefits, sing for presidents, even pitch products on occasion. But in decades past, they were the bad boys, the self-described ""outlaws"" who introduced a bold frankness to country songwriting and declared their independence from tired-and-untrue Music Row formulas, shaking the Nashville establishment to its roots. New traditionalists like Steve Earle and Dwight Yoakam — not to mention a renegade son like Hank Williams Jr. — are celebrated for their menacing attitudes and rock & rolling sound, but these grand old men invented contemporary country cool.
Recorded shortly after Elvis Presley&apos;s famed sessions at 706 Union Avenue, in Memphis, the eighteen songs collected on Johnny Cash: The Sun Years are taut, grimly elegant tales of a world where ""just around the corner there&apos;s heartache."" Elvis&apos;s rockabilly was expansive and free; Cash injected a bleaker strain of country history into rock — brooding, constricted, tense, stoic. Cash&apos;s songs are drenched in fatalism. ""I don&apos;t like it, but I guess things happen that way,"" Cash sings without a shred of self-pity. In ""Folsom Prison Blues,"" he acknowledges from his cell that ""I know I can&apos;t be free"" but offers no apologies. The precise, detailed imagery of masterpieces like ""Big River"" and ""I Walk the Line,"" matched by the stark guitar-and-bass accompaniment of the Tennessee Two, still astonishes thirty-five years later. The influence of these recordings cannot be overestimated — they are the songs to which John Cougar Mellencamp and Bruce Springsteen still aspire today.
The only ominous note on The Sun Years is struck in Cash&apos;s 1958 smash ""Ballad of a Teenage Queen,"" when producer Jack Clement mars Cash&apos;s arrangement with a screeching soprano, superfluous instrumentation and a lame backup chorus. It proved the harbinger of the many overproduced Johnny Cash records to come.
Happily, on his latest album, Boom Chicka Boom, Cash returns to a sparer lineup. Named for the trademark guitar rhythm of Luther Perkins, the late Tennessee Two guitarist, Boom Chicka Boom reflects a mellower Cash who has no illusions about the world but seems to have reached an uneasy peace with it. He still sings of hard-luck stories and unhappy endings, but his somber tone is softened by a sense of life&apos;s absurdity. ""Harley"" — about a hapless factory worker who gets rich quick — takes an ironic turn when the title character&apos;s wife gives ""all of Harley&apos;s hard-earned money to the Lord/Harley started drinking, wound up in Betty Ford."" The good-humored folksiness in songs like ""Farmer&apos;s Almanac"" sounds like a more mature version of The Sun Years&apos; defiant resignation. Unfortunately, not all of the material on Boom is firstrate; the biggest disappointment is the inappropriately stylized, self-consciously enigmatic ""Hidden Shame,"" written by Elvis Costello.
Cash&apos;s rumbling voice hardly seems to have aged, and on Boom Chicka Boom the singer has learned to accept, and even laugh about, adversity. If this album is nowhere near as monumental as The Sun Years, it&apos;s still a vivid personal statement expressive of Cash&apos;s experiences and the distance he has traveled in his life.
Less intimate than Boom Chicka Boom but more consistent is Highwayman 2, a sequel to the million-selling 1985 summit that brought Cash together with Nelson, Jennings and Kristofferson. The material these legends have chosen to perform — they wrote six of the ten songs themselves — is predictably generic and mythologizing, focusing on road songs, trains and manly self-reliance.
The familiar themes and glossy production may be a bit anonymous, but hearing Waylon and Willie trade verses on ""Born and Raised in Black and White"" — the story of two brothers, one an outlaw, the other, needless to say, a priest — is still thrilling. Nelson&apos;s two original contributions, ""Two Stories Wide"" and ""Texas,"" are simple and effective, adding a note of vulnerability to this often larger-than-life collection.
""Songs That Made a Difference,"" which Cash wrote, invokes Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and Roy Orbison in a wistful look back at the days when rock was discovering Nashville just as these stars were turning tail and fleeing. Intentionally or not, ""Songs"" leads into Kristofferson&apos;s ""Living Legend,"" whose first line is ""Was it better then, with our backs against the wall?"" It&apos;s a small reminder of how the outlaws bravely followed their convictions and risked their commercial future in the name of artistic freedom.
Kristofferson certainly still prides himself on such a rebel stance. Unfortunately, Third World Warrior is a textbook example of good intentions gone awry. Kristofferson&apos;s statement on the U.S. involvement in Central America, the album is about as subtle as a Salvadoran death squad. Titles like ""The Eagle and the Bear"" and ""Sandinista"" sadly tell too much of the story. Images recur throughout Third World Warrior — soldiers killing babies, the invincibility of the human spirit — but none we haven&apos;t encountered before. Minimal, instantly forgettable melodies further bury the empty sloganeering.
Cash&apos;s records from the Fifties offer a worldview that remains compelling, while Kristofferson has fallen victim to simplistic finger pointing. Yet Kristofferson could attempt such an ambitious, intensely personal project only because of the battles he fought and won years ago alongside his buddies. The honesty and directness of these four artists changed country music forever. In ""American Remains,"" the Highwaymen sing of farmers, gamblers and Native Americans, but of course they also sing of themselves and the dusty road they still travel. ""We are heroes of the homeland,"" they harmonize. ""And we&apos;ll ride again.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202589.68/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322014319-20190322040319-00201.warc.gz
154,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/bottle-rockets-new-song-highway-70-blues-721869/,"For hardworking bands like the Bottle Rockets, getting to the next gig often means fighting through one of life’s universal miseries: traffic. The group laments a strangled stretch of interstate on their new song, “Highway 70 Blues,” which makes its premiere on Rolling Stone Country today. The tune is the second to surface from the Midwestern roots rockers' upcoming album Bit Logic, which will be released on October 12th.

Throughout “Highway 70 Blues,” band frontman Brian Henneman sings with wry humor about the stress of staring at a sea of brake lights, particularly referencing I-70, a main artery into his band’s home city of St. Louis: “Well I’ve driven all across this land, and I’ve come to understand, that if you’re in a hurry to cross Missouri, things might not go as planned.”

According to Henneman, the lyrics are as honest as they sound, written mostly in his head on a trip home from Omaha. “Like most things I write, it's pretty much just a police report of the incident,” he says.

While the song is full of observations noticed with a foot on the brake, musically it chugs along at a spry pace with twangy electric roadhouse riffs. Sonically, it’s right in line with the sound the band helped pioneer nearly three decades ago, when they formed alongside alt-country contemporaries like Uncle Tupelo.

After performing at this week’s AmericanaFest in Nashville, the band will support Bit Logic, their 13th album, with a slate of tour dates in October and November.

In their harmony-heavy rendition, Baker begins the 1999 Dixie Chicks classic, singing the first verse while playing mandolin, while Dacus and Bridgers (on guitar) trade off on the song's second verse. Complete with an impressive violin solo by Camille Falkner, ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" is the most explicitly rootsy offering to date from the trio of folk/indie-leaning singer-songwriters and follows a recent Dixie Chicks cover by fellow indie rocker Soccer Mommy.

The trio is currently in the midst of a U.S. theater tour after releasing their debut collaborative EP earlier this fall. Their current show is a four-hour marathon evening of music, with complete solo sets from Dacus, Bridgers and Baker that culminates in a full-band boygenius performance.

According to card prior to the video, the country singer-guitarist asked his fans to submit videos of their breakups, leading to a mish-mosh of seemingly real and clearly staged cellphone clips. Paisley intersperses the fan-filmed footage with video of various rodeo events — bulls, broncs and sheep — and from a surprise concert he threw at a Nashville honky-tonk Tootsies Orchid Lounge late last year.

Despite all the romantic tumult, ""Bucked Off"" maintains the cheeky humor for which Paisley's videos have become known. At one point, as Paisley holds a cellphone, the most ominous of text messages is displayed onscreen: ""I know you are at a concert right now but we need to talk.""

Paisley, who has become a regular fixture in Nationwide TV commercials, co-wrote ""Bucked Off,"" his first single since 2017's ""Heaven South,"" with Chris DuBois and Kelly Lovelace. The lyrics name-check George Strait and his song ""The Cowboy Rides Away,"" as the narrator struggles to hang on to a rocky relationship.

158,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/brad-paisley-charlie-daniels-talk-up-the-miracle-on-music-row-72354/,"Nine-year-old Audrey Stanger can&apos;t play guitar. But she was given one — signed by Charlie Daniels, no less — on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry Tuesday night.

Stanger, who counts herself as a country music fan with Taylor Swift at the top of her list, has been a patient at St. Jude Children&apos;s Research Hospital in Memphis for three years. Last Tuesday she had surgery for removal of a small inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. This Tuesday she was a guest announcer on the world&apos;s longest-running radio show.
Stanger&apos;s appearance and new guitar were part of a special 25th anniversary of Country Cares for St. Jude Kids show. A sold-out Opry audience heard the Charlie Daniels Band, Jonathan Jackson and Sam Palladio from ABC&apos;s Nashville (which premieres tonight for its third season), Bill Anderson, Brad Paisley and many others perform and talk about their connection to the charity. A portion of ticket proceeds was donated to Country Cares for St. Jude Kids. During the show, images from Country Cares&apos; first 25 years were shown on the Opry barn screen.
Paisley was introduced to the program, founded in 1989, by its creator, Alabama&apos;s Randy Owen. ""He is to be credited for his perception of country music as benevolent, music with heart,"" Paisley said. ""He is the reason for our good name.""
Daniels agrees, suggesting that Owen should be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to bring country stars — new and established — to help raise funds for and awareness of St. Jude. The stars visit the hospital, and, with no exceptions, say one of the differences between it and other facilities is that it has an optimistic and hopeful energy. ""Kids don&apos;t stop being kids because they are sick,"" says Paisley, who has seen kids riding trikes in the hallways. Walls are brightly colored, and patients take part in arts and crafts and other activities along with their treatment.
To date the partnership has raised $500 million, and Owen says he hopes he ""lives to see $1 billion."" He calls the partnership ""the Miracle on Music Row."" Owen, who started the program after meeting hospital founder Danny Thomas, declined to say who he sees filling his shoes with the philanthropy, but concedes he has some names in mind, and is watching them to see who has ""the heart, honesty and integrity and the willingness. So many people give money and walk away. The important thing for something like this is to give money and don&apos;t walk away.""
The money raised helps fund the hospital&apos;s mission to provide care to every child in need, regardless of ability to pay. That includes associated expenses, not just medical care. For example, says Stanger&apos;s mother Lynn, the hospital pays to fly her and her daughter from their home in East Tennessee or reimburse her for gas for the 8-hour (each way) drive. As its name suggests, the hospital also does research to find cures, and the laboratories and science are part of what Daniels finds so inspiring about the place.
But the partnership is not just about the money; it is about the awareness that only country stars can deliver. Fundraisers run on hundreds of radio stations across the country reinforce the awareness message with an opportunity to give.
""The awareness is so important. After learning what they do, I don&apos;t see how people can&apos;t give,"" Daniels says.
""The amazing thing about St. Jude is, in a world that is so focused on ourselves, they are focused on helping kids no matter what world they are born into,"" adds Eric Paslay, another of the night&apos;s performers. ""When you support St. Jude, it means you are helping kids that could help cure you someday, sing for you and be your neighbor.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202635.43/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322054710-20190322080710-00066.warc.gz

The performance marked the first installment in Kimmel&apos;s latest ""Mash Up Monday"" series, and the artists were aptly renamed ""Color Me Bradd"" for the occasion. Their powers blended easily together, with Color Me Badd frontman Bryan Abrams&apos; vocals soaring over Paisley&apos;s astonishing assortment of guitar tricks.
With backup singers Mark Calderon and Sam Watters dutifully ""ooh ohh ohh""-ing and bounding across the stage, Paisley traded lyrics with Abrams and delivered the song&apos;s sultry spoken word bridge with an earnest Southern drawl. Fittingly, Paisley returned to his trusted wah-wah pedal to close out the song, flying up and down the fretboard alongside Abrams&apos; final vocal run.
Kimmel has yet to announce any other pairings for the rest of November&apos;s ""Mash Up Monday"" performances.

After singing the tuneful, low-key first verse while accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, Paisley tossed the instrument off to his left and switched to an electric as his band dug into the chugging paean to different points of view, which the singer punctuated with a fiery solo.

You might say it was like shooting fish in a barrel. And if you&apos;re comic Jon Reep, you ask why you&apos;d be shooting fish in a barrel in the first place (as he says, just think of the mess).

Paisley himself selected several of the acts for the mostly-clean Thursday night showcase at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center. Although it&apos;s where locals usually watch an opera or Broadway revival, on this night the stage turned into a black-curtained, bare-bones platform.
Rather than prepare a full stand-up comedy set to kick off the night, Paisley strummed a few novelty songs that he swears he&apos;ll never record or sing on the Opry.
One such title? ""You&apos;ll Always Be My First (Cousin)."" Another was named ""Bleep It Out.""
While he also bantered with each comedian, for the most part he let the spotlight shine on his guests: Reep, Nate Bargatze, Keith Alberstadt, Sarah Tiana, Theo Von and Greg Hahn. There were a few awkward sex jokes — this was a comedy show after all — but most of the humor was of the quirky anecdotal variety. For example, Von was raised by a 70-year-old dad recovering from a stroke, so yes, they had to learn to walk at the same time. Meanwhile, Alberstadt can&apos;t get through life without coffee, which he declared not the same as tea, and Hahn confessed he&apos;s addicted to frozen dinners — he had to ""quit cold turkey.""
Paisley was a late addition to the festival — only coming onboard officially last month — but that doesn&apos;t mean he&apos;s a newcomer to comedy.
""My interest comes about because I sort of inadvertently have done comedy my whole performing career, even before it was technically a career,"" Paisley told Rolling Stone Country backstage before the show. ""Back when I was a kid and started playing songs in my hometown, first in church and then in Lion&apos;s Club meetings and church picnics and Fireman&apos;s Balls — which is a funny word — I was very much cracking jokes between songs.""
Paisley emphasized that he&apos;s inspired as a writer by listening to comedians. Which is no surprise when you listen to clever singles like ""Ticks"" or ""Online."" He also hopes to write with his funny new friends someday.
""There&apos;s nothing like a comedian&apos;s perspective to say, &apos;Ah, I&apos;ve never looked at it that way&apos; about life. And I think it&apos;s what we need,"" he says. ""There are so many things wrong in society that comedy and a little sense of humor would fix. One of them being Twitter.""
Paisley cites Louis C.K. as a master of comic timing as well as one of his favorite ""blue"" comedians.
""I mean, he&apos;s not &apos;blue&apos; language-wise or vulgarity, but the subjects he gets away with, I&apos;ve never seen anybody get away with,"" Paisley says. ""Did you ever see the routine that ended his last comedy special? It was &apos;Of course… but maybe…&apos; Which is about the competing thoughts in your mind. One of his jokes on that was &apos;Of course nut allergies are bad. Of course! It&apos;s terrible and we need to do everything we can to fix that. But maybe, if a peanut can kill you, you were supposed to die.&apos;""
Paisley cracks himself up recounting the bit. ""He does that with so many subjects,"" he says. ""You cannot believe how he gets there.""
For the most part, Paisley is not nearly as outrageous. As a cheeky co-host of the CMA Awards, he&apos;s cultivated a reputation for having fun with country fans without blatantly mocking them.
In a nutshell, his strategy worked at the comedy festival too. From a microphone offstage, he introduced himself as ""the great Brad Paisley!"" then strolled out to the center ring. When he later asked who in the audience didn’t like country music, about half the room whooped and hollered like it was the Fourth of July. From then on, everything was fair game for the comedians, from ugly Denny&apos;s waitresses to beautiful Brad Pitt.
""One of the things I&apos;m going to do a little bit tonight is to make fun of what we&apos;re perceived to be,"" Paisley said before the show. ""Most of the time it&apos;s not justified but we&apos;re seen as ignorant, inbred hillbillies in a lot of circles. So, I find a little pride in that, at times. There&apos;s comedy in that. Hee Haw played with it for years. That&apos;s all they did. We&apos;re going to pretend to be the absolute stereotype and get laughs for it.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202628.42/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322034516-20190322060516-00451.warc.gz

Out comes a barrage of guitar riffage, followed by a solo that leaps from Van Halen-style fret-tapping to bluegrass-on-speed velocity. ""It&apos;s like, &apos;What is that?&apos;"" Paisley grins. ""I couldn&apos;t have done that in 1989 — you think I could&apos;ve gotten away with a tap solo?"" He mimes a shrieky air-guitar solo. ""But it fits our format now. It all becomes country eventually, somehow. We assimilate it like the Borg.""
Brad Paisley Throws a Party With &apos;Moonshine&apos;
As much as any contemporary country act, Paisley blends his mutual loves of classic country and classic rock, as revealed when he ran down a few of his favorite musical things to Rolling Stone:
Favorite Country AlbumWith hardly a pause, Paisley names Buck Owens and His Buckaroos&apos; 1966 classic Carnegie Hall Concert. ""The greatest band in country music at their height, playing live in front of an audience that didn&apos;t know what to think of them. The audience at Carnegie Hall falls in love with Buck right before your very ears. They played their asses off — Don Rich has never played better — and their harmonies were this tight. Buck was so unique and so charming, and he had perfect pitch. I asked him if they had stage monitors and he said, &apos;No, we couldn&apos;t hear anything.&apos; They were just signing and blasting through.""
Favorite New Country Song Rather than pick a current chart-topper, Paisley went underground, selecting alt-country singer-songwriter Jason Isbell&apos;s ""Elephant."" ""Unbridled, ridiculous art. I heard the song and I couldn&apos;t believe somebody would write about a woman with cancer. It has the F word and it&apos;s used like you think, not as a cuss word. It&apos;s just bizarre and really cool. It&apos;s not at all modern commercial country. It&apos;s interesting to hear what somebody does when they have no interest in playing by the rules.""
Favorite American Band""The Eagles — they&apos;re the American band. The Stones were a big influence on me and the Beatles, obviously. But they&apos;re all British. Here you have this band coming out of America that&apos;s as country as anything. The Desperado album, all that &apos;Doolin-Dalton&apos; stuff? That&apos;s a country album, through and through. No question. Then they turn around and do Hotel California. The coolest thing. Something about cactuses and rock music is a good combination.""
Most Unlikely InfluenceAs a kid, Paisley devoured albums like Eric Clapton&apos;s Slowhand and Jeff Beck&apos;s Blow by Blow and had his mind blown when he caught a Clapton concert years ago. But his first-ever rock show was a Huey Lewis and the News gig in his native West Virginia in 1986. ""They&apos;d just released Fore! and the current single was &apos;Jacob&apos;s Ladder,&apos;"" he recalls fondly. ""It was fantastic. Huey was standing on top of the monitors playing harp — oh my God. They were just burning it down in the Eighties, and then it became uncool to like them. But you look back at his music and it&apos;s awesome R&B. And it&apos;s so close to country. You think about &apos;Working for a Living&apos; — that&apos;s a steel guitar away from country.""
And in keeping with his Lewis Love... Favorite Guitar SoloThe one in ""The Power of Love,"" of course. ""I could tell Chris Hayes was a badass when I heard that song. It&apos;s a song written for a movie, so they probably threw it together quickly. But he does this pentatonic thing in the middle of this major song. He always found a way to use that blues and jazz influence in what he did.""
Favorite Hat MakerNo surprise here. ""Stetson. They make my hats. It&apos;s a really personal thing. A hat has to be shaped to a person&apos;s face so it fights just right. It has to be done right. If you put my hat on, with my shape, you&apos;d look like an idiot. If the bill is too high or too saggy, you look like a European tourist going to their first country concert.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202781.33/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323080959-20190323102959-00044.warc.gz
164,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/brad-paisley-tapped-as-team-blakes-mentor-on-the-voice-38733/,"Brad Paisley is joining The Voice next season, serving as an advisor to contestants on Blake Shelton&apos;s team. The news arrives one year after Paisley&apos;s two-month stint on ABC&apos;s now-defunct Rising Star, a similarly-styled singing competition in which Paisley, Ke$ha and Ludacris all served as judges. 

""If you know anything about country music, you know who Brad Paisley is,"" Shelton tells People.com. ""He&apos;s Entertainer of the Year. He&apos;s Male Vocalist of the Year. He&apos;s sold millions of albums and sold out tours. He&apos;s just one of the more respected singers.""
Along with Maroon 5&apos;s Adam Levine, Shelton is the only judge to  remain with The Voice over the show&apos;s eight seasons. When he helped launch the series in 2011, singing competitions tended to be judged by pop and rock & roll veterans, with country singers relegated to guest appearances instead of permanent positions. Shelton helped turn the tide, with Keith Urban — who became an American Idol judge in early 2013 — following closely behind. Coincidentally, Paisley was rumored to have been offered a spot on Idol&apos;s staff in 2012 but turned it down.
The Voice&apos;s ninth season kicks off September 21st. Although the NBC show has yet to officially announce all of its guest mentors, Paisley will reportedly be joined by Missy Elliot (the advisor for Team Pharrell), Selena Gomez (advisor for judge — and soon-to-be single woman — Gwen Stefani) and John Fogerty (mentor for the show&apos;s closest approximation of a rock & roller, Adam Levine).

165,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/brad-paisley-throws-a-party-with-moonshine-201201/,"After releasing what was arguably his most ambitious work last year in Wheelhouse, Brad Paisley decided to take a back-to-basics approach for his upcoming new album, Moonshine in the Trunk, which is due out on August 26th. Both were recorded in the same studio — however, one unique fixture was brought in to liven up the sessions.
100 Greatest Country Songs of All Time
""I put it a bar in there,"" Paisley — who, ironically, does not drink — tells Rolling Stone Country. ""I actually built a pub at the end of the house. I was like, &apos;Let&apos;s make this record feel like a party.&apos; I think a record should be a bit of a party, especially when you cut it like I do with non-hired guns. It&apos;s my band - it&apos;s the guys that you see on the stage with me and some co-writers that are always busy working with some lyrical changes with me.""
Making Moonshine in the Trunk — which contains his latest hit single ""River Bank"" —  was a blast, says Paisley, adding that he thinks he wrote his best songs yet. ""The hard part about Wheelhouse was I felt like it was at a time when I wanted to say everything on here is a stretch of some sort. And then obviously there&apos;s the stylistic stuff where you bring in a jazz thing, bring in a rapper, bring a rock influence that you didn&apos;t expect, bring in a twist, whatever it might be. It was throw the kitchen sink at it and see what we can get away with. And we answered that. [laughs]. This time, you take away that rule book and say, &apos;Now, how do I make the best record that I can make? How do I make something that would be my favorite album if I was going to buy a country album right now?&apos; That was really the goal.""
It&apos;s not to say that Paisley hasn&apos;t stopped experimenting when it comes to his music. In the same sentence, he mentions the seemingly unlikely pairing of dubstep and a banjo that is on one track. ""Already a banjo is a dubstep instrument anyway, so that&apos;s essentially nothing but dubstep. But when you take it and you put it in stutter edit [imitating sounds], it comes back up, it&apos;s still country. You can&apos;t take the country away from the banjo. And that&apos;s a basically love song.
""We&apos;ve had a blast in this sort of laboratory I&apos;ve built on the farm,"" he continues. ""I think if we learned anything from Wheelhouse, it&apos;s how to use all these things. But now we took away being shocking for the sake of it. You throw that away, and now you&apos;re just like, &apos;What enhances the song?&apos; and write the song first.  And we wrote the songs first and there you go.""
One thing that is for certain on Moonshine in the Trunk is that there won&apos;t be a reprise of ""Accidental Racist,"" his critically-panned duet with hip-hop star LL Cool J that garnered much media attention last year over its attempt to address the still-prevalent problem of racism. The singer says he does venture into unchartered lyrical territory again on the new project, but this time in a way that oversteps boundaries in more of a refreshing way.
""I think my format will be like, &apos;Oh, great! Good, yes, somebody&apos;s singing that.&apos; Because right now it&apos;s not hard to stretch from what&apos;s on our airwaves because it&apos;s a very limited sort of thing. There&apos;s a lot of people complaining about that. So I try to look at it from that perspective and I see that as opportunity. That&apos;s like, &apos;Well, you won&apos;t expect this, let&apos;s sing this, this will be fun.&apos; And also something that my fans will be like, &apos;You know what, I&apos;m so glad to hear that topic.&apos;
""I hope [Moonshine in the Trunk] is something that you can put in your car and you&apos;ll remember a lot of things about it right first listen, and it&apos;ll also go down fairly smooth. But at the same time, I think you&apos;ll see the creativity, too. There&apos;s not phoning anything in on this record.""
Meanwhile, Paisley recently released a lighthearted music video for the single ""River Bank,"" featuring himself strumming a guitar in the water and a jet-skiing squirrel. (Watch it below.) ""That&apos;s going over great,"" he says of the song. ""That&apos;s a really good example of some of the things on this album where that sounds completely new, yet it&apos;s not uncharted territory. It&apos;s a hook that I haven&apos;t heard before. I can&apos;t believe it&apos;s been decades of country music and no one ever wrote &apos;Laughing all the way to the river bank&apos;…. Thanks everybody for waiting on that for me. [laughs]. I appreciate it.""
Some of the new album&apos;s songs will also performed onstage as part of Paisley&apos;s current tour that is sponsored by Kraft Cheese. Not only is Paisley the face of the company&apos;s ad&apos;s latest campaign, but he also even co-directed several spots for it that feature him in funny cheese-themed situations.
""I said, &apos;First of all, if we are going to do this type of partnership, let&apos;s really collaborate,&apos;"" he says of his involvement in the videos. ""&apos;Let&apos;s not farm it out to a third party where they come up with it, and you&apos;re not that happy and I&apos;m not happy when it&apos;s over. Let&apos;s really make this who we are.&apos; And they had their ideas and we had ours and they were great about that as far as the way they wanted their product presented and the way I wanted to be presented, which is I like to be an idiot.

167,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/bradley-walker-on-joey-feeks-influence-behind-new-album-107708/,"When Bradley Walker fulfilled one of the last requests of his friend Joey Martin Feek, he had no idea that his simple act of love would also lead to his new album, Call Me Old-Fashioned.Joey and husband/singing partner Rory Feek met Walker nearly a decade ago and became close friends. Before she died of cancer in March, she expressed wishes for Walker to sing at her funeral.  ""I could hardly take it,"" Walker says of his reaction to the request. Sitting in the barn at Joey and Rory&apos;s farm, it&apos;s obvious that it&apos;s still hard for him to talk about the passing of his friend. ""Rory called me that night they were on their way back to Tennessee, and asked me to sing. There&apos;s only one answer: &apos;Of course I&apos;ll sing.&apos; For him to pick the phone up and call me and for her to want me to sing, there&apos;s no greater honor for a singer than to be able to do that for somebody.""Walker sang the hymn Joey requested, ""Leave it There,"" at her graveside service at the couple&apos;s Tennessee Farm. Among those present at the service were Southern gospel legend Bill Gaither, his wife Gloria and the team from Gaither Music Group. They were so impressed with Walker&apos;s voice, they signed him to a record deal. ""You never know how God can take a devastating, terrible situation and bring a blessing out of it,"" Walker says. ""Joey has blessed so many people with her story and the way she lived her life right up until the very end.  I feel like she&apos;s upstairs looking down on all of this smiling.""Rory produced Call Me Old-Fashioned and hosted the companion concert DVD, which was filmed in his barn, which occasionally doubles as a live music venue. It will air as a TV special on several networks including RFD-TV, PBS, Gaither TV, TBN, Family Net, and CTN, and will also be available at retail. ""Bradley is one of my wife&apos;s and my favorite singers and even more than that, one of our favorite people that we&apos;ve ever met,"" Feek says of Walker, whose album released September 23rd. ""His heart is even bigger than his voice, and that&apos;s saying a lot. I&apos;m proud to be a small part of the world discovering what a talent Bradley Walker is.""Born with muscular dystrophy, Walker has spent his life in a wheelchair, but has never let his physical challenges dim his passion for music. The Oak Ridge Boys invited him to sing on national television when he was only 10 years old. He recalls meeting the legendary Keith Whitley that night and from then on, he knew he wanted to be a country singer. Yet his practical streak led Walker to get an education and take a job as a materials analyst at Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, where he continues to work when he&apos;s not recording and performing. ""I try to let nothing hold me back,"" says Walker, who credits his parents with encouraging his dreams. ""I know it&apos;s cost Mom a lot of sleepless nights a lot of times when I would get in my vehicle and drive to Nashville to go to the Station Inn to hear some good music or go to the Opry and hang out.""Legendary songwriter Carl Jackson produced Walker&apos;s debut album, Highway of Dreams, which helped earn Walker the Male Vocalist of the Year Award from the International Bluegrass Music Association. That album also led to him meeting the Feeks. ""I met Joey and Rory in 2007,"" he recalls. ""They had heard my album and loved it. I got a friend request from Joey one night on MySpace, and just fell in love with her voice and then met them not long after that and fell in love with her as a person.""Though Walker&apos;s initial success was in bluegrass, he&apos;s always had an affinity for traditional country music. He cites country greats Merle Haggard, George Jones, Gene Watson and Vern Gosdin as his primary influences, and Call Me Old-Fashioned is filled with faith-based country songs that would make his heroes proud.The album includes a touching rendition of the Kris Kristofferson classic ""Why Me Lord,"" the classic hymn ""Sweet Beulah Land,"" and ""I Feel Sorry for Them,"" an original song he penned with Feek and Tim Johnson that perfectly captures Walker&apos;s attitude: ""From the day that I was born, I&apos;ve learned to live with how things are,"" he sings. ""I&apos;ll never step up to the microphone or strum my own guitar/For over 30 years now, I&apos;ve been sitting in this chair/When people stop and ask me if I think life&apos;s been unfair, I say.../I feel sorry for the hard-working mother raising children on her own/And I feel sorry for the one who has to call a cold underpass his home/And all the lonely people out there who cannot find a friend/I feel sorry for them.""Call Me Old-Fashioned also includes a posthumous duet with Joey on ""In the Time That You Gave Me."" The late singer had previously recorded the song, so Rory took her vocals and combined them with Walker&apos;s. ""To be able to record that with Joey&apos;s voice, it was very hard to get through that when we tracked it in the studio,"" he says. ""It&apos;s tough to listen to, but it&apos;s such an honor for me and not only just to have a song on here with Joey, but to have that song. It&apos;s special.""When asked to describe Call Me Old-Fashioned, Walker has unique and fairly unexpected response: ""I think of this as a gospel record for people who don&apos;t go to church,"" he says. ""I hope this can be an inspiration not only to people who are saved and who are in church —because I believe that&apos;s where we all need to be, but I want to reach people also who aren&apos;t in church and get them thinking about life. These are songs about real life.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202640.37/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322074800-20190322100800-00142.warc.gz

Whitford will play iconic songwriter and music publisher Fred Rose, who co-wrote with Williams such classic tunes as ""Kaw-Liga"" and ""I&apos;ll Never Get Out of This World Alive."" He also penned numerous songs recorded by other artists including the Willie Nelson hit, ""Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain"" and ""Deed I Do,"" by Sophie Tucker. With entertainer Roy Acuff, Rose formed Acuff-Rose, one of the most successful music publishing companies of all time. He was inducted, along with Williams and Jimmie Rodgers as one of the first members of the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1961.
Jones, who won an Emmy portraying the president on the drama series, 24, will play Williams&apos; mother, Jessie Lillybelle ""Lillie"" Skipper Williams. The actors join previously announced cast members Tom Hiddleston as Williams, Elizabeth Olsen as Hank&apos;s first wife, Audrey, and Wrenn Schmidt as Bobbie Jett, who gave birth to the singer&apos;s daughter, Antha Belle Jett (who now goes by Jett Williams), just five days after his death on New Year&apos;s Day 1953.

If you're someone like Samantha Bee, that might mean a good ""healing cry."" Or, in the case of Wednesday night's Full Frontal With Samantha Bee, hearing Brandi Carlile sing a joyous version of ""Hold Out Your Hand.""
Bee introduced Carlile's performance with an utterly relatable reflection on feeling overwhelmed, joking that she copes by doing things such as ""eating a pie like it's a sandwich."" At the mention of the Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter's name, Bee says, ""Oh my god, I feel a healing cry coming on already."" Carlile's performance on Full Frontal is more likely to induce tears of joy than rage, though, her voice ragged and raspy on each end-of-your-rope verse before hitting a jubilant release in the choruses with the help of her six-piece band. Carlile's ""Wa-hoo!"" cry after the second verse is enough to exercise some demons all on its own.

170,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/brandi-carlile-home-life-new-music-804058/,"Brandi Carlile is cruising down a steep road on her four-wheeler, her teal jacket flapping in the wind as she makes a sharp turn to her home in Maple Valley, Washington, a rural mountain town about 45 minutes outside of Seattle. It’s not an easy house to find — even the GPS gets confused around here. “Those things make up roads sometimes,” Carlile says. “Sometimes, it says this one doesn’t even exist.”
It’s a misty midmorning in a scene out of Twin Peaks, with fog shrouding the evergreen trees around the log cabin she bought at 21, and now shares with her wife, Catherine Shepherd, and their two children. Carlile pulls into the driveway, hops down and lands light on the gravel. This is her “happy place,” she says.
Inside, Shepherd is observing Evangeline, their fair-haired four-year-old, as she sits at the counter of their open kitchen making a necklace. Elijah, nine months, is on the floor playing with Laura Rogers from the Muscle Shoals, Alabama, duo the Secret Sisters, whose album Carlile is in the middle of producing at her home studio. Up above them, a homemade sign hangs from the rafters to commemorate Carlile’s recent Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year for her sixth LP, By the Way, I Forgive You: “Six nominations! Are you kidding me with this? Congrats!”
“Do you want to go outside, get a fire going?” asks Carlile. In jeans, a slouchy beige sweater and a pair of fur-lined Gucci loafers, she leads us to a wood deck that overlooks the home’s vast property. Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready owns the land to one side, and Carlile’s bandmate and brother-in-law Phil Hanseroth lives to the other. Some of their neighbors raise and slaughter a steer once a year; it’s not uncommon to spot a bear nearby. Just down the road is the pasture where, for many years, Carlile kept her horse Sovereign — named after her first guitar, a Harmony Sovereign that her mother found behind a casino.
When Sovereign died in September, Carlile, 37, was devastated. “It was almost as profound as having a child,” she says, sipping a mimosa by the fire. She was 17 when she bought Sovereign for $75, taking him home on a leash. “It changed all my choices,” she adds. “I didn’t get to fuck off; I didn’t get to not have a job. I had to make all these adult decisions, and develop this work ethic.”
That work ethic helped give Carlile the best year of her career in 2018. Produced by Dave Cobb and Shooter Jennings, By the Way, I Forgive You is all about “radical forgiveness,” grounded in a kind of storytelling that feels particularly apt for our current political moment. Carlile sings about drug addiction on “Sugartooth,” rallies for the misfits on “The Joke” and navigates passion and pain on “Party of One.” She’d always been something of a renegade folk-rock star. In the past year plus, she’s become something more — a leader of a musical resistance, fighting hate with mercy. She also performed for Joni Mitchell, appeared in A Star Is Born, booked her own all-women festival in Mexico, raised more than $700,000 for Syrian refugees, held a spot on Barack Obama’s favorite-songs playlist (for the second year in a row) and welcomed a little girl. “I sat down Catherine and said, ‘I’m so sorry, but this year I’m going for it,’ ” Carlile says, peeling back the wrapper on a granola bar. “Because this is the record.”
Among other things, By the Way, I Forgive You is the finest showcase yet for Carlile’s vocal power: She can belt like Adele or push to the very edge of her range, then pull back to warmth. “Brandi is the only singer to make me consistently cry when I hear her voice,” says McCready. “Perhaps some demons are being exorcised in her brutal honesty of forgiveness.”
Like many, Carlile was angry after the last presidential election. She recalls sobbing at Heathrow Airport the morning of November 9th, 2016. It didn’t take long for her to decide to channel that rage into action and, eventually, into music. “[Trump] is so aggressive and loud and ugly — we don’t need more aggressive and loud and ugly,” Carlile says. “We need debilitating empathy.”
It’s an approach with some striking similarities to that of her most famous fan, President Obama. “They have similar outlooks,” says Pete Souza, the former White House photographer who turned his boss on to Carlile’s music. “Though I don’t know if [Obama] has as much forgiveness as Brandi does.”
Growing up in Ravensdale, Washington, about 10 miles down the road from her current home, Carlile didn’t just want to sing: She wanted to be a rock star. “I became obsessed with making it, and I willed myself to be talented,” she says. As a kid she’d lock herself in a closet, singing “Unchained Melody” or “Bohemian Rhapsody,” pushing herself over and above the highest notes. “Pretty soon I could hit them, and then I could hold them. And then I could hold them as long as Freddie Mercury.”
She entered contests around the state, but she never won anything. The Queen frontman was a particular source of inspiration, as was Elton John. “I was uncomfortable in my gender, I was poor, I was gay,” she says. “I was pretty convinced I was a flamboyant gay rock star in the making.”



When she first started playing around Seattle, it was primarily restaurant gigs: an Irish pub, a clam shack, a joint where she’d sit after closing and drink grape soda while the owner snorted cocaine. She’d do nightly sets at these places, and during the breaks she’d go table to table, talking to folks in attendance and getting their phone numbers and email addresses. Then, when she had a proper club show, she’d call them all and invite them out. “Pretty soon,” she says, “I started selling out regular venues. I always thought that I was right on the verge of making it.”
Around this time, Carlile met twin brothers Tim and Phil Hanseroth, who became her band and co-writers. Her second album, 2007’s The Story, was an early breakthrough, with the title ballad landing on Grey’s Anatomy. Carlile spent the better part of the next decade making records and touring nonstop, ending up in a bitter cycle of sleeping pills, steroids and caffeine to get through the days. Then she met Shepherd, who was Paul McCartney’s charity coordinator at the time, and who promptly fell for another side of Carlile: the rural artist who’d grown up fishing and still rides tractors. “She told me, ‘I think you should integrate that into your work, and be a little more honest about the other parts of you,’ ” Carlile recalls. “So I did. As that happened, my albums have resonated with people differently. Maybe I wasn’t as cool as I thought I was.”
Carlile has done activist work for years, launching campaigns against violence and hunger with her non-profit group, the Looking Out Foundation, but she says becoming a mother awakened a new urgency in her. She kicked off her Girls Just Wanna Weekend festival in Mexico in January as a way of fighting the festival circuit’s gender imbalance, headlining a bill with Margo Price, Maren Morris and others. She also utilized an all-women crew for her “Party of One” video, which portrays pure, passionate love that just happens to be between two women. “She fights the good fight for truth and equality and puts her money where her mouth is every time,” says her friend Jim James. “And I believe her every step of the way.”
She’ll carry this philosophy through to her next project, an all-star country band with Amanda Shires called the Highwomen — a nod to Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson’s Highwaymen. “Yes, we don’t want to hear the words ‘female singer-songwriter’ ever again,” she says. “But we have to use it right now. Because we need representation.”
Carlile remembers that the Secret Sisters are probably waiting for her to get to work, so we head to the studio, a place she helped build herself, “ice-picking trenches across the driveway.” Inside she finds the sisters and the Hanseroth twins, eager to perfect the arrangements for a song called “Quicksand.”
The recording space is warmly decorated, but it feels different than other studios — mostly because it isn’t loaded with endless instruments collecting dust. Carlile tells me that she isn’t big on holding on to things like that. “If it’s sitting on the wall just because it’s valuable, and you are not playing it, and there are 18-year-old girls everywhere scraping to earn enough money to buy a guitar, how can you not give it away?” she told me earlier, as the fire crackled. “It’s not useful until it’s out in the world.”",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202728.21/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323060839-20190323082839-00274.warc.gz
171,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/brandi-carlile-new-album-i-forgive-you-is-about-life-being-f-king-hard-202472/,"Brandi Carlile has only been discussing her new album for a few short minutes before she launches, unprompted, into an explanation of The Bridge, an obscure British documentary about those who commit suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.

""I have a little bit of a fascination with jumpers,"" Carlile says, responding to a seemingly innocuous question about ""Harder to Forgive,"" the penultimate song on Carlile's new album By the Way, I Forgive You. When she was in high school, Carlile's friend committed suicide by jumping, a death she wrote about on 2009's ""That Year."" Ever since, she's been preoccupied with the subject.

But Carlile also has a specific point to make: She learned by watching The Bridge that the vast majority of those who jump from the Golden Gate do so off the side of the bridge that looks out on the city versus the side that faces the empty expanse of nature and water.

""You would think that if you were compelled to make that decision, that the blackness wouldn't be terrifying to you,"" she says. ""But they all choose the people, they all choose the light, they jump towards the city. That's the profound thing about forgiveness, is that innately, we all want to do it. We just don't know how.""

The Golden Gate Bridge anecdote has been rolling around Carlile's mind lately as she ponders her new album, which is centered around the idea of forgiveness, a radical concept, Carlile thinks, that too often gets treated as saccharine or moralist.

""The last thing I want on this record is for it to sound like I'm using forgiveness in the white evangelical use of the term,"" she says. ""I worry that people in the world might consider that forgiveness isn't radical, but it is fucking radical. We just don't do it very often or as much as we'd like to sing about it and wave our arms.""

On Carlile's sixth album, which was co-produced by Shooter Jennings and roots superproducer Dave Cobb, the singer-songwriter plunges deep into family dynamics, politics, addiction and identity on a collection of original songs written by Carlile and Phil and Tim Hanseroth – ""The Twins,"" as she calls them ­– who have been playing, recording, and writing with Carlile since the beginning of her career.
""We chose to talk about finding a way to fundamentally forgive and accept life for being fucking hard.""
All of these heavy topics came to a head during the writing of By the Way, I Forgive You, which Carlile, 36, sees as the most probing, profoundly intense record of her career.

""Everything that's happened over the past 10 years: people killing themselves, issues with our families, the twin's divorces, all these things caught up to us. All these things that you shut down in favor of momentum and motion just found their way to the three of us at one time, so we opened the packages back up and just dealt with it,"" she says. ""You can do any number of things with that, but what we chose to do is to talk about finding a way to fundamentally forgive and accept life for being fucking hard.""

As a result, there is nary a lightweight song on By the Way, an elegant, deeply emotional work of reckoning, confrontation, soul-searching and, yes, forgiveness.

The songs span a range of styles and sounds, from the orchestral grandeur of ""The Joke"" and the Avett Brothers-inspired folk-pop stomp on ""Hold Out Your Hand"" to ""Fulton County Jane Doe"" – which Shooter Jennings describes as ""a cross between Levon Helm and Elton John"" – and the heartbreaking piano torch ballad ""Party of One"" that closes the album.

Entries like ""Most of All"" and ""Mother"" are personal reflections on family, while ""Fulton County Jane Doe"" and ""Sugartooth"" gently nod outward at the opioid epidemic and global migration crises.



 

Mostly, though, the album serves as a communal confessional booth, a meeting place where former lovers, old friends and siblings reunite in repentance and grant one another pardon.

""If I don't owe you a favor, you don't know me,"" Carlile sings at one point.

A few songs later: ""Sometimes I pretend we never met / Because it's harder to forgive than to forget.""

""We all came to the table with these songs that were hard to talk about, hard to get through, and that's not really something that's happened before,"" says the singer. ""Maybe there'd be a couple of those songs every couple of records, but never anything like this where every song we chose wound up being hard to sing, hard to talk about.""

When Carlile entered the studio last year in Nashville with Jennings and Cobb, it had been a dozen years since she released her debut self-titled album and a decade since her breakthrough 2007 LP The Story, produced by T Bone Burnett.

In the years since, Carlile has made several major-label albums, including 2009's Rick Rubin-produced Give Up the Ghost, followed by a string of independent releases. Along the way, she's established herself as one of the most dependable and intimate live singer-songwriter acts working today, selling out theaters across the country with her band that straddles the line between singer-songwriter folk, rootsy country and unadorned Americana pop.

""Brandi is a blowtorch of a human being, in the greatest way,"" says her friend and co-producer Shooter Jennings. ""She's somehow come through her whole crazy experience in the music industry innocent and unscathed. That's the thing that's the most awesome about being around her – there's an optimism that has not been crushed.”

In person, Carlile is a warm, intense conversationalist. She makes a lot of eye contact, and several times during the interview, she interrupts herself, mid-answer, to ask a question.

""Are you afraid of heights?""

""Do you have any kids?""

When I answer ""no"" to the latter question, Carlile says: ""First of all, that's lovely. I would say give it some fucking thought! It turns you into a total emotional wreck. It can be an introduction into some really powerful and overwhelming empathy, where you read about or see anyone and you no longer are able to see anybody as anything other than somebody’s baby.""

Starting a family has had a profound impact on Carlile's artistic process in a number of ways. For one, it's influenced her songwriting. ""I edit out the bullshit real quick now,"" she says. ""Now I'm just a human lie detector for myself.""

It's also given Carlile a certain perspective on her own parents and on the nation's larger political climate.

""It was a rough year, starting with the election, and then everyone started dying, our heroes started dying, so we started thinking about our own parents, like, 'OK, how long do we have to be in this bubble now?'"" says the singer. ""We were in this other bubble for the last eight years, but how much longer do we get to be in the 'My Parents Are Alive' bubble? Or the 'Nothing Fucked Up Has Happened to My Children' bubble? And thinking about that just opened a door, and suddenly we didn't care if it rhymed. We didn't care if it made us look sloppy, or unhip, and we wound up writing some shit we could never come back from.""

There's one memory from the past two years that Brandi Carlile can't shake.

""I really feel like when my life flashes before my eyes one day, I’m going to see myself in a London airport, just crying."" Carlile is referring to the morning of November 9th, 2016, when she sat in an airport sobbing as she stared at the American election results on television with her two-year-old daughter.

""Thinking that a social environment in our country was a fringe group and then seeing that it was this huge, huge contingency was a big awakening for me,"" she says.

Carlile considers herself to be in the earliest stages of becoming an artist-activist. ""It's an evolution that I'm at the very, very beginning of,"" she says. It's also an evolution that started when Carlile met her current wife, Catherine Shepherd, who promptly introduced her to War Child, a British-based organization that provides support and assistance to children affected by war.

Last year, she released Cover Stories, a charity album in which a host of artists, including Dolly Parton, Pearl Jam, Adele and Kris Kristofferson, performed renditions from Carlile's 2007 album The Story, with all proceeds going to the organization.

""My work for War Child has been a real life-changer for me,"" says the singer. ""It's one thing to take up a cause and feel passionate about it, and it's one thing to write songs about that cause because you think it will be impactful. But it's most impactful if you're writing the song about that because it's just as moving to you as the love song or the song about your family.

""It's about whatever puts that lump in my throat, because that lump in my throat is a song. And right now, the refugees put that lump in my throat,"" she continues. ""My little baby, the one on the way, my family and feeling like it's under attack, because I'm gay and because I’m married to a woman that's not a U.S. citizen: those things put a lump in my throat, and I've got to sort that out, or I'm going to get cancer. I've got to write those songs, because there's really no other way to get rid of it.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201922.85/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319073140-20190319095140-00311.warc.gz
172,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/brandi-carlile-party-of-one-video-elisabeth-moss-767553/,"Brandi Carlile remembers exactly where she was when she came up with “Party of One.”

“I was drunk. I was listening to [Joni Mitchell's] Blue in the hayloft of my barn, and I was feeling an insane amount of pressure to make my domestic life work, more pressure than a straight person,” the singer, who earned six Grammy nominations last week, tells Rolling Stone Country.

Carlile has just released a music video, starring Elisabeth Moss, for “Party of One,” the concluding statement on the singer’s 2018 album By the Way, I Forgive You. The video dramatizes the narrative of fallout and reconciliation that define the song, which Carlile says she wrote about the pressures of queer domesticity.

“We’ve been witnessing an entire generation being granted access to a civil right and all of the pressure and all of the joy that comes with that,” says Carlile, who has been married to her partner since 2012.

Carlile knew she wanted Moss, the star of The Handmaid's Tale, involved and spent nine months writing letters trying to persuade the actress to appear in the video. When Moss, who not only starred but produced and served as creative director of the clip, agreed, she hired an all-female cast to shoot the story of a queer couple going through a fight — and eventual make-up — during one grueling all-day shoot in upstate New York.

“I wanted to capture a love so deep that it permeates everything around you, every object and every inch of space,” says Bérénice Eveno, the video’s director, in a statement. “A love that haunts you and never lets go.”

The shoot culminated in a scene in which Moss and costar Nicole Disson get into a screaming fight on camera, an intense on-set moment that is still fresh in Carlile's memory.

“It was so uncomfortable that four out of five people in the room burst into tears,” she says. “They really properly fought, it was so intense. I chewed off my fingernails. That scene took 10 years off my life.”

“Party of One,” which was recently re-released as a duet with Sam Smith, is an unlikely choice for a single.

When Gregg Nadel, head of Elektra Records, told Carlile he was interested in making a video for the song, the singer was taken aback. “You’re the weirdest record label guy I have ever met. I love that song, but it’s not in any way commercial,"" she says. "" It’s six and a half minutes, and it couldn’t be more of a ballad. I don’t know why you’d want to do that.”",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203448.17/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324124545-20190324150545-00521.warc.gz

A graceful piano ballad, the original appears as the final track on Carlile's latest album, By the Way, I Forgive You.

 

Carlile and Smith recorded the song with producer Dave Cobb at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles. The new recording, which features the two singers trading off verses and harmonizing during the chorus, includes a new orchestral introduction and an added layer of strings throughout the song's first several verses.

 

In a statement, Carlile said that ""Party of One"" ""is a song about deep and enduring compassion. It's about trying to navigate domesticity, love and particularly marriage whilst being willed to fail by those that would revoke that right if they could.""

 

""I am so excited for everyone to have this song in their ears and hearts,"" Smith added. ""Working with Brandi Carlile is truly one of the highlights of my career. Her voice and songwriting get me through the dark days.""

 

Carlile and Smith first met through their individual work with the organization Children in Conflict, which provides support to children affected by war. A portion of the proceeds of ""Party of One"" will be donated to the organization.

174,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/brandi-carlile-sings-the-joke-ellen-794776/,"A few days removed from delivering a stunning version of ""The Joke"" at the 2019 Grammy Awards, Brandi Carlile appeared on Ellen to play a haunting acoustic version of the two-time Grammy-winning track.

""The Joke"" has become a staple not only of Carlile's live shows in the year since it was released on By the Way, I Forgive You, but also of her television appearances. Still, there's a fresh power in seeing her sing it alone. Without the drums kicking in or an intensifying string section, there's an eerie stillness to her singing. And, though she doesn't jump up and down with excitement at song's end like she did last Sunday night, there's clear joy in having hit that signature big note of the final refrain.

Carlile's appearance on Ellen also had a special significance — during one of her three acceptance speeches at the Grammys, the singer paid tribute to host Ellen DeGeneres for inspiring her to come out as a teenager. ""It's a brave thing to do, too,"" DeGeneres tells Carlile after the performance. ""Most people that are performing, they worry about their career, so it's a brave thing for you to be open and out.""

Carlile, whose debut appearance on the show took place in 2010, has since that time become a wife and a mother of two, and at the very beginning of the exclusive clip above, she is surprised onstage by her oldest daughter, 4-year-old Evangeline, who offers her mom a sweet kiss and a warm hug before acknowledging the cheering crowd with a wave then exiting the stage.

""We have a rule where it's like, if Mama's working, it doesn't matter what's going on, she can come on stage and get a kiss,"" Carlile explains.

As she continues strumming her guitar, the singer, who is married to Catherine Shepherd, also notes that their second child, daughter Elijah, was born earlier this year.

""I feel that it's important to stand before you in the great state of Texas and tell you about my family and our right to exist in the world today,"" she said, adding that motherhood was initially a struggle, ""which blossomed into several months of shame.""

Carlile's powerful performance of the alternately hilarious and deeply poignant ""The Mother,"" from the excellent 2018 LP, By the Way, I Forgive You, is just one of the highlights of her nine-song set during the upcoming episode. She also performs a stunning rendition of ""The Joke,"" the soaring ballad about marginalization and alienation made even more heartbreaking, yet ultimately empowering, by the presence of a string quartet.

Also recognized during the episode is Carlile's worship of her music idol, Elton John, with a cover of the title cut from the rock legend's 1971 LP, Madman Across the Water.

Carlile travels to Riviera Maya, Mexico, early next year for the Girls Just Wanna Weekend, an all-female concert event at the Hard Rock Hotel from January 30th through February 4th. Also featured will be Maren Morris, Indigo Girls, Margo Price, Patty Griffin, Lucius, KT Tunstall, Ruby Amanfu and the Secret Sisters.

Austin City Limits, now in its 44th season, airs on PBS stations nationwide. Kacey Musgraves and Lukas Nelson and Promise of the Real will be the guests for the episode airing November 10th.

It was less than a year ago that she was a behind-the-scenes songwriter responsible for some of the biggest hits on country radio, including Miranda Lambert&apos;s ""Mama&apos;s Broken Heart,"" the Band Perry&apos;s ""Better Dig Two"" and Kacey Musgraves&apos; ""Follow Your Arrow."" Now she&apos;s a household name in country music, topping critics&apos; lists with her own album, the stellar 12 Stories, and opening shows for Jennifer Nettles.
10 New Artists You Need to Know
Old Dominion&apos;s Matthew Ramsey, Trevor Rosen, Whit Sellers, Geoff Sprung and Brad Tursi are quietly successful in their own right, and hoping to change the amplification with their upcoming debut album. Ramsey is one of the lyrical masterminds behind the Band Perry&apos;s ""Chainsaw"" and Luke Bryan&apos;s ""Goodbye Girl,"" while he and Rosen collaborated on Craig Morgan&apos;s ""Wake Up Loving You."" Tursi has written songs for Kenny Chesney, the Randy Rogers Band and for the ABC musical drama, Nashville. Rosen was Clark&apos;s co-writer, along with Shane McAnally, on ""Better Dig Two."" And all five have been hitting the songwriting pavement for years, writing for other artists as well as for their own LP, which will include their breakout song, ""Dirt on a Road,"" and new single, ""Shut Me Up.""
Clark and Old Dominion met up one recent morning near Nashville&apos;s Music Row to play journalist for one laughter-packed hour. Making our jobs pretty easy here at Rolling Stone Country, they decided to interview each other, and we just sat back and enjoyed the show.
Clark: Where&apos;d the name Old Dominion come from?
Ramsey: Old Dominion is the nickname for the state of Virginia, and four of us have ties to Virginia.
Tursi: Where&apos;d the name Brandy Clark come from?
[Laughter]
Clark: My dad had a tattoo on his arm that said ""Karen."" He&apos;d had three girlfriends named Karen. He wanted to name me Karen so that tattoo would mean something else, but my mom said no.
Ramsey: That&apos;s a way better story than ours!
Rosen: Was your mom&apos;s name Karen?
Clark: No. Sally! [Laughs] He had that tattoo until he died, and I think he thought naming me Karen would be the big fix. Okay, back to y&apos;all. Did the writing come first or the band?
Ramsey: I moved here for the writing. I started writing songs because I wanted to perform them, but I didn&apos;t come here with that as the goal. I came here to learn to write better songs.
Clark: So you guys first got together as songwriters?
Rosen: Yes. I moved here for the same reasons. So we wrote a lot of songs together. Matt had the band together, and at some point we had been writing so much together that I just said, ""I&apos;m joining the band. You need me on harmony.""
Clark: I got to see y&apos;all play last week, and you have such great energy. You&apos;re one of my favorite live bands out there. What&apos;s your favorite gig you&apos;ve ever played?
Tursi: We have a little following down in Rome, Georgia, that&apos;s really connected with the music. Everyone down there is singing along to every word. There&apos;s a song we have called ""Day One,"" and it has a lot of words, so see the crowd know every word…
Ramsey: It&apos;s a commitment to know those words, because even I don&apos;t know them every night! [Laughs] But everyone was singing louder than us.
Tursi: So Brandy, you&apos;re going on tour with Eric Church. That has to be exciting.
Clark: I&apos;m thrilled.
Ramsey: Are you taking a band?
[Laughter]
Clark: I am taking a band! Come on, we&apos;re playing Madison Square Garden!
Rosen: So how did that come about?
Clark: I think it was because he&apos;s a fan of my album, 12 Stories. I&apos;ve been really lucky, not having a major label deal, to have press and to have other artists take notice. People like Eric, Kacey Musgraves, Jennifer Nettles… Jennifer gave me 51 dates this year. That&apos;s such a gift. It&apos;s one thing to say in an interview, &apos;I really love that person&apos;s music,&apos; which she has a lot, but to really put your money where your mouth is and introduce that person to fans, that&apos;s huge.


Sprung: So you did the whole album without a label. What do you think would&apos;ve been different if you&apos;d had a big label on board?
Clark: Creatively, we were just told to make the record we wanted to make. And I think that would&apos;ve been different. I do have a label now, Slate Creek Records, but they&apos;re small and have that independent spirit of, &apos;Make the music you want to make, and we&apos;ll figure out what to do with it.&apos; But honestly, I don&apos;t think my record would&apos;ve been as successful with a major label involved.
Ramsey: Was there one song that you built the album around?
Clark: Yes, ""Pray to Jesus."" But then as we were making the album, it became ""Take a Little Pill,"" which leads nicely into [current single] ""Hungover."" What about y&apos;all? Is there one song you all agree is Old Dominion?
Ramsey: As writers, you spend so long trying to build your cred as a writer, and then everything comes together at the same time: your artist career happens when your songwriter career is, too. So you have a song you love, but someone else wants to cut it, and you have to let it go. ""Wake Up Loving You"" was our flag for a while, but then Craig Morgan wanted to cut it. It was a big decision and, ultimately, we said, &apos;That&apos;s not the last Craig Morgan song we can write.&apos;
Tursi: The songs that we do keep have a certain swagger. We know if a song is a band song.
Clark: Like ""Dirt on a Road.""
Rosen: When do you know that a song you&apos;ve written is a Brandy Clark song?
Clark: Usually when no one else will cut it!
[Laughter]
Clark: It&apos;s my job to cut the songs that other people are too scared to cut. Songs like ""Take a Little Pill."" There are songs I’m hanging onto right now, because I&apos;m working on another project. But most of the time, it just doesn&apos;t work for anyone else. If a song is going to work for Miranda [Lambert], like ""Mama&apos;s Broken Heart,"" I would have never cut that. If that works for her, it doesn&apos;t work for me. We already have Miranda. I can&apos;t compete with her!
Clark: So, you guys have told me before about haters, and I think it&apos;s great that you laugh at them. I can&apos;t do that.
Ramsey: Because you don&apos;t have any!
[Laughter]
Clark: No, I do! And the ones I have are pretty strong. Some guy posted the other day, ""Country radio, please play Brandy Clark. She&apos;s the savior of country music."" And another guy wrote, ""Your savior is my Satan."" So yeah, I have haters.
Clark: ""Dirt on a Road"" is a huge hit on [Sirius XM&apos;s] the Highway. I&apos;d love to hear what that did in terms of ticket sales, and also in terms of the haters y&apos;all have told me about.
Ramsey: It did a lot; no one knew who we were before that song. It&apos;s a polarizing song, so we knew that — out of the gate — a song like that would stir attention. So, we welcome the haters because it means people are talking about us! And it didn&apos;t hurt our feelings at all. Berate it all you want, you&apos;re still putting our name out there. We&apos;d been playing for a long time for empty rooms. Then that song became a hit on the Highway, and that helped our shows.
Clark: You guys are doing all these shows traveling in a van. What&apos;s that like?
Rosen: Not as glamorous as you&apos;d think! [Laughs] It&apos;s dirty. Stuff&apos;s everywhere, and we step on each other.
Ramsey: I can&apos;t imagine being a girl out there on the road. We can throw a hat on and stink. Girls have to do their hair. Well, Trevor does, too. But…
Clark: That is true! I&apos;ve recently discovered hot rollers. I&apos;d been on this planet a long time and did not know about hot rollers.
Rosen: That sounds like a good band name, Brandy and the Hot Rollers.
Clark: Y&apos;all are playing with a lot of big names this summer. Who are you most excited about?
Tursi: We have a show with Alabama…. I mean, we&apos;re not on the bill or anything, but… [laughter]
Ramsey: We&apos;re the opening band, and a lot of times no one cares. But we have some shows with Jake Owen and Eli Young Band, and those fans will care. By the time we get about three songs into our set, those are the people who always realize we&apos;re not a crappy band. We&apos;re real. I get excited about a crowd that likes our kind of music.
Clark: And you are a real band. You actually play on your record.
Sprung: We&apos;ve had people tell us, ""I really liked your show. You guys sound like a band."" In Nashville, that&apos;s not a given.
Ramsey: It&apos;s five personalities working together, and the more we play together, the more that grows.
Tursi: And sometimes being not as good [as studio musicians] is actually better!  
Clark: I envy what y&apos;all have, because you&apos;re a team. I&apos;m sure there are times when you get on each other&apos;s nerves, but there&apos;s a lot of time when I&apos;m sitting alone in my dressing room thinking how nice it would be to have someone doing this with me.
Ramsey: How come you wrote ""Better Dig Two"" with Trevor, and where were you when I was single?
[Laughter]
Clark: It was the first time I met Trevor. He started playing the opening to it, and we wrote it from the top down.
Rosen: We didn&apos;t finish the song that day. It was a year later at a writing trip, and we pulled it back up and realized we needed to finish it.
Ramsey: We were at a cabin at Center Hill Lake, and they went upstairs to write their song and me and Josh Osborne and Matt Jenkins wrote another song. At the end of the day, we were like, ""We just wrote an awesome song."" And we played it for y&apos;all and you were like, ""Yeah, that&apos;s awesome but…"" And then you played ""Better Dig Two.""
Clark: Believe me, I understand! Luke Laird and I wrote a song called ""I Drink to Get Drunk"" on the same day ""Merry Go Round"" was written, so I&apos;ve had my moments!
Rosen: And now we have another song by Craig Morgan coming out. 
Ramsey: So together, we are simultaneously saving country music and killing country music!
[Laughter]
Clark: Well, in your defense, one man&apos;s savior is another man&apos;s Satan.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202326.46/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320105319-20190320131319-00158.warc.gz

According to USA Today, Clark had a 3,763 percent increase in ""station adds"" from Sunday night to early Monday on Pandora, as users of the streaming service created a custom station based on interest in her songs. In the hours following the CBS telecast, Clark&apos;s Spotify streams increased 34 percent overall, with ""Hold My Hand"" accounting for a 494 percent jump from previous streams of that same tune before the show aired.
Other performers who got some love from Grammy viewers included Annie Lennox, who teamed on the show with Hozier for ""I Put a Spell on You"" (and saw that tune&apos;s streams increase by 211 percent), and classical rockers ELO, whose collaboration with Ed Sheeran on a version of the group&apos;s 1978 hit, ""Mr. Blue Sky"" became the most searched-for track on Shazam, an app which listens to and identifies songs. ""Hold My Hand"" is a track from Clark&apos;s critically acclaimed album, 12 Stories, released in 2013. ""It&apos;s very vulnerable,"" she says of the ballad, which she and Yoakam performed with only their acoustic guitars and no backing band. ""I think everyone has felt that way, where you&apos;re with somebody who is not quite over somebody that they used to be with and you run into their ex. It&apos;s a moment of truth. They have to make a statement to their ex that they love you the way you used to love them, but deep down inside, you both know that they still have feelings for that person."" The Washington native is currently on the road with Alan Jackson for his 25th Anniversary Tour and heads to Glasgow, Scotland, on March 5th for a show with Lady Antebellum. She&apos;ll then appear at the C2C Festival in London on March 7th and Dublin the following day before resuming on the Jackson tour through May.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201882.11/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319012213-20190319034213-00190.warc.gz

Gilbert, who has stayed true to his own small-town roots in Georgia even as he's become a popular country performer, co-wrote ""What Happens in a Small Town"" with Brock Berryhill, Josh Dunne, and Rhett Atkins. More than a reflection on how quickly word gets around in a close-knit community, the song dwells on the inescapable memories that come with a broken heart, the pain of which are brought to life by Gilbert's forlorn delivery. Ell, however, balances things out not only with her soaring vocal but with her pyrotechnic guitar work, ringing the cloudy skies with a few rays of light.
While Ell released The Continuum Project, a track-by-track remake of John Mayer's Continuum, last May, ""What Happens in a Small Town"" marks the first new original material from either artist since 2017. Both are currently between tours, but Ell is set to hit the road next month starting with a stop in Dallas, Texas, on January 9th.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912206677.94/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326220507-20190327002507-00112.warc.gz

Hosted by local radio station Lightning 100, the gig doubled as a mid-year highlight for the string band, whose three members have spent 2014 in a whirl of van exhaust and truck stops, completing two coast-to-coast tours since January.
Nikki Lane: The Rise of a Country Rebel
With an opening set by country-noir buzz artist Nikki Lane and cameos by Benson and Young Hines, the performance also demonstrated how far the Howlin&apos; Brothers have come since 2007, back when they spent their time playing stripped-down country blues, old-timey folk and ragtag roots-rock for restaurant crowds in north Nashville and tourists on Lower Broadway.
Benson popped up onstage several times throughout the night, playing slide guitar one minute and singing harmonies the next. To their credit, the band didn&apos;t really need him. Ian Craft bounced between fiddle and banjo — occasionally playing a kickdrum at the same time — while guitarist Jared Green stomped out the occasional drumbeat on an elevated floorboard. On record, the boys cover even more ground, with Trouble&apos;s 13 songs focusing on groove as much as chops — a rarity in a world of string-band shredders — while drawing a line between old-world revivalism and progressive bluegrass.
The Howlin&apos; Brothers will be on the road this summer, including dates with Delbert McClinton and John Fullbright. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202131.54/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319203912-20190319225912-00329.warc.gz

Cities on the itinerary are largely located in the South and include Austin, Texas; Memphis, Tennessee; Birmingham, Alabama; and New Orleans, Louisiana. Nestled among the shows are a January 25th stop at the Lincoln Theater in Raleigh, North Carolina supporting American Aquarium, and a January 31st show at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, where Cobb will open for the Tedeschi Trucks Band.

Cobb released his album Providence Canyon earlier in 2018, working with cousin producer Dave Cobb on the project. With songs like ""Ain't a Road Too Long"" and ""Morning's Gonna Come,"" Cobb built on the singer-songwriter introspection of his 2016 album Shine on Rainy Day, adding funk-based grooves and soulful melodies to his mix of sounds.

“Dave and I have been trying since 2006 to make a country funk album,” he told Rolling Stone back in May. “I don’t know if we achieved it yet, but it was a lot of fun trying to make it happen.”

Opinions have been divided on how artists should proceed under the threat of such violence, with some – Grande included – opting to postpone touring obligations for the time being.Singer-songwriter Brent Cobb, who released Shine on Rainy Day in 2016, is currently touring the United Kingdom and was scheduled to play Manchester's Deaf Institute on Tuesday, one day later. The tragedy at Grande's show was clearly on the Georgia native's mind as the date approached, and he wanted to be thoughtful about how he handled his arrival in town. He addressed his fans in the area via Facebook with a message. ""While we do not want to be insensitive to your tragedy, we also refuse to let terrorism win,"" he wrote. ""Our hearts break for your loss and we will be there with you tonight to mourn and help heal.""He posted a quick update after that show, accompanied by a photo: ""Manchester, we did it. Together,"" he wrote.Rolling Stone Country spoke on the phone with Cobb, who plays a show in Birmingham, England, tonight, and talked about the eerie atmosphere of Manchester, along with the importance of carrying on in the face of tragedy.Your Manchester show was thankfully free of any kind of incident. Where were you the day before, when news of the bombing was spreading?The night before we had had an off day in London, and I believe we were just hanging out together, us and Colter Wall, not really up to anything. It got kind of late. We'd just gotten finished eating at a place called Texas Joe's in London. We hung out there and we hung out at a little juke joint he's got in the back. It's all set up just like being back home. We got back to Colter's AirBNB and again, just hanging out, picking guitars, doing regular band stuff. We got ready to go and my guitarist Mike, he's the first one to see anything about it. He just said, ""Holy shit, man. What is going on?"" And he showed me the article about the bombing. It was crazy to be this close, especially in a foreign land. Not that it makes it any better when you're back home and something crazy happens, but especially when you're away like that, it made it a little different.And then you had to roll into Manchester the next day?We had a show scheduled for the next evening in Manchester. I was a little worried. I wasn't worried about our safety. I was worried, initially – the first reaction I had was I didn't want us to play a show and it come across as insensitive. My second reaction was, I also didn't want to endanger anybody. I didn't want people to feel, oh, the guy from the States is here and not even on his own home turf and he's willing to come play. I didn't want people to feel pressured to come out, either. Those were my first initial emotions. I didn't want people to think we were insensitive, I didn't want people to feel like they had to come if we played, but I also didn't want to not play. You can't let that terrorism win, which is why I sent that [Facebook] note out.Part of what musicians of all levels do, is you're providing entertainment and a place for people to enjoy themselves. It's almost like giving terrorists what they want if you decide not to do that. Exactly. Music brings people together, which is exactly what people who terrorize people don't want to happen. People don't want people to enjoy themselves with other people enjoying themselves.What does it say to you that terrorism is entering this space, where you have things happening at shows like Ariana Grande's and the Eagles of Death Metal concert in Paris? A buddy of mine, [Julian] Dorio, was playing drums for the Eagles when that happened. Man, it's just a shame. It's apparent it's not working in any other way. It just seems like they're going after ... I don't know. The more it doesn't work, the  harder the blow it seems. Man, I mean, it's just so sad. It's a shame. I wish that it didn't exist.It's always a terrible tragedy, with more than 20 people dying in this latest attack, a lot of them kids. How do you even come to grips with that? Kids! And kids that – they don't give a fuck. Like, they're having a blast. Kids that are just getting old enough to enjoy and experience the world for the first time. They don't know that they have to worry about anything. It's just terrible.So what was it like for you, playing in Manchester, one day removed from this? Well, before we played there we had to arrive there. I was so conscious and aware of the moment, as we pulled in. There were kids hanging out on the sidewalk, just got out of school. There were people on the sidewalks hanging out. It did not seem like a place a terrorist attack had happened the night before. So that was hopeful. It was nice pulling in there and it being that way, life going on. Then the gig came and we got to the venue. To be honest, right when we got there I did scout the whole, how-to-get-off-the-stage area out. And where if something were to happen would I go, and just to try to be aware [laughs]. You feel weird doing that, getting to a venue and thinking about things that way because it takes such a pure moment and it doesn't feel as pure. I was never really scared, up until the show came. And I wouldn't say I was scared then, but I was just, my senses were heightened. And everyone in the room, you could tell was that way. We didn't have as big a crowd as we would have had, but we had a decent little crowd. You could tell we all felt, like, you know, united we stand, as everybody says. It really did feel that way, but you could also sense there was an eeriness in the air. People were just being cautious I think. But after about the first three or four songs, we were all loosened up. It turned into a celebration.Do you think you helped give them some catharsis, or helped ease the tension and grief?Maybe I had something to do with it, but I think it was just mainly everybody being able to get out and be in the room together and all together go, ""We're not scared, man. We're gonna have these pints and we're gonna enjoy ourselves."" That was really cool to be a part of. After our set my guitarist and I went out to the patio and everybody came out to the patio. We just all hung out, out there and smoked cigarettes and it was awesome. Talked about the night, talked about the day before. Just really, it was like hanging out with your friends and family.What measures do you think we can take in the U.S., on a small level, on a city level, to try to prevent these things happening?It's really hard to say. And there's a little bit of division. There's a little divide between people on the stances of that. I don't really know what the solution is. I don't know if there is a solution. The only thing to do is, I think you just have to live.Anything else you'd like to add about your experience over there and the people you've met in the wake of this tragedy?Everyone has just remained normally living. I know that's not a beautiful message but really people have just been going about their business. It's nice to see. Last night in London I made mention about Manchester, and I'm sure there were a lot people either from Manchester that were at the show last night or had family and friends there. I said exactly what you and I have talked about. ... It's just nice that we're not letting it stop us from living, and the whole place agreed. Everyone's been that way. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201329.40/warc/CC-MAIN-20190318132220-20190318154220-00318.warc.gz

He&apos;s come a long way. Last month, his second album, Illinois, debuted at Number One, buoyed by the strength of his fourth consecutive Number One single ""Lose My Mind."" 

""It&apos;s an amazing feeling to make music and be able to do this for a living,"" he tells Rolling Stone Country. ""My first album did great and had several Number Ones on it, but you have to up your game and leave it to the fans to go out there and buy it. Otherwise you&apos;re twiddling your thumbs because no one likes it and you&apos;re out of a job."" 
Eldredge won&apos;t be standing in the unemployment line anytime soon, though.
""Everyone jumped on board,"" he says of his runaway success. ""It&apos;s a great feeling to know people are really digging your music and people know your voice, and now I&apos;m just enjoying the ride and building from here.""
With a top album to his credit, he&apos;s about to embark on a co-headlining tour with Thomas Rhett. Their CMT on Tour: Suits and Boots Tour kicks off October 29th in New York City.
""He&apos;s just a great guy, an amazing person,"" Eldredge says of his ""Crash and Burn"" tourmate. ""You always want to tour with people you like to be around because, let&apos;s face it, you go to work with people in a cubicle, you&apos;re friends with these people, hopefully. I just happen to have a little different life where I share it with a bunch of people backstage or on stage, but it&apos;s the same kind of thing.""
The two will switch off headlining every other show during the course of the tour. 
""I want to work with people that I love, with people whose music I love,"" he says. ""I can sit there and say I love [Rhett]. I think he&apos;s a great person. It&apos;s going to be awesome.""
Asked if he&apos;s prepared for the backstage hijinks that will surely transpire when two dudes hit the road together, he admits he&apos;s ready, willing and capable.

""Wanna Be That Song,"" the third track released from his Illinois album, poignantly captures who he wants to be as an artist.

""&apos;Wanna Be That Song&apos; has everything I want to say about love and about what I&apos;m trying to be,"" he tells Rolling Stone Country. ""I wanna be that part of your life, that song that means so much to you, the one that takes you back to that special place. . . the song that makes you laugh, the song that makes you cry when you need to cry, that makes you dance when you need to dance.""
Eldredge came up with the song&apos;s title literally seconds before playing a show.
""It&apos;s kind of a crazy story,"" he recalls. ""I was about to walk on stage at the Kansas Speedway — I was playing a Nascar race — and I said to Scooter Carusoe, who was standing side stage, &apos;I want to write a song called &apos;Wanna Be That Song.&apos;&apos; Then I put my earphones back in and walked right out on stage.
It was three months later that the lyrics came to fruition, in a writing session with Carusoe and the LP&apos;s producer, Ross Copperman. ""Wanna Be That Song"" is one of eight tracks Copperman co-wrote with Eldredge on Illinois. Carusoe has two Illinois co-writes and also helped pen Eldredge&apos;s Number One hit, ""Mean to Me,"" from his first album.
""Wanna Be That Song"" follows two chart-toppers from Illinois, ""Lose My Mind"" and ""Drunk on Your Love.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202804.80/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323121241-20190323143241-00031.warc.gz

""The first thing it does naturally because of human nature is it instills a little bit of fear, and that sucks, I hate that,"" he admits. ""We're actually playing the venue where that went down, and it took me about a day to wrap my head around that.""Young says that despite what happened, seeing the community's resiliency has been an inspiration. Grande has already returned to the city for the One Love Manchester benefit concert, and country artist Brent Cobb performed in Manchester as scheduled just one day after the attack.""Anybody who is willing to come back out after that happened, anybody who loves and supports music that much, that's what we need to remind ourselves of when we're out there performing,"" he says. ""Every day is a risk and all this terrible stuff is going on, but you've gotta just remind yourself that you're blessed to do what you do and there are fans out there being supportive of you.""On June 17th Clare Bowen of the hit TV show Nashville will also perform at the Manchester Arena, taking part once again in this year's Nashville In Concert tour. Sadness and disbelief were her initial reactions to the attack.""There were so many children in the crowd, it was a disgustingly cowardly act,"" she says. ""But the only thing that really conquers fear is love, and that's what we're gonna bring over there. You just can't stop, you've gotta keep going.""She's hoping her new single, ""Love Steps In,"" will help fans all around the world do just that.""It's kind of a love letter to the world,"" she says. ""I kind of realized a while ago that you can't save the world as one person, but when we get to stand onstage and tell stories and hug our fans and sing to them, you can make a little corner of it glow. We're about to go make Manchester Arena glow, and it's the whole basis of my music and what I'm aspiring to, just to show people that wherever you are, whoever you are, whatever's happening, you're not alone.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204885.27/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326075019-20190326101019-00547.warc.gz

Young penned the driving ""Here Tonight,"" which gets some beefed up drums and a rock-anthem feel on Today, with Ben Caver, Justin Ebach and Lady Antebellum's Charles Kelley. Young was on tour with Lady A through much of 2017 and began bringing fellow songwriters on the road in anticipation of recording his second album. Early in the trek, he ended up creating his lead single with Kelley's help.



""[Charles] just walked up, he was like, are you guys out here writing? I want to write,"" Young told Rolling Stone Country before the album was released. ""We're all such big fans we were like, 'Uh, absolutely.' He basically had the idea and the tag melody at the end of the chorus. When I come into something where a lot of the idea is already there, I just need to figure out how to make it work for me. Because it was clear to me that Charles wasn't writing for Lady Antebellum — we were writing it for me.""

In attempting to make the song work for him, Young was also trying to make it work for a large cross section of people.

""We wanted to keep it vague. Intentionally vague in a way that if you tell too detailed of a story, not everybody can make it their love story,"" he added. ""It's the first time we've sent pure tempo to radio. It already sonically feels good, [so] I want to make sure everybody connects their love life, their romantic life to this song. It's hard to do that sometimes, but the three of them are incredible writers. They did a great job of getting it there.""

196,rollingstone.com/music/music-country/,country,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/brett-young-new-album-722270/,"CMA-nominated performer Brett Young will look back to his home state for his second album, Ticket to L.A., arriving via Big Machine Label Group on December 7th.

Ticket to L.A. reunites Young, a native of Southern California, with that album's producer Dann Huff, along with engineer Justin Niebank and executive producer Jimmy Harnen. A release about the album notes that fans will be able to expect some quicker tempos on the album, perhaps a slight turn away from the balladry that made him a fixture on country radio over the last two years. Additionally, pop singer-songwriter Gavin DeGraw joins up with Young on ""Chapters,"" which the two co-wrote with Ross Copperman. Young also wrote songs with such hit tunesmiths as Ashley Gorley, Shane McAnally, Hillary Lindsey and Lady Antebellum's Charles Kelly, among others.

“I decided to name the album Ticket to L.A. because flying home to Los Angeles has become such a big part of my life,” Young says in a release. “A lot of the first record reflected a kind of hard point in my life when I was moving from Los Angeles to Nashville, but I’m in a completely different place now.""

The southern California native has experienced an impressive breakthrough with the singles from his self-titled 2016 debut, all four of which reached Number One on either the Country Airplay or Mediabase charts and have since been certified Platinum. One of them, ""In Case You Didn't Know,"" has achieved Triple Platinum status. In late August, Young received a CMA Awards nomination for New Artist of the Year. Shortly before he releases Ticket to L.A., he'll embark on his headlining Here Tonight Tour on November 16th.

After calling it quits in 2010 with their Last Rodeo farewell tour, Brooks and Dunn are back together, at least in Sin City. 

The iconic country duo of Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn saw multi-platinum sales, record-setting CMA award wins and a laundry list of other accolades during their 20-year run together. They went separate ways four years ago to pursue solo musical careers, among other ventures, but never lost touch. And today, they announced they&apos;ll share the stage again for a series of shows at Las Vegas&apos; Caesar&apos;s Palace, co-headlining with their longtime pal and sometime duet partner, Reba McEntire.
Twelve dates for the country legends&apos; show, dubbed Together in Vegas, were revealed today, with more on the horizon. Tickets for select shows in June, July and December 2015 will go on sale tomorrow (December 4th), with seats starting at $59.50 apiece.
McEntire&apos;s history with Brooks and Dunn runs deep. The guys were her opening act in 1992, and her joint tour with the duo made its largely sold-out run from 1997 — 1999. She sang with them on the chart-topping ""If You See Him (If You See Her),"" as well as the 2009 hit, ""Cowgirls Don&apos;t Cry."" It&apos;s been reported that McEntire was the one who convinced her friends to reunite for the Vegas gig.
It&apos;s not likely today&apos;s announcement means Brooks and Dunn will record new music together. Dunn hinted this week that he&apos;s inked a record deal with Nash Icon, the new label whose flagship artist is McEntire. Both Dunn and his on-again partner released post-breakup solo albums, each under the Sony Music Nashville umbrella. Brooks also continues to host the syndicated American Country Countdown radio show, along with dabbling in film and television, and running his vineyard south of Nashville.
Caesar&apos;s Palace was previously home to Celine Dion, who announced in August she was ending her residency there to spend more time with her family. In addition to McEntire and Brooks and Dunn, the venue will add to its star power with another major headliner to be announced in January.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204885.27/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326075019-20190326101019-00379.warc.gz

On Thursday, they announced the official track listing for the album, due out April 5th, and posted the new version of ""My Next Broken Heart"" featuring Jon Pardi.

With its stomping, two-stepping beat and sizzling Telecaster licks, ""My Next Broken Heart"" was made for the honky-tonks. Pardi takes the lead in the first verse, then supplies some low harmonies to support Ronnie Dunn's sublime voice. They momentarily shift gears with the top of each chorus, as the drummer changes to a half-time beat before hopping right back to the regular rhythm. Brooks & Dunn originally recorded the song for their 1991 debut album Brand New Man and it went on to become their second Number One.

Elsewhere on Reboot, present-day stars get a turn at singing their favorites. In addition to previously released tracks featuring Combs and Kane Brown, the album includes ""Neon Moon"" with Grammy Album of the Year winner Kacey Musgraves (which she's been known to sing live), ""Hard Workin' Man"" with Brothers Osborne, ""You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone"" with Ashley McBryde and ""Boot Scootin' Boogie"" with Midland. Dan Huff produced the album, with Musgraves co-producing her track alongside him.

In addition to resuming their Las Vegas residency with Reba McEntire on June 26th, Brooks & Dunn will also play the Houston Rodeo on February 27th.

Earlier this week, Worsham and Osborne set their sights on another Southern-rock band — re-creating the Allman Brothers' ""Whipping Post"" onstage at the Sylvee in Madison, Wisconsin.

Currently opening select shows with the Osbornes, Worsham joined the band for a blazing take on the Allmans' 1969 jam, a song that became a signature of the group — and notably longer — after its inclusion on 1971's live double LP At Fillmore East. Here, John Osborne and Worsham trade both licks and vocals, with Osborne singing the gritty verses and Worsham wailing the ""sometimes I feel"" chorus. It's the musicianship of the longtime friends (Osborne and Worsham once played together in the band KingBilly) that elevates the collaboration, however. Listen to Worsham's soulful solo at the 3:45 mark and Osborne's screeching fills at 5:45.

The ""Whipping Post"" cover is just the latest onstage highlight for the Osbornes.
