Their major-label debut piles up techno beats, Afrikaans lyrics and choruses that sound like warped schoolyard chants, peaking with the intense and addictive ""Enter the Ninja"" — whose machine-gun rhymes and surreal singsong hooks suggest Eminem&apos;s ""Lose Yourself"" on crank. Elsewhere, Die Antwoord get stuck in mediocre porn-rap, rhyming about ejaculating in champagne glasses and chicks with dicks. The overall effect is sort of like watching freak-show performers who haven&apos;t figured out how to maximize their talents.

Rather than coast on his formula, though, Mustard spends much of his debut album making hard-hitting, old-school West Coast hip-hop. Famous friends (Lil Wayne, 2 Chainz) and emerging MCs stop by for songs that suggest modern versions of Eazy-E&apos;s ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" (""Ghetto Tales"") and Too $hort&apos;s freaky storytelling (""Face Down"").

4,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/15-big-ones-205936/,"We&apos;re still singing that same song,"" the Beach Boys chime on 15 Big Ones, their long awaited new album, and a check proves that the personnel hasn&apos;t changed since 1962. But the same song as ""Surfin&apos;""? Hardly. Today, the reference point is Gregorian chant, and the rock is for the ages. Even the familiar faces are misleading. Brian Wilson, the group&apos;s absentee genius, hasn&apos;t toured with them since 1964; the last Top Ten hit he wrote and produced for them came in 1966.
But that chronology only tells half a story. In 1974, Capitol Records released Endless Summer, an anthology of Beach Boys material from the ""Surfin&apos; U.S.A.""/""Help Me Rhonda"" era, circa 1962-65. It went on to sell over a million copies, spawning Spirit of America, a successful followup. Meanwhile, the Beach Boys once again became one of the biggest concert draws in the United States, largely on the strength of a tight set that increasingly emphasized the surf and car oldies. Unfortunately, the once and future real-life Beach Boys haven&apos;t been able to cut a commercial new record. In fact, for the past three years, they haven&apos;t been able to cut much of anything.
The real enigma has been Brian. By 1976, the man who had authored and produced all those early hits and much of their best later work, from Friends to Holland, was less a vital creative voice than a mute object of speculation and gossip. What few tidbits surfaced seemed equivocal: Brian&apos;s Christmas record for the Beach Boys in 1974, ""Child of Winter,"" was extremely odd, and his production and singing on California Music&apos;s 1975 remake of ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love"" also sounded, well, off.
This context is crucial, for a lot is riding on 15 Big Ones. It is the Beach Boys&apos; first studio album since Holland in 1972. It is Brian&apos;s first solo Beach Boys production since Wild Honey in 1967. Most of all, it is the album that the group and Reprise hope will put the contemporary band back on top of the charts, in the same league with their former selves.
Imagine Brian&apos;s situation. Trapped by the potent popular chimera of eternal summertime fun he himself created, obsessed by fears of failing melodic gifts and forced to compete with his own best work, unwilling or unable any longer to trust his instincts, uncertain whether his reflective understanding of the music may not cripple the carefree rock & roll he has had success with in the past, Brian (reluctantly?) comes out of semiretirement to take control of the first Beach Boys project in over three years, submits to interviews and waits, anxiously, one assumes, for the popular verdict.
The result, 15 Big Ones, includes eight rock classics, six new ones and one Beach Boys ""oldie,"" ""Susie Cincinnati,"" that dates from 1970 (it first appeared as the flip to the BBs&apos; Reprise debut, ""Add Some Music to Your Day""). In explaining the paucity of new material — the sine qua non of a genuine comeback, one would have thought — Brian has been blunt: ""It&apos;s hard to come up with original material... .""
The album&apos;s opener, Chuck Berry&apos;s ""Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll Music,"" sets the mood. A methodical rendition, garnished by lugubrious organ fills and lumbering fuzz guitar, the cut at first sounds lazy, although its brittle surface cuts through on AM radio. Rather than evoking ""Fun, Fun, Fun,"" the record recalls the jaded posturing of the latter-day Rolling Stones — as if to echo, ""It&apos;s only rock &apos;n&apos; roll, but I like it, like it, yes I do."" The bands protest too much.
The ultimate emptiness of this compulsion to rock around the clock — picture a man condemned to life imprisonment on a Ferris wheel — is only underlined by the album&apos;s last track, a positively chilling rendition of ""Just Once in My Life,"" the Righteous Brothers/Phil Spector hit. Brian&apos;s arrangement lovingly sketches in the song&apos;s original setting, but the vocals are something else again. Sounding rather like a suicide before the plunge, Carl Wilson wobbles around the opening lines: ""There&apos;s a lot of things I want, a lot of things that I&apos;d like to be."" When Brian enters, he sings believably, pathetically, ""I&apos;ve given up on schemes, &apos;cause every one fell through/I&apos;ve given up so many things, don&apos;t ask me to give up on you."" Wavering off-pitch delivery and all, this is one of the most affecting vocals Brian has ever done, right up there with ""In My Room"" and ""Caroline, No."" But is this the key to mass success? Maybe if cadavers threw pajama parties.
The other oldies are equally spooky. ""Talk to Me"" might pass as psychotherapy for ether addicts. With its mysterious interpolation of ""Tallahassee Lassie,"" this cut sounds like it belongs on ""Mount Vernon and Fairway,"" Brian&apos;s fairy tale ""bonus"" on Holland.
In the past, the Beach Boys have made some great versions of rock classics, crowned by ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love"" (on Shut Down-Vol. 2) and ""I Can Hear Music"" (on 20/20) with their stunning a cappella breaks. But it would be a mistake to compare these records with the oldies on 15 Big Ones. The earlier remakes involved songs Brian or Carl simply felt like covering. The new remakes, by contrast, involve songs Brian has grasped at to help break his writer&apos;s block. He treats each of them as a valuable clue to the secret of rock & roll, as if by taking these cherished songs and memories apart and piecing them back together again he might recover a mastery of their magic for himself.
The sloppy vocals and hallucinatory instrumental are all part of Brian&apos;s strategy to ""get back."" (Brian: ""I love the old stuff that we did better than the new stuff. It was simple in its crude form, and I liked that."") Very few of the versions even pretend fidelity to the originals. They are all marked by Brian&apos;s marvelous looniness and his ear for melody, which has never failed him, whatever he may fear: just listen to the saxophone chorale opening ""Blueberry Hill,"" and then Brian&apos;s own demented, soulful vocal counterpoint on ""Chapel of Love,"" or any of his new songs, for that matter.
Brian&apos;s originals, five in all, are of a piece with the oldies. Again, none of them attempt a straightforward update of the ""Beach Boys sound."" ""It&apos;s O.K.,"" inevitably the next single from the album, comes closest to summoning the obligatory sunshine (""Gotta go to it/Gotta go through it/Gotta get with it"") and it crackles with concise authority. But the bleating organ behind that chorus, the ambiguity of ""gotta,"" both give the game away: ""It&apos;s O.K. to get out there and have some fun."" Who are they trying to convince, anyway? (Brian confessed recently that water has always scared him.)
Perhaps in a fit of congenital eccentricity, Brian has turned his other songs on 15 Big Ones into three-minute autobiographical schnapps reminiscent of his work on 1968&apos;s Friends: ""Had to Phone Ya"" sounds like ""Busy Doin&apos; Nothin&apos;"" revisited, and ""Back Home"" echoes, in the same ungainly way, all the wholesome virtues extoled in ""When a Man Needs a Woman."" But where Friends reflected a kind of oblivious domesticity, 15 Big Ones expresses a troubled sensibility fighting to regain its equilibrium. And when Brian sings that he&apos;s going ""back home to that farm I remember,"" where he&apos;ll milk cows, feed chickens and eat breakfast alone, it&apos;s hard not to grant the man his absurd vision of bliss.
It all adds up to a compulsive, tentative album that almost sounds unfinished — and this from a band that could win a guaranteed ride to the top with recycled formulas. Now we&apos;ll have to wait and see, although ""Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll Music"" looks like the band&apos;s first Top Ten single since ""Good Vibrations.""
This much, I think, is clear: in a period when even our best bands traffic in bland proficiency (think only of the Rolling Stones&apos; Black and Blue or Steely Dan&apos;s The Royal Scam), 15 Big Ones relentlessly exhibits, in poignant, almost embarrassing detail, the foibles, fantasies and frustrated ambitions of Brian Wilson, the man behind America&apos;s greatest white rock band. It is the most idiosyncratic — and flaky — record I have heard in some time, and it fascinates me. Like Friends, its clearest predecessor in their oeuvre, 15 Big Ones will be treasured by longstanding Beach Boys addicts, even if it confounds a new audience hungry for summer reruns.
But Brian deserves the last word. ""There&apos;s a lotta different ways to go. One way is very mental, trusting in your mind; the second is kinda going with your instincts and the third would be force. If the first two fail, the last sets in — but that works too."" All right, but what about next time?",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203448.17/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324124545-20190324150545-00535.warc.gz
5,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/18-181331/,"Moby may look like an unlikely candidate for the gig, but by now he&apos;s the face of modern music. It&apos;s probably just because he likes everything. Too catholic in his tastes to pass for a true dance-floor DJ, he finds his real artistic vocation as the home DJ, the guy obsessively making his own mix tapes (or burning his own mix CDs) and foisting them on his friends. The payoff: his 1999 classic Play, a deeply eccentric and garbled spiritual statement that nonetheless smashed through music-biz boundaries to find new audiences all over the world, eventually selling almost 10 million copies and gracing more TV commercials than Mr. Whipple. Jumping off from Fatboy Slim&apos;s ""Praise You,"" Moby took ghostly old voices from blues and gospel folkways and remixed them into seductive new dance music. You had to worry that the sequel would beat the formula into the ground, turning ancient spirituals into ad jingles: ""Nobody Knows the Arby&apos;s I&apos;ve Seen,"" ""Nike&apos;s Blood Never Failed Me Yet,"" ""Colonel Sanders Gonna Make Up My Dying Bed"" or ""Oh, Lawdy, I&apos;m Not Gonna Pay a Lot for This Muffler.""
In addition to everything else it was, Play was a mess. Everybody remembers it for the blues-gospel techno pastiche of highlights such as ""Natural Blues"" and ""Honey,"" but they added up to only one-third or so of the album. The rest of Play veered from somber New Age goop to metal-guitar blare to goth gloom to silly Paula Abdul-style mall disco (the freak hit ""South Side""). That&apos;s the way Moby works: His 1996 Animal Rights was packaged as his metal move, but it was dominated mostly by such spacey keyboard doodles as ""Love Song for My Mom"" (and why hasn&apos;t Hallmark bought up that one yet?). Messes are Moby&apos;s thing, and the disjunct segue is his signature groove. So 18 is neither a retread of Play nor a departure from it. It&apos;s pop music the way Moby has always heard it: a frantic dance of different sounds and styles, banging into the wall a time or two but hitting sublimely beautiful highs along the way.
On 18, Moby turns up the vocals — only a handful of tracks are old-school instrumentals. Understandably, he spends much of the album trying to re-create the gospel flavor of Play, but all the soulful diva action gets tiresome after a while. Despite gorgeous guest shots from Jennifer Price (""In This World"") and the Shining Light Gospel Choir (""In My Heart""), there&apos;s too much vocal holleration and not enough songwriting to go around. The strongest tunes on 18 are the ones that hold bigger surprises, especially the beatific New Wave space oddity ""We Are All Made of Stars."" It sounds like a title that Ultravox or the Comsat Angels or somebody would have used in 1982, but it soars over a New Order-like guitar groove and Moby&apos;s modest voice. He sounds like an earnest young cleric scattering blessings over his flock, singing a love song to his new mass audience: ""People, they come together/And people, they fall apart/No one can stop us now/Because we are all made of stars.""
""Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday)"" is another coup, a funk collage sampling breathy vocals from Seventies disco kitten Sylvia Robinson, of ""Pillow Talk"" fame. And since Moby&apos;s birthday is September 11th, you&apos;re free to read whatever symbolism you like into Robinson&apos;s nostalgic sigh for the day before. ""Jam for the Ladies,"" featuring MC Lyte and Angie Stone, is a decent idea that never gets off the ground. But Azure Ray lends a frail, lovely vocal to the ballad ""Great Escape,"" foreshadowing ""Harbour,"" an amazing Unrest-style guitar drone that guest-stars - are you sitting down, Your Holiness? — Sinead O&apos;Connor, who hasn&apos;t sounded this awake since her 1995 Shane MacGowan duet ""Haunted.""
As for Moby&apos;s own voice, the guy no longer sings like a DJ. He&apos;s learned about vocal projection the way he&apos;s learned about album pacing, so he comes on stronger than ever as a singer, especially when he shows off his new deep-throat Iggy growl in ""Extreme Ways."" Techno might remain Moby&apos;s starting point, but his impolitic insistence on stroking his pop-star ambitions, however many of his anonymity-minded techno allies it may have cost him, has been good for his music, forcing him to master the pop virtues of melody, variety and rhythmic drive. As a result, he remains one of the few artists around who thinks big enough to make a record with the emotional reach of 18. But as he already proved years before he broke through to the designer-sneaker masses, he&apos;s committed to the lifelong pursuit of the perfect mix tape.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203842.71/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325072024-20190325094024-00219.warc.gz
6,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/18-original-sun-greatest-hits-198457/,"p>Nowadays, Jerry Lee Lewis is a respected country and western star, instant success following each release. Actually, he&apos;s always been country. But he hasn&apos;t always been such a well respected man.
 
These two albums of re-releases return us to the Fifties, when Jerry Lee was the Mick Jagger of his day. If his (for then) outlandishly long blond hair, wild clothing, and frenzied act didn&apos;t aggravate the public sufficiently, he made up for it in other ways. He married three times before his twenty-third birthday; the last marriage, to his thirteen year-old cousin, came before his second divorce was final and he found himself tossed out of England as a result. Headlining several of the late Alan Freed&apos;s cross-country rock circuses, he was crucified by the press. And when Dick Clark brought rock to prime time TV, Lewis was the opening night star. Singing ""Great Balls of Fire"" and ""Breathless,"" the Pete Townshend of the piano discarded the stool, pounded the keys with his elbows, and transformed himself into a golden mass of perspiration. Jerry Lee was then at his peak, but the public wasn&apos;t ready for him, and he soon faded. His style, both on stage and off, was part of his downfall.
It&apos;s ""Jerry Lee Lewis and his Pumping Piano,"" as the labels of his old Sun 45s once boasted; a distinctive vocal style, a country sound, a crazed piano, a guitar break, an occasional sax. His biggest hits are here; ""Whole Lotta Shakin&apos; Going On,"" ""Great Balls of Fire,"" ""Breathless,"" and the equally good but lesser known ""High School Confidential."" They remain among the best examples of pure rock. The other numbers are straight C&W or rhythm and blues, all reflecting the musical flavor of the Fifties. We have a ""Teen-Age Letter,"" a ""Break-Up,"" and ""Save the Last Dance for Me.""
Many of the lyrics and arrangements are, of course, antiquated. People simply don&apos;t sing about ""boppin&apos; at the high school hop"" or dancin&apos; shoes anymore. And background ""doo-wahs"" are scarce today. Yet the result overshadows these distractions.
Lewis&apos; voice, that slow southern drawl filled with power, urgency, sureness, and sexuality, is the same sort of voice that most of the early English groups tried to recreate, and it is still the voice of today. The white use of black pronunciation (""Great Balls of Fire,"" ""Little Queenie"") which Lewis carried on in true country tradition is now more common than ever. His fascination with boogie (""Lewis Boogie,"" ""What&apos;d I Say"") reflects a knowledge of a form that many people today feel they have just uncovered.
""Whole Lotta Shakin&apos; Going On"" and ""Great Balls of Fire"" speak for themselvies as Lewis&apos; own contribution to the permanent history of rock, and ""High School Confidential"" is beautiful. Here he is, ordering his woman to open her door and get her dancing shoes before the juke box blows a fuse. The music stops, he sings; it stops, he sings. The song is so fast it stuns, the voice so urgent it spells emergency. So what if they&apos;re going to a high school hop? It could be anywhere, and it could be any fuse getting ready to blow. He also does Chuck Berry&apos;s ""Little Queenie"" and Barrett Strong&apos;s ""Money,"" long before the English ""discovered"" them for white audiences. Jerry Lee knew back when.
Again, while millions are only now finding country music, Lewis always knew it. The C&W numbers also show shapes of things to come, as well as what had been. ""Move on Down the Line"" reminds me of the putdown songs of the Stones. ""Fools Like Me"" and ""I&apos;ll Make it All Up to You"" are country, but like much country, they are also the blues. And everyone tries his hand at the blues today. Especially with Hank Williams&apos; ""You Win Again"" do we see why Lewis is a top country figure today. The music is not as smooth as country&apos;s Top Forty, nor is the singing. But the beginnings are there, the feeling if you want to get corny.
For me, however, ""Breathless"" remains his masterpiece. The piano is pumping, the voice is raw Louisiana, and only the tired adjective ""frantic"" can describe the song&apos;s total effect. The gasp for air each time he confesses he&apos;s breathless, the substitution of squeals and groans for words, the half-talk, half-sing style; everything is perfect. There is a bit of ""Breathless"" in most good rock today. Only the ""good-ness grac-ci-ous"" of ""Great Balls of Fire"" matches the creativity of this song.
Lewis is not a great singer, a great musician, nor does he write much. He is a great interpreter. He takes the words and the music that others have put on paper and makes them his. Not many of today&apos;s groups have this ability. The best write their own material. The others don&apos;t last very long. It is this ability that makes ""Breathless,"" ""Great Balls of Fire,"" and ""Whole Lotta Shakin&apos;"" great.
Like a few of the other rock stars of his time, like Presley, the Everlys, and Roy Orbison, he unwittingly foresaw the future. The forecasting is one of the remarkable aspects of these albums. His rock numbers still stand up. His country flavor is again the big thing. The blues, the boogie, the monologue; it&apos;s all here. Those who saw him in the earlier days will recall one of rock&apos;s wildest, yet best performers. A wild white singer, Mick Jagger with a piano. Those who never saw him can visualize it all by listening to these numbers, songs running from self-pity to gloating overbearance to simple statements of fact. And Jerry Lee was a revolutionary before it became fashionable. He just did what he thought was right.
A few of the songs on the albums are truly great. Most of them are good. There are a few duds, which is remarkable considering that Sun probably scrounged through their files to find enough material for the set.
Lewis is now enjoying a revival among rock listeners as well as among country fans, but he&apos;s only doing what he&apos;s always done; a bit more subdued, but basically the same thing. Hearing these albums won&apos;t conjure up visions of him singing ""What Made Milwaukee Famous Has Made a Loser Out of Me."" But it&apos;s so very easy to close your eyes and be back in the balcony of the Brooklyn Fox seeing Alan Freed introduce the one and only Jerry Lee Lewis.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202704.58/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323000443-20190323022443-00336.warc.gz

9,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/1989-90808/,"When Taylor Swift decides to do something, the girl really knows how to overdo it. So on her fifth album, when she indulges her crush on Eighties synth-pop, she goes full blast, spending most of the album trying to turn herself into the Pet Shop Boys. 1989 is a drastic departure – only a couple of tracks feature her trademark tear-stained guitar. But she&apos;s still Taylor Swift, which means she&apos;s dreaming bigger and oversharing louder than anyone else in the game. And she still has way too many feelings for the kind of dudes who probably can&apos;t even spell ""feelings.""

Swift has already written enough great songs for two or three careers. Red, from 2012, was her Purple Rain, a sprawling I-am-the-cosmos epic with disco banjos and piano ballads and dubstep drops. But as every Eighties pop star knew, you don&apos;t follow one epic with another – instead, you surprise everybody with a quick-change experiment. So rather than trying to duplicate the wide reach of Red, she focuses on one aspect of her sound for a whole album – a very Prince thing to do.
Max Martin produced seven of these 13 songs, and his beats provide the Saturday-night-whatever soundtrack as Swift sings about the single life in the big old city she always dreamed about. In ""Welcome to New York,"" she finds herself in a place where ""you can want who you want/Boys and boys, and girls and girls."" She hits cruise mode on the floor in ""Blank Space"" (""I can make the bad guys good for the weekend"") and the hilariously titled ""Style,"" where she swoons, ""You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye.""
The best moments come toward the end, when Swift shakes up the concept. ""How You Get the Girl"" mixes up the best of her old and new tricks, as she strums an acoustic guitar aggressively over Martin&apos;s expert disco surge. ""This Love"" brings back her most simpatico producer, Nathan Chapman, for the kind of tune that they were just starting to call a ""power ballad"" in 1989. (The precise equivalent would be Bon Jovi&apos;s ""I&apos;ll Be There for You."") On the killer finale, ""Clean,"" English singer Imogen Heap adds ethereal backup sighs to Swift&apos;s electro melancholy (""You&apos;re still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can&apos;t wear anymore"").
If there&apos;s nothing as grandiose as ""All Too Well"" or ""Dear John"" or ""Enchanted,"" that&apos;s because there wasn&apos;t meant to be. 1989 sets the record for fewest adjectives (and lowest romantic body count) on a Swift album. Most of the songs hover above the three-minute mark, which is a challenge for Tay – she&apos;s always been a songwriter who can spend five minutes singing about a freaking scarf and still make every line hit like a haymaker. But if you&apos;re into math, note that the three best songs here – ""How You Get the Girl,"" ""This Love,"" ""Clean"" – are the three that crash past four minutes. This is still an artist who likes to let it rip. Deeply weird, feverishly emotional, wildly enthusiastic, 1989 sounds exactly like Taylor Swift, even when it sounds like nothing she&apos;s ever tried before. And yes, she takes it to extremes.

10,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/1999-2-111958/,"After the critical success of his Dirty Mind LP in 1980 and the subsequent notoriety of last year&apos;s Controversy, Prince, at the tender age of twenty-two, has become the inspiration for a growing renegade school of Sex & Funk & Rock & Roll that includes his fellow Minneapolis hipsters Andre Cymone, the Time and Vanity 6. Yet regardless of the jive that he hath wrought, Prince himself does more than merely get down and talk dirty. Beneath all his kinky propositions resides a tantalizing utopian philosophy of humanism through hedonism that suggests once you&apos;ve broken all the rules, you&apos;ll find some real values. All you&apos;ve got to do is act naturally.
Prince&apos;s quasi-religious faith in this vision of social freedom through sensual anarchy makes even his most preposterous utterances sound earnest. On the title track of 1999, which opens this two-LP set of artfully arranged synthesizer pop, Prince ponders no less than the future of the entire planet, shaking his booty disapprovingly at the threat of nuclear annihilation. Although that one exuberant dance-along raises more big questions than Prince can answer on the other three and a half sides combined, the entire enterprise is charged with his unflagging will to survive — and a feisty determination to eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow, given the daily news, we may die.
Before ""1999"" whooshes into life, Prince assumes an electronically altered, basso-profundo voice and impersonates the imagined authoritative tone of God himself, creator of libidos as well as souls, prefacing the song&apos;s Judgment Day scenario with this reassurance: ""Don&apos;t worry, I won&apos;t hurt you. I only want you to have some fun."" This intro serves Prince well, since 1999 lacks the tight focus of Dirty Mind, his best and most concise LP, which had the feel of emotionally volatile autobiography disguised as vividly descriptive sexual fantasy. Yet the new album doesn&apos;t fall prey to the conceptual confusion that plagued the second side of Controversy, during which Prince raced from politics to passion, funk groove to rock blitz, as if there weren&apos;t room enough for all his inspiration. This time there is, and then some.
Prince develops eleven songs, basically a single album&apos;s worth of material, over the four sides of 1999, with each side comprising two or three extended tracks. Both discs are distinguished by palpably individual moods — the first contains the funkiest, most playful cuts, while the second is made up of slower, more introspective pieces. Two tracks, ""D.M.S.R."" and ""All the Critics Love U in New York,"" qualify as unadulterated filler, and gone are any attempts at the classic three-minute pop song — Dirty Mind&apos;s ""When You Were Mine"" was the last word on that, I guess. On 1999, size counts.
Having graduated in record time from postdisco garage rock to high-tech studio wizardry, Prince works like a colorblind technician who&apos;s studied both Devo and Afrika Bambaataa and the Soul Sonic Force, keeping the songs constantly kinetic with an inventive series of shocks and surprises. As ""1999"" proceeds, for example, he geometrically increases the overdubs until there&apos;s a roomful of Princes partying almost out of bounds, then deftly brings it down to rhythm guitar and percussion while a childlike chorus asks, ""Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?"" until — boom! — the groove disappears at its hottest.
Prince&apos;s funniest and slyest effects are reserved for ""Let&apos;s Pretend We&apos;re Married,"" a string of offhandedly vulgar suggestions transformed with the most basic tools into a quintessential Princeian comic-erotic epic. He first employs minimal but propulsive synth riffs to conjure the atmosphere of a computer-age arcade, pickup bar or, maybe, a space-station lounge. Then he chooses his most angelic falsetto to lure a prospective partner (""My girl&apos;s gone and she don&apos;t care at all/And if she did...""), suddenly switching to his gruffest lower register to complete the couplet: ""...So what? C&apos;mon, baby, let&apos;s ball!"" Between his ever nastier entreaties, a breezy non sequitur of a chorus (""Ooh we sha sha coo coo yeah/All the hippies sing together"") rushes by like a snatch of transmission from another galaxy, until most everything drops out except a pulsing synthetic bass and Prince himself, desperately aroused, liberally sprinkling his come-ons with the f word. But before his pleas fade into lonely space, he pulls out one last gimmick, a phalanx of cloned voices testifying that he is indeed the Prince of Uptown U.S.A. in a rap wildly mixing the sacred and profane: ""Haven&apos;t you heard about me? It&apos;s true/I change the rules and do what I want to do/I&apos;m in love with God, he&apos;s the only way/&apos;Cause you and I know we gotta die someday/You might think I&apos;m crazy, and you&apos;re probably right/But I&apos;m gonna have fun every motherfucking night....""
1999 reaches its climax, however, with Prince&apos;s shortest and sweetest offering, ""Free,"" which concludes the moody, dub-style third side without any electronic pyrotechnics whatsoever. Prince steps from behind the clanking machinery like a sentimental Wizard of Oz to remind us that ""if you take your life for granted, your beating heart will go."" More important, he restates his utopian vision in the most inspirational terms, as if all the battles had been won and he could finally be a lover, not a fighter. ""Free"" reeks of skewed patriotism, describing the state of the union as much as a state of mind, its march-of-history grandiosity recalling Patti Smith&apos;s ""Broken Flag."" Like Smith, Prince is not afraid to be misunderstood — or wrong.
But I think Prince can separate a vision of life from a version of it, as the disturbing postscript ""Lady Cab Driver"" illustrates. A sequel to Controversy&apos;s ""Annie Christian,"" in which Prince tried to duck fate by living ""my life in taxicabs,"" ""Lady Cab Driver"" finds him bidding his cabbie to roll up the windows and take him away because ""trouble winds are blowin&apos; hard and/I don&apos;t know if I can last."" But midway through the song, the pain of both personal and public injustice wells up inside him, bursting out in an angry litany of verbal thrusts — ""This is for the cab you have to drive for no money at all/This is for why I wasn&apos;t born like my brother, handsome and tall/This is for politicians who are bored and believe in war"" — suggesting an ugly backseat orgy of sex or violence. Prince, the lover, not the fighter, then retreats to the demilitarized zone of the bedroom, where he can safely bid us goodbye under the guise of ""International Lover.""
A natural goodbye for Prince, but hardly as powerful as the final moments of Dirty Mind, when, during the antidraft ""Partyup,"" he challenged, ""All lies, no truth/Is it fair to kill the youth?"" before defiantly commanding, ""Party up!"" Just as Prince must face the contradiction of creating music that gracefully dissolves racial and stylistic boundaries yet fits comfortably into no one&apos;s playlist, he must also decide whether he can ""dance my life away"" when everybody has a bomb. All you need is love?",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203865.15/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325092147-20190325114147-00525.warc.gz
11,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/20-20-187920/,"The Beach Boys are one of the stranger phenomena of rock. In 1963, they were responsible for some of the best rock by whites before the Beatles. They created a style, now dated, more sociologically than musically. The style has altered (improved, even), though not as much as the music itself.
The current album is a collage of several different phases of the group&apos;s career. ""Do It Again"" is the best California rock song they&apos;ve done since ""Help Me, Rhonda,"" an authentic lyric, fine hand-clap drum, lush in a more disciplined way than on Pet Sounds. ""I Can Hear Music"" has an interesting alto chorus, a balance of strong vocals rather than, as on most of the other cuts, a solo with backing. Almost, but not quite, tight enough. ""Bluebirds Over the Mountain"" is distinguished by subtle, even humorous, but nonetheless driving piano (here, as throughout their later stuff, Brian&apos;s piano is the central instrument, rather than guitar). The chorus here is nasal, and is a disadvantage. The ""psychedelic"" guitar is seemingly out of place, but undeniably good.
""Be With Me,"" by Dennis Wilson, uses woodwinds effectively, with heavy emphasis on brass that is, but for a couple of notes, quite tasteful. Again, this is reminiscent of Pet Sounds, where the major influence on Brian seemed to be Motown — a creative influence that, however, also fit right in with the temptation to over-sentimentalize the music. The fadeout on this piece is the highlight, a Space Odyssey-like distortion of strings and vocals. ""All I want to Do,"" with fine piano and a simple but perfect bass line, uses guitar better than anywhere else on the album. The vocal is, ultimately, convincing. ""The Nearest Faraway Place"" is an alternately interesting and grotesquely over-done instrumental.
The second side has the record&apos;s two best pieces, one being the first band, ""Cotton Fields"" (that ""Cotton Fields""), on which piano gives depth to harpsichord, the vocal is superb, the arrangement tight, and echo used better and more tastefully than by anyone since Phil Spector.
""I Went to Sleep"" is not rock at all, but pop well-arranged. ""Time to Get Alone"" resolves the contradictions between pop and rock, with a real balancing of vocals tied together by simple but effective drums; violin, the most abused of all rock instruments, is employed with restraint. ""Never Learn Not to Love"" is a fine vocal, though the material itself is an uncertain mixture of pop and soul influences. ""Our Prayer"" is a nice prayer, but undemanding.
""Cabinessence,"" the last cut on the second side, is one of the finest things Brian has ever done, a product of the Smiley Smile collaboration with Parks, whose extraordinary gift it is to make a cliche grow into a world: ""Lost and found you still remain there/I&apos;ll nind a meadow filled with reindeer —/I&apos;ll build you a home on the range."" The totally orchestrated cacophony was an innovation in rock when they used it in Smiley Smile, and is still done here better than anywhere else. Piano imitates ukelele, and the solo vocal is gentle, but brilliant.
A good album, flawed mainly by a lack of direction (a sense of direction being last evident in Wild Honey), more a collection than a whole.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201885.28/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319032352-20190319054352-00399.warc.gz
12,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/20-granite-creek-182307/,"Well it&apos;s sure nice to see the Grape have cheered up since their Fillmore East fiasco of the past June. It was to be their big comeback and in practice they played the best live set ever performed anytime anywhere and then when the audience was there they stank. Audiences can be a pain in the ass I guess and this album proves that without an audience and with all the members of the original Grape aboard ship they can outdo Truly Fine Citizen with their eyes closed.
The best indication of an improvement in disposition is the way they&apos;re doing ""Ode to the Man at the End of the Bar"" now. Mosley a great singer used to do it sort of slow and melancholy. Now it&apos;s fast and almost happy and either way it&apos;s one of the swellest drinking songs in the history of annaldom. All about how this guy&apos;s been sitting there drinking and losing his keys and getting a new glass after the one he had got broken and he pukes and stuff like that. You know the story, it&apos;s happened to you, it&apos;s happened to me, it&apos;s happened to all of us.
But we haven&apos;t all been as lucky as the guy in Peter Lewis&apos; ""Goin&apos; Down to Texas."" He&apos;s going with the girl that he just met, they&apos;re gonna see her family in her new Corvette! That&apos;s all right. I know you can dig it, you wish it was you, right? That&apos;s if you&apos;re a guy. If you&apos;re a lady you wish it was your Corvette, am I right? Either way it&apos;s a great song.
The longest terrific amazing cut is also the only Skip Spence cut on the album. Skip&apos;s never done a bad cut and if you count all the cuts on his own Our that&apos;s an awful lot of cuts, good, bad or otherwise. And they even happen to be all good and so&apos;s ""Chinese Song"" which has him on koto. There was once a koto cut on an early Association album but this one&apos;s got it beat by more than a league. It&apos;s kind of reminiscent, of that thing on the second Country Joe album with the really slow notes and you keep wondering why it&apos;s so slow and what&apos;s gonna happen next. What happens in this one is tension after tension plus some hoodoo and voodoo. And no singing, not a single word, a big surprise when Mr. Spence is involved indeed.
Surprises are fun and the Grape&apos;s got the biggest one of all up its sleeve. Which is: they&apos;re the only San Francisco band to survive the whole last couple of whatever, and that includes the Dead, buster. They let themselves fly off the handle lots of times like all boys should and now here they are back in one piece(s). All made possible by temporary total disintegration. In fact constant temporary total disintegration.
It would be a real treat if someone got ahold of Bud Scoppa&apos;s real tentacle of a tape of the Grape&apos;s pre-Fillmore practice session and put it out as the companion for this one. But even without Bud&apos;s tape this is still the humdingerest Kinney product since Sticky Fingers.

14,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/21-at-33-184552/,"We&apos;re now into the fifth year of the Elton John crisis, and frankly some of us here on the Elton watch are getting worried. Ever since 1975, when the anti-John backlash set in and the piano pumper&apos;s finest album, Rock of the Westies, only went umpteen-platinum instead of his usual quadribillion, Elton has sounded confused, bitter, exhausted.
Efforts to reenter John into the mainstream of things failed: Blue Moves (1976) seemed like a smart idea at the time — a double-LP sulk at the height of such psychonarcissisms as est. A Single Man (1978)? Well, you know how rattled Elton was by that punk-rock business. It took a couple of years to get his head straight. And even we, the best fans and advisers a guy could have, had to admit that the Thom Bell Sessions and Victim of Love (both 1979) were miscalculations — nice disco exploitation moves made way too late.
Which is why so much is riding on 21 at 33. (Memo: Ask John what the hell he means by that title. When it was first announced, I thought he was going to go Elvis Costello one better and put twenty-one tunes on the record, but there are only nine.) On the surface, Elton seems happier. He&apos;s toured, he&apos;s made up with Bernie Taupin and he&apos;s writing with Tom Robinson. Everything looks good, right?
The album&apos;s first side is okay. ""Little Jeannie"" is a sweet midtempo ballad, with a lot of the old ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" wistfulness. ""Sartorial Eloquence,"" written with Robinson, doesn&apos;t have much of a melody, but we can spare a song to establish the fact that our man&apos;s got a good vocabulary. Smart PR, you know. The two numbers with Bernie, ""Chasing the Crown"" and ""Two Rooms at the End of the World,"" are the neatest, most cogent rockers that Taupin and John have done in a long time. I particularly like it when Elton becomes the conscience of Anglo-American relations in ""Chasing the Crown"": ""I saw the tea float in Boston."" Great stuff.
But the whole thing falls apart on the second side. 21 at 33 becomes a blatant — kind of pathetic, if the truth be known — recitation of all of John&apos;s lurking fears. Who in the world let Elton and Bernie put this song about — boy, it&apos;s hot in here, isn&apos;t it? — cocaine as side two&apos;s opener? And to follow that with ""Dear God""! None of us doubt John&apos;s faith, but I&apos;m afraid that a born-again Elton — coming so soon after the hair transplant and all — is almost too much to comprehend. The ears boggle.
The rest of the record is just slow, dull and blatant. ""Never Gonna Fall in Love Again"" might be about a girl, but you can&apos;t fool the kids out there: they know that Elton John is talking about never again being as loose and wild and comfortable with his fame as he once was in the mid-Seventies. (Even if he&apos;s practically begging to get back into the Top Ten in the next track. ""Take Me Back."") As for the last cut, ""Give Me the Love"" — well, it was hard to listen to all the way through. Some things you should let a man do in peace.
Maybe if he tours with a band this time. Maybe if we get him another songwriting partner, like that New Wave guy in the Cretones who helped Linda Ronstadt. Maybe if he put some big funny glasses on....",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201953.19/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319093341-20190319115341-00546.warc.gz
15,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/2112-deluxe-edition-100561/,"Rush have always been one of rock’s all-time great argument starters. Anywhere North American males gather, it’s possible to ignite a fierce debate just by name-dropping these Canadian prog sages. You can quibble over Geddy Lee’s voice or Alex Lifeson’s guitar chops. You can dissect how drummer-librettist Neil Peart’s philosophy has changed drastically over the years. You can question the way they malign wolves in the “Dionysus: Bringer of Love” section of “Cygnus X-I: Book II” from Hemispheres.
But most of all, you can always start an argument over 2112, the 1976 rock opera that made them stars. Rush made more-popular records, more-succinct records, but 2112 – newly reissued in expanded form – is their most extreme, grandiose and Rush-like record, and thus their greatest – the definitive 20 minutes and 34 seconds of the Rush worldview (plus five extra songs on Side Two, which nobody has ever played twice).
It might have made sense to reissue 2112 a year ago, so everyone could drunkenly download it on New Year’s Eve. But that would have been obvious and predictable, which isn’t Rush’s style. That’s why on their 2012 tour, with their popularity at an all-time peak, they chose to highlight their Eighties synth-pop phase, which Rush fans regard the way Zeppelin fans regard Jimmy Page’s Death Wish II soundtrack. Rush like to keep people mystified.
The deluxe version of 2112 features remastered music (although, philosophically speaking, not mastered at all). It adds three live tracks and a digital comic-book version of the story, which goes like this: In the futuristic society of Megadon, where music is outlawed, a kid finds an old guitar. He figures out how to play it, which makes him a criminal to the evil priests from the Temples of Syrinx. Can his innocent strums revive the ancient spirit of music? Can he escape the tyranny of the elders? Will they let him rock? (Spoiler alert: Noooo!)
Although Peart was still in his long-since-abandoned Ayn Rand phase, 2112 has really nothing to do with the New York speed-freak author. Instead, it has an authentically grubby dork compassion. 2112 doesn’t try to emulate the lame upscale respectability of other rock operas. The abrasively distinctive sonics, from Peart’s busy tempo shifts to Lee’s squawk of doom, keep it from ever fading into the background. Nobody will ever turn it into a Broadway show.
It’s built to be played loud on headphones, late at night, all alone, staring at the wall and wondering when your life is going to stop feeling like imprisonment in the towers of Megadon. What are Rush but a three-headed “It Gets Better” statement for generations of messed-up adolescents, dreaming of a better world but unwilling to give up on this one?
So what will people argue about now that Rush have been voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? Don’t worry – Rush fans can just move on to debating why their heroes are deprived of knighthoods or the Nobel Prize in economics. Rush fans love to argue. And Rush obviously like it that way.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202671.79/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322135230-20190322161230-00207.warc.gz

Four years and 30 million albums sold later, remorse is still her muse. But where 21 was the sound of a woman soldiering through bad romance, 25 finds her queenly and resolute, lamenting the past on songs with titles like ""Water Under the Bridge"" and ""When We Were Young."" Even ""Hello"" is a goodbye. The nostalgic mood is the perfect fit for an artist who reaches back decades for her influences, even as her all-or-nothing urgency feels utterly modern.
Some of pop&apos;s biggest names, from Max Martin to Bruno Mars, join familiar faces like Paul Epworth and Ryan Tedder in 25&apos;s dream team of producers and co-writers. They help create a rich set of songs without getting in the way of the lady in charge. ""River Lea,"" a collaboration with Danger Mouse, is an organ-heavy soul shouter, and ""Water Under the Bridge"" builds to gospel-steeped ecstasy. Adele is more somber on ""Million Years Ago,"" a gorgeous acoustic reverie that suggests Caetano Veloso writing for Dusty Springfield. ""I feel like my life is flashing by,"" she sings, her voice deepening with regret and sounding decades beyond her years.
The music feels more mature, too, on torchy ballads like ""When We Were Young"" and ""Love in the Dark."" The most powerful moment is ""All I Ask,"" a silken tempest co-written with Mars, where Adele addresses a lover on what she knows will be their final night, processing the end of an affair in what feels like slow motion. When she sings, ""Give me a memory I can use,"" it&apos;s like she&apos;s already imagining the heartrending song she&apos;ll craft from the experience. There&apos;s vulnerability in that moment, but there&apos;s also grace and resilience.  
Throughout 25, there&apos;s a deeper sense of artistic command. In a great, intimate bit before the start of ""Send My Love (To Your New Lover),"" she issues orders to the guys in the studio: ""Just the guitar."" The Martin-helmed song that follows – built on a nimble acoustic figure – is a farewell to an ex who couldn&apos;t deal with Adele&apos;s fire, sung with chill composure.
Whether she&apos;s holding notes with the strength of a suspension bridge or enjoying a rare lighthearted ""whoo-hoo!"" on ""Sweetest Devotion,"" her incredible phrasing – the way she can infuse any line with nuance and power – is more proof that she&apos;s among the greatest interpreters of romantic lyrics. ""No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you,"" she sings on the gently lifting ""Remedy."" On 25, no feat of strength comes as a surprise. Let&apos;s just hope the next one is called 28, and not, say, 30.

19,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/4-track-demos-247172/,"The pop Industry loves to simulate authenticity, a trick that, like the manufacturing of fake antiques, puts demands on the consumer. It&apos;s hard to tell an original (Michelle Shocked&apos;s The Texas Campfire Tapes) from a copy (the Cowboy Junkies). So make no mistake: Raw, revelatory and indispensable, 4-Track Demos is no mere PJ Harvey Unplugged. These 14 cuts, recorded by English songwriter Polly Jean Harvey in 1992 on a four-track, reveal an artist in the pure state of creation, fully in her element, on her own.
The tracks were demos for Rid of Me, the album the trio PJ Harvey released last spring. Eight songs made it to that disc; five others have never been released before; one, ""Reeling,"" appears in a full-band version on the single for ""50 Ft. Queenie."" Harvey, so the story goes, wanted to release the demos along with the finished album, as she did in limited editions of the band&apos;s debut, Dry. Economics made a double release unfeasible. As it is, the depth, range and conceptual completeness of Demos make you wonder why Harvey bothered with such conventions as a band and a producer at all.
Undoubtedly, Harvey has wondered the same thing hence the release of Demos and her announcement of an indeterminate band structure after the departure of drummer Rob Ellis. The demos prove how much of the band&apos;s sound Harvey had been responsible for. Her guitar and vocal rhythms on these tapes, which are spare in production but dense in ideas, are so rich and forceful that bass and drums are scarcely missed. This isn&apos;t so much a dis of Ellis and bassist Steve Vaughan, who are able musicians, as an affirmation of Harvey&apos;s self-sufficiency.
Demos, however, does make Rid of Me producer Steve Albini look like an unimaginative dullard. All the arrangements for the tracks on Rid of Me are fully in place on Demos, as are the best production ideas some of which Albini didn&apos;t even use. Everybody already knows that Albini buried Harvey&apos;s superb singing, but the demos reveal that the king of noise didn&apos;t even capture the expressive range of her guitar playing.
Demos&apos; extra tracks raise questions about why Rid of Me bothered with such filler as ""Highway 61 Revisited"" and two versions of ""Man-Size."" ""Reeling"" is one of Harvey&apos;s catchiest rockers, a tune whose shameless aspirations ""I want to bathe in milk/Eat grapes/Robert De Niro/Sit on my face"" will surely go down in history. Harvey&apos;s acid defense of female sexuality in ""Easy"" dramatizes why women have embraced her. And her use of blues on ""Goodnight,"" a distorted dream about a house in the country, as well as Spanish guitars, violins and elements of folk and opera elsewhere on Demos, shows that this postpunk Joni Mitchell has visions of a world larger than the alternative nation.
The fantasies in ""Reeling"" and ""Goodnight"" confirm desire and disappointment as Harvey&apos;s main themes.

24,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/808s-heartbreak-255317/,"Kanye West announced long ago that mere hip-hop superstardom was not enough for him — he wanted to be ""the number one artist in the world."" So it&apos;s no surprise that his untrammeled egotism has led him well beyond the usual limits of his genre. With Kanye largely abandoning rapping in favor of digitally altered crooning, his fourth album represents a cultural high-water mark for Auto-Tune, that now ubiquitous pitch-correction technology. But Auto-Tune isn&apos;t totally to blame for 808s & Heartbreak. A bold, fascinating, foolhardy, occasionally unlistenable Kanye West record was inevitable, with or without the cyborg-soul software.
So blame it on the heartbreak. The record arrives in the wake of a year in which Kanye lost his mother and split with his fiancée, designer Alexis Phifer. But aside from one bleak song written for his mom (""Coldest Winter""), 808s & Heartbreak is a breakup album — it&apos;s Kanye&apos;s would-be Here, My Dear or Blood on the Tracks, a mournful song-suite that swings violently between self-pity and self-loathing. ""The coldest story ever told/Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul . . . How could you be so heartless?"" he sings in ""Heartless."" Kanye has often chosen introspection and self-exposure to the usual gangsta posturing. But here, the drear never lifts, and he never stops wallowing.
Thankfully, there are those 808s. Kanye constructed the songs using a classic Roland TR-808 drum machine, and the results are a pleasant shock: stark, spacey tracks, which owe far more to Eighties electro and synth pop than anything on hip-hop radio. In ""Street Lights,"" a haze of distortion floats above tolling keyboard chords and a hammering beat. The hit ""Love Lockdown"" is powered by thundering tribal drums and vocals that slide from digitized trills into strangled squeals.
Kanye can&apos;t really sing in the classic sense, but he&apos;s not trying to. T-Pain taught the world that Auto-Tune doesn&apos;t just sharpen flat notes: It&apos;s a painterly device for enhancing vocal expressiveness, and upping the pathos. In ""Bad News,"" Kanye&apos;s digitized vocals are the sound of a man so stupefied by grief, he&apos;s become less than human.
Like many sad sacks, Kanye likes the sound of his own whimper, and mistakes sentiments such as ""I could never seem to find what real love was about"" for profundities. Many of his best songs have focused on his ambivalence about materialism, but on 808s & Heartbreak, the theme has hardened into schtick. ""My friend showed me pictures of his kids/And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs."" The low point is the freestyle ""Pinocchio Story,"" recorded live in Singapore, which finds Kanye bellowing, ""There is no Gucci I could buy . . . there is no Louis Vuitton I could put on . . . to get my heart out of this hell.""
Of course, Kanye has always been emo. But in his most touching songs — ""Through the Wire,"" ""Family Business,"" ""Hey Mama"" — he tucked his confessions in between boasts and jokes. Kanye the Songbird has forgotten the lesson that Kanye the Rapper taught his listeners: Heartbreak is not incompatible with wit, or with sharply drawn details, or with a buoyant beat. This noble failure of an album might easily have been a noble success if he had tweaked the Fun-o-Meter just a bit. A slight pitch correction could have done the trick.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203865.15/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325092147-20190325114147-00549.warc.gz

When David Lee Roth and Van Halen went down their own separate mean streets in the Eighties, who paid the price? We did. Van Halen fans everywhere have suffered through the years, waiting for this reunion. We don&apos;t need it to be Fair Warning or Van Halen II. We don&apos;t even need it to be Diver Down. We just deserve a break.
Well, as the man used to say: one break, coming up. Van Halen&apos;s ""heard you missed us, we&apos;re back"" album is not only the most long-awaited reunion joint in the history of reunion joints, it is – against all reasonable expectations – a real Van Halen album. It&apos;s sonically closer to 1984 than to 5150, but it&apos;s closer to 1980&apos;s Women and Children First than to either – no synth glop, no ballads. Eddie always liked to compare the band&apos;s sound to ""Godzilla waking up,"" but this is the real deal. And the old lizard sounds hungry to chomp some power lines.
A Different Kind of Truth is the first Van Halen album since the Nineties dregs of Balance and Van Halen III, which were just humiliating Styx rips. But Eddie has rediscovered his guitar and unplugged the synths, as if Roth&apos;s presence reminded Eddie who his band is named after. Since there&apos;s never been a single Van Halen fan in history who secretly wished Eddie would put down the guitar and play more keyboards, this is a coup. Especially because Eddie&apos;s solos have the fluency of his early Eighties playing – just listen to him stretch out on ""Big River"" and ""Blood and Fire.""
If the songs are based on 1970s demos, that was a wise move, because wherever these 13 tunes came from, there isn&apos;t a single Waldo on the bus. The tempos are atomic-punk fast, letting Alex Van Halen rock out on the drums for the first time since his flaming-gong days. Original bassist Michael Anthony is missed for his bottom end, and even more for his kicked-in-the-nads harmonies. But Wolfgang Van Halen, Eddie&apos;s son, acquits himself superbly – he definitely doesn&apos;t flunk if anyone asks, ""Have you seen Junior&apos;s grades?""
As for Diamond Dave, the gods only made one of him, because they couldn&apos;t take the competition. Now this is a rock star, except no other rock star would try to get away with this many cornball one-liners (""It&apos;s looking like the city towed my other apartment!""). He&apos;s lost a high note or two, but the ""stone-cold sister soccer moms"" he pursues in ""Honeybabysweetiedoll"" probably like him better this way.
Toward the end, Roth reaches down between his legs, eases the seat back and shifts into ""Stay Frosty."" It&apos;s not just the show-stopper – it&apos;s a four-minute anthology of everything that rules about Van Halen. It begins as an acoustic country-blues goof, then switches into metal bombast, as Eddie&apos;s fingers and Roth&apos;s lips take turns showing off. ""Stay Frosty"" ends with the trick Van Halen did better than any band ever: the crashing power-chord-and-drumroll finale, which goes on for 30 insane seconds. It&apos;s ridiculous. It&apos;s obnoxious. It&apos;s awesome. This moment alone sums up why the album needed to happen. We&apos;ve earned it. And so have they.

31,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/a-letter-home-100850/,"Earlier this year, Neil Young unveiled Pono, a super-high-def audio service meant to deliver us from the sonic crimes of the earbud era.

32,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/a-live-one-205743/,"A brief history of noodling: Back in the days when jazz was pop music and swing bands roamed the earth, it was common for horn players to ""noodle"" around the melodies of popular favorites. Benny Goodman was an expert noodler. So was Louis Armstrong.
Then in the 1940s came be-bop, a music that demanded more technique. Veteran noodlers were ridiculed as moldy figs. It&apos;s been up and down ever since: Cool jazzers didn&apos;t noodle, but Dave Brubeck did; Miles Davis never noodled, but many who followed in his footsteps did. Jazz fusion was the big Ramen noodle, a yammering, highly technical cacophony of questionable nutritional value.
These days, noodling is the province of spring-water hippies. Improbably enough, it also has become big business. While the music world spent the past few years obsessing over grunge, a grass-roots, militia-movement-style takeover of the amphitheaters of America progressed virtually unnoticed. The bands responsible — staffed mostly by wonky, bearded, computer-literate, sensitive guys — are everywhere, with operations that stretch to every corner of the Internet. You know the list: Blues Traveler, Spin Doctors, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Dave Matthews Band, God Street Wine, Rusted Root.
Then there are Phish, the slipperiest of the lot, a Vermont group prone to outbursts of barbershop-quartet harmony, vacuum-cleaner solos and neoclassical gibberish. While most noodle rock ambles in circles, Phish lead listeners on a conceptual journey. Phish cater to those unmoved by grungy angst and bored by arena-rock regimentation. Phish are probably the most self-indulgent act ever to sell out New York&apos;s Madison Square Garden.
Phish are also getting the last laugh. A Live One, Phish&apos;s twin-disc live offering, turns out to be the definitive statement of the jam-band aesthetic, a noodler manifesto.
Regardless of your noodle tolerance, A Live One contains everything you need to know about Phish and just about everything that&apos;s worth knowing about the genre. The album&apos;s 12 selections are precision minded and crisply executed, notable for their elaborate tension-building schemes and chamber-group division of labor, in which the roles of soloist and accompanist are fluid. And at the very moment Phish seem poised for a commercial breakthrough, A Live One glories in avowedly noncommercial, determinedly adolescent music distinguished by outbreaks of fey vocal nonsense, contrived dissonance and lyrics like ""Control for smilers can&apos;t be bought/The solar garlic starts to rot.""
The mistake, of course, is to look to Phish for deep meaning or any meaning at all. The band, led by guitarist Trey Anastasio, doesn&apos;t really write songs; it creates platforms for noodling and then dutifully supplies clean, precise improvisations that are often compared to Sun Ra but have much more in common with Pat Metheny or (yikes) Al Di Meola. Until the solos start, Phish are mostly nonsense; their compositions wade through vaguely funky vamps, fishing for the next profound idea. They&apos;re like Zappa, except without Zappa&apos;s determination to destroy conventional notions of guitar heroics.
Instead, Anastasio prefers to gnaw at the edges of convention, twisting familiar bits of blues and rock guitar into a palatable post-fusion mélange in which melodic continuity is only one consideration. He&apos;s not a groundbreaking soloist or a technical wizard, but he does have a good grasp of idioms and styles and knows how to milk a note or phrase for maximum dramatic impact. His instrumental voice is the glue that holds together otherwise disjointed moments like the gospel-shout chorus on ""Chalkdust Torture,"" the vaguely gritty middle section of ""Gumbo"" and the jumpy stop-and-start grooves of the live staple ""Harry Hood.""
Even at their most excessive, Phish pull off conceptual leaps that elude their jamming brethren. The music, both in concert and on the carefully recorded A Live One, revolves around changes in texture and color rarely found in arena-level rock. Things evolve right before your ears: A knotty little phrase blossoms into a sunny reggae lilt, the tiniest noodle becomes a major theme. The soloists may not be Coltrane, but they&apos;re better than credible. Anastasio improvises with a dexterity and authority long missing from the brute-force hammering that dominates alternative rock. And while selections like the 30-minute ""Tweezer"" feel like novelties aimed at too-stoned-to-care concertgoers, a case can be made that these songs are the ideal soundtrack for the alienation, information overload and various other crises that plague this modern world. Yeah, the solar garlic is rotting — there&apos;s nothing we can do. Might as well noodle on.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202299.16/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320044358-20190320070358-00189.warc.gz
33,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/a-m-187587/,"Gram Parsons had a vision back in the &apos;60s. With his International Submarine Band, Flying Burrito Brothers and later as a solo artist, he blazed the trail for pot-smokin&apos;, free-thinkin&apos; rock & roll boys (and girls) to play real-deal C&W. More than 20 years after Parsons&apos; death, Wilco are following that dream.
Wilco were spawned by Uncle Tupelo of Belleville, Ill., who, over the course of four albums, added country twang to their wash of guitar noise. As the tempos slowed, the frictions in the band apparently increased, and the combo, led by Belleville hometown boys Jeff Tweedy and Jay Farrar, broke up. The only good thing about this is that each songwriter has gone his separate way to spread the gospel. First out of the gate is Tweedy&apos;s Wilco, who have made one hell of a country-guts debut, A.M.
Tweedy enlisted other Tupeloes: bassist John Stirratt and drummer Ken Coomer, as well as multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston. For A.M., Wilco were joined by fellow Midwestern guitar slinger Brian Henneman (from the raucous Bottle Rockets of Festus, Mo.) and Texas pedal steel maestro Lloyd Maines. The band&apos;s back-porch groove is the perfect underpinning for Tweedy&apos;s laconic baritone; he leaves wide-open spaces with his laid-back phrasing and the plain-spoken poetry of his lyrics. Maines&apos; lovesick pedal steel and Johnston&apos;s nimble offerings on mandolin, banjo, dobro and fiddle add plaintiveness, while Henneman&apos;s Neil Young-inspired guitar antics provide muscle.
Just as classic country tells of lovin&apos;, cheatin&apos; and drinkin&apos; — real life in everyday language — so does Tweedy&apos;s small-town worldview have an Everyman honesty. There hasn&apos;t been a more real breakup song than ""Box Full of Letters,"" and ""Passenger Side"" describes another kind of loss — that of a DWI license suspension. Tweedy and crew have also absorbed riffs from their forefathers, and they spit them back: a touch of ""Honky Tonk Women"" here (""Casino Queen""), a dash of Tomight&apos;s the Night there. Present throughout, of course, are Parsons and his heroes George Jones and Merle Haggard.
Wilco&apos;s no-frills recipe for heartfelt C&W rock is most satisfying, just as Tweedy spells it out in ""Blue Eyed Soul"": ""Can you keep it simple/Can you let the snare crack/Can you let it move without holding back."" Wilco have done that and more.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202572.7/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321213516-20190321235516-00326.warc.gz

The seduction isn&apos;t in these words, of course, but in Stewart&apos;s utter exultation as he delineates every romantic&apos;s dilemma. Still, there&apos;s no logical or technical argument to substantiate my passion or justify my faith. I only know that this music makes me feel larger, fuller, more alive. And if that isn&apos;t what it is for, it&apos;s not for anything.
But this album&apos;s best song, ""Tonight&apos;s the Night,"" is defensible both logically and technically. One of many tributes to Sam Cooke, Stewart&apos;s soul music inspiration, it is also his closest approximation of that sound. The strings, for once, are perfect — only Cooke or Stewart could swing through such syrup with so little effort and so much power. The guitar figure has the kind of pop elegance that characterized Abbey Road; the drumming is as confident as the singing.
This classic soul structure is used, with as much canniness as Stewart has ever displayed, for a lyric unique in all his writing. ""Tonight&apos;s the Night"" is a blissful love song, capturing the feeling of the beginning of a relationship with the grace Stewart has more commonly applied to love&apos;s end. Here are those perfect moments in the beginning when everything is possible:
Don&apos;t say a word, my virgin childJust let your inhibitions run wildThe secret is about to unfoldUpstairs before the night&apos;s too old
Such pleasures never last long — if ""Tonight&apos;s the Night"" is about the first few weeks of sexual passion, the rest of the album is about the rest of a lifetime. But the promise of ""Tonight&apos;s the Night,"" its tenderness, gives greater resonance than ever before to the catastrophes which inevitably follow Stewart.
Cat Stevens&apos;s ""The First Cut Is the Deepest"" does the job, marred only by an utterly banal guitar solo. But no one can handle feckless love better than Stewart. He treats it as it is, with more complicated emotions than simple self-pity, though with a full measure of that, and blame is spread evenly or not at all. ""Fool for You"" is cut from the mold that gave us ""Maggie May"" and ""You Wear It Well,"" but neither the music nor the situation has worn out. In his heart, Rod Stewart, like Smokey Robinson, remains the young innocent, tender to the soul, naive to the end. Even when bitter, he&apos;s gentle: ""I&apos;m gonna leave my records and a forwarding address/Ain&apos;t you glad, honey, that I&apos;m offa your chest."" No matter how ugly the end, as he leaves he really believes what he whispers: ""Guess I&apos;ll always love ya, all my life.""
The hilarious but more than half-serious ""The Balltrap"" reminds us how gruesome the conclusion of a great love affair can be. But even nightly jilted, Stewart refuses to give up without a fight. ""The Balltrap"" is a fine slice of Faces-level rock & roll, driven by Fats Domino piano, wacky horns, a turbulent slide guitar. It is also the album&apos;s only original rocker. This hurts the album&apos;s ""fast side"" and, beyond that, the division into rock and romance suggests that Stewart&apos;s not quite dispersed his old group&apos;s ghost. The quality of the nonoriginal rock is another problem — here&apos;s where my personal attraction to his music creates confusion. I like the idea of doing ""Pretty Flamingo"" as a mock tango, but no one else I know does. And I prefer Ron Wood&apos;s version of ""Big Bayou"" but like ""The Wild Side of Life"" better than Hank Thompson&apos;s country classic original. ""Trade Winds,"" the ballad that closes the fast side, is more banal than incongruous. Maybe he&apos;d better get a new band quick ... or devote himself entirely to slow and mid-tempo songs.
The final song on the ""slow side"" is proof enough that he can work that form as well as anyone who&apos;s ever sung or written rock & roll music. ""The Killing of Georgie, Part I & II"" is among the best songs Stewart has ever written and absolutely the bravest. Here is the pink-suited, rooster-coifed rock dilettante laying it on the line for friendship, not even love. Here is one of rock&apos;s leading androgynes writing a breathtakingly tender song about the murder of a gay pal without flinching. I have left it for last not only because it is Stewart&apos;s breakthrough as a composer but because I am more than a bit in awe of it.
The music alone would make ""Georgie"" a major achievement. The double-time, chantlike vocal is reminiscent of Bob Dylan&apos;s recent approach, but with all the melodiousness Dylan discards. Its female doo-wop chorus, accelerated like Lou Reed&apos;s ""Walk on the Wild Side,"" is supported by a delicate web of guitar, organ and string figures that is totally Stewart&apos;s own.
What counts more is the matter-of-fact concern he brings to the story. The best rock songs are moving ever closer to good prose fiction — for proof, a listen to Born to Run, the best parts of Desire or ""Memory Motel"" will suffice  —  and ""Georgie"" too is written completely within this style, at least before its watershed coda. As in Springsteen&apos;s ""Back-streets,"" Dylan&apos;s ""Mozambique"" and Neil Young&apos;s much different ""Tonight&apos;s the Night,"" what&apos;s at stake is loyalty, friendship — the ethical motifs of the western movie. When Georgie dies, Stewart remains cool, but there&apos;s an ache in his voice and a shadow in his words that tell you this tale is breaking his heart:
Out of a darkened side street cameA New Jersey gang with just one aimTo roll some innocent passerby ...Another kid, a switchblade knife,He did not intend to take his lifeHe just pushed his luck a little too far that nightThe sight of blood dispersed the gang,A crowd gathered, the police cameAn ambulance screamed to a halt at 53rd and 3rdDoo doo doo Doo doo doo Doo doo doo
The jolly chorus is awful, as though the Stones had decided to do ""Heartbreaker"" as a novelty number about the pleasures of mugging. That&apos;s how Stewart tries to leave us, the classic rock & roll dilettante quoting a piece of Georgie&apos;s street philosophy about nothing mattering but the moment. But the final line betrays his real grief: Georgie was a friend of mine.
This is Stewart&apos;s real strength: a working-class eloquence, a belief in the simplest truths that won&apos;t let him get caught up in the canonization of mere punks and gangsters. That simple sentence is just the thing that makes him great, redeems his failures and gives all who listen something for which there is no substitute.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202199.51/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320024206-20190320050206-00389.warc.gz
35,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/a-period-of-transition-203652/,"It&apos;s been a long haul for both the Band and Van Morrison; they have made their livings as rock & rollers for close to 20 years now. To judge solely by their new albums (Morrison&apos;s is his first release since 1974) time is catching up with them, though whether they will again outdistance it remains an open question. Morrison made better music in &apos;64 and &apos;65 with Them, the first (and last?) great Irish rock & roll band; as the Hawks, the Band made better music in &apos;63, covering Bobby Bland and Muddy Waters tunes at the tail end of a Ronnie Hawkins session. Not that rock & roll has ever had anything to do with ""progress.""
There is a lot of neo-R&B huffing and puffing on A Period of Transition (from what to what?), but Morrison&apos;s performances rarely find a focus, almost never hit a groove. The grand gestures of Morrison&apos;s style at its most rhetorical (""We are Them, take it or leave it,"" he snarled during his 1964 sessions) fade in the air. The emotion that would justify those gestures, that would put a little terror into borrowed lines like ""From a whisper to a scream,"" is just out of reach: Transition is ""Jackie Wilson Said"" without the bite.
The key to the album&apos;s sluggishness is the dullness of the horn charts. Van is the most inventive and lyrical arranger of horns rock & roll has known since the heyday of Stax-Volt, but ""Flamingos Fly"" is the only tune to which the horns add anything but sound; there, they add wit and a sense of fun. This is ""Jackie Wilson Said"" and something more; the album&apos;s finest number by a long distance. The groove is irresistible, and it capsizes the rest of the album.
Van Morrison once sang ""Listen to the Lion"" and made you feel as if you&apos;d been cornered by one; he will do it again, but he doesn&apos;t do it on Transition. This is by no means a bad album, but it lives up to its title all too well.
""I&apos;m not really here, I just stick around for my friends,"" Captain Beefheart used to say, and that sums up what I hear on Islands — which is not nothing. To be sure, there&apos;s not a grand gesture on it. I can&apos;t imagine this album meaning anything to someone who does not feel that his or her successes and failures are somehow reflected in the Band&apos;s. If one does feel that, Islands is anything but hollow — it may sound like an unassuming last word, if hardly a last stand.
Since the members of the Band have not moved to Hawaii, it&apos;s the album&apos;s title, and the specter of the Band&apos;s recent farewell concert, that implies that last word. Rick Danko and Levon Helm have signed solo recording contracts, and Helm is already working with Dr. John and Paul Butterfield; the thinness of the material on Islands suggests they may be keeping their best songs for their own albums, and the inclusion of a couple of oldies doesn&apos;t make up the difference. ""Ain&apos;t That a Lotta Love,"" a barband staple that a couple of years ago on a San Francisco stage Levon, Garth Hudson, Danko, Neil Young, Tim Drummond and Ben Keith stomped out as if they meant to stop the sun in its tracks, is on Islands the stiffest excuse for R&B I ever want to hear; too many of Robbie Robertson&apos;s tunes offer cracker-barrel banalities without the music that could redeem them — or disguise them. ""You don&apos;t know what you want &apos;til you find out what you need"" might be true and it might not be, but the point is it isn&apos;t interesting.
Save for a couple of Richard Manuel&apos;s vocals, I was ready to give up on this record. Then I began to hear it on the radio, and it sounded fresh. Now, while the first side of the LP passes pleasantly and tiresomely enough, side two seems like real people talking: that last word. ""Islands,"" the title instrumental, is slight and pretty — it disarms one&apos;s desire for grand gestures, and it sets a tone. The tone is one of moderation; that is almost what the best songs here are about, in their music, in the feeling they get across. Manuel&apos;s version of ""Georgia on My Mind"" recalls the heart he put into ""Whispering Pines,"" almost eight years ago. ""Knockin&apos; Lost John,"" a fine, unprofound ditty about the Great Depression of the Thirties, simply speaks to the present, and again, Manuel, without ever reaching for a note, gives the piece its authenticity; his voice carries the authority of an old man who can put up with anything but who&apos;d just as soon not. ""I went through it once,"" he seems to be saying. ""I&apos;m damned if I&apos;ll go through it again.""
And then there is ""Livin&apos; in a Dream,"" which closes out the set: a rewrite of ""Row Row Row Your Boat."" Well, it is the best song on Islands — a perfect cut. I hear it as a leave-taking, but then I have finales on my mind. The beat could not be less hurried, nor could the lines Levon sings, nor the way he sings them:
I&apos;m gonna buy buy buy you A sheepskin coat I&apos;m gonna string red rubies round your throat Gently down the stream I will row your boat &apos;Cause you know we&apos;re only livin&apos; in a dream.
There&apos;s no languor in the song, only pleasure; there are no promises that can&apos;t be kept, and the promises Levon makes seem to have been kept when the tune ends. That spirit doesn&apos;t sell records, but it may keep them in mind, when the time is right.
Still, in rock & roll a little modesty goes a long way. These are not the worst albums Van Morrison and the Band have made, but except for Morrison&apos;s ""Flamingos Fly"" and the Band&apos;s ""Livin&apos; in a Dream"" they make the best almost inexplicable. One cannot think of the power of ""Chest Fever"" and easily understand the triviality of ""Ain&apos;t That a Lotta Love""; one can&apos;t quite pin down the fatal difference between the urgency of ""St. Dominic&apos;s Preview"" or ""You Don&apos;t Pull No Punches but You Don&apos;t Push the River"" and the unconvincing strain of most of Transition. What you do, if you are committed to these artists, is wait.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201521.60/warc/CC-MAIN-20190318172016-20190318194016-00024.warc.gz
36,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/a-quick-one-happy-jack-205771/,"The Who weren&apos;t always a nostalgia act or merely makers of pleasant Broadway fodder. Their tough, early tracks are a key punk resource, so it hardly matters that they were forever doomed to third place behind the Beatles and the Stones in the British-pop sweepstakes. At best, the Who&apos;s raw power and intelligence offered essential messages to any era.
Latecomers to the &apos;60s British Invasion, the Who were mod sympathizers stealing Kinks riffs and American-pop formulas before they found their own mix of brute force and melody. Each player was essential: guitarist and songwriter Pete Townshend with his windmill riffing and knack for shaping his increasingly complex song narratives into blissful pop; Roger Daltrey and his thundering vocals; Keith Moon with his frenetic drum attack; and master bassman John Entwistle, steadfastly holding it all together. How fast those memories fade after this last decade of endless farewell tours and beer endorsements.
Just in time to rescue a worthy reputation come these newly expanded, remastered and remixed versions of the Who&apos;s transitional albums, A Quick One, The Who Sell Out and Live at Leeds. Each has been digitally cleaned up, with several previously unreleased tracks added to the original albums (look for a rave-up of TV&apos;s Batman theme on A Quick One). Gone are the old ""crackling noises"" disclaimed on the original copies of Leeds. Other Who milestones (Quadrophenia, Who Are You, etc.) are due from MCA in the coming months, but these three are the important documents. They chart the Who&apos;s growth from a charming singles act into a quartet of innovators.
There is a rare genuineness to the upbeat pop of 1966&apos;s A Quick One (originally titled Happy Jack for its United States release when the British title was deemed too suggestive for American kids). Silly aural experiments like Moon&apos;s self-explanatory ""Cobwebs and Strange"" often dissolve into a shapeless mess but remain wonderful relics of an adventurous era. And balancing every misfire is an absolutely perfect, poignant pop tune like Townshend&apos;s ""So Sad About Us."" Things were already changing by the time The Who Sell Out was released a year later. And not simply because this was the Who&apos;s first full concept album but because it re-created the feel of a U.K. radio station, complete with joke commercials. More important is the sound, with the band finally capturing a full, wizened tone that&apos;s distinctly its own. Songs like ""I Can See for Miles"" are played out on a massive scale, with Daltrey&apos;s ever-broadening range at center stage.
By the time the Who arrived for their concert at Leeds University, on Feb. 14, 1970, they had evolved into a fiery, complex unit. Ambitious? The band&apos;s most recent project was the rock opera Tommy. At Leeds, the Who&apos;s response to heightened expectations was an epic performance tossed off almost casually. The new Live at Leeds LP captures most of that concert and at nearly twice the length of the original release. ""My Generation"" is extended into a nearly 15-minute heavy blues jam with Tommy bits weaved in.
Depressingly, by the Who&apos;s 25th anniversary tour, flat journeyman arena rock had replaced the passion. In 1989, the Who expressed less with 12 players than they had in Leeds with four.

37,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/a-saucerful-of-secrets-184964/,"The Pink Floyd were in the forefront of the self-consiously psychedelic rock movement in Britain as it developed over a year ago; they had to their credit a couple of promising singles (""Arnold Layne"" and ""See Emily Play"") and a fairly impressive first album. The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Syd Barrett (vocals and lead guitar) displayed a minor talent for writing as well as a not insubstantial ability to prepare special effects and production work. If much the Floyd did was based on gimmicks, Barrett at least had a keen ear that rather successfully structured gimmicks into a sort of pleasant ""psychedelic chamber music.""
Unfortunately the Pink Floyd&apos;s second album, A Saucerful of Secrets, is not as interesting as their first, as a matter of fact, it is rather mediocre. For one thing Barrett seems either to have left the group or to have given up actively participating in it: only one Barrett composition is on the new album (""Jugband Blues""), and it hardly does credit to Barrett&apos;s credentials as a composer.
With Barrett gone we are left with the work of bassist Roger Waters and organist Rick Wright. Waters (who wrote a couple of dull tracks on the first album) is an uninteresting writer, vocalist, and bass player. ""Let There Be More Light"" and ""Set the Controls for the Heart of The Sun"" are boring melodically, harmonically, and lyrically. The production work is not as glittery as the first album&apos;s, and the instrumental work is shoddy and routine; yet both tracks run some five minutes, two examples of unnecessary length in rock.
Waters&apos; ""Corporal Clegg"" at least has the virtue of brevity, as well as not sounding like it was written in a drugged stupor, but its unoriginal melody is much too Beatley for these post Sgt. Pepper days.
Rick Wright, whose organ playing is generally capable if not inventive, has also contributed a couple of songs to Saucerful. ""Remember a Day"" itself is inoffensive, but features some rather miserable bottleneck guitar, second rate piano, and empty-sounding acoustic guitar work. Here, as throughout, Nickie Mason&apos;s drumming is busy and ineffective. Wright&apos;s ""See-Saw"" is a ballad scored vocally in a style incongruously reminiscent of Ronnie and The Daytonas.
The album&apos;s title track is eleven minutes of psychedelic muzak, hardly electronic music, but hardly creative rock either. There&apos;s a lot of interesting noise, and at times one almost is tempted to take the whole conglomeration as a significant experimental probe.
But as the chaos settles reassuringly into a banal organ-cum-religious chorus final, one realizes that the Pink Floyd are firmly anchored in the diatonic world with any deviations from that norm a matter of effect rather than musical conviction. Unfortunately a music of effects is a weak base for a rock group to rest its reputation on — but this is what the Pink Floyd have done.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205534.99/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326135436-20190326161436-00403.warc.gz
38,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/a-sense-of-wonder-93506/,"A Sense Of Wonder is a plateau for Van Morrison: his first record for his new label, it draws upon and summarizes the last four albums he made for Warner Bros., which documented a period of spiritual awakening. Each of those records focused upon a different aspect of Morrison&apos;s religiosity — rebirth (Into the Music); deep contemplation and meditation (Common One); ecstasy and humility (Beautiful Vision); and blissful, mantralike languor (Inarticulate Speech of the Heart). A Sense of Wonder is a grand act of synthesis and overview, affirming the artist&apos;s sense of place and self in terms of his Celtic roots.
Over the years, Morrison has gathered around him a band that plays, like the best jazz ensembles, with effortless empathy. The group follows him through all his moods and meanderings, from the lilting cadences of ""Tore Down à la Rimbaud"" and ""Ancient of Days"" to the stately auguring of ""Let the Slave"" (set to a text by William Blake) and the airy, triumphal shimmer of ""A New Kind of Man."" On two other songs, Morrison is accompanied by an ensemble called Moving Hearts, which plays in a more traditional Irish vein. In ""A Sense of Wonder"" Morrison calls out a jumble of street names, colors, characters and raw, unintellectualized feelings in the free-associative style of James Joyce and Morrison&apos;s own Astral Weeks.
As usual, Morrison offers praise to his literary idols, invoking Arthur Rimbaud and William Blake, and honors his jazz-soul mentors as well, covering both Ray Charles&apos; ""What Would I Do without You"" and Mose Allison&apos;s ""If You Only Knew."" In Morrison&apos;s hands, the former composition becomes a hymn of gratitude and confession. ""If You Only Knew,"" unfortunately, is a petulant complaint sung in a manner too derivative of Allison&apos;s bohemian-jazzbo style; it sours, for a moment, the exquisite grace of the record. As it happens, the song was a last-minute replacement for ""Crazy Jane on God"" (based on the poem by William Butler Yeats), which was dropped when Yeats&apos; estate denied Morrison permission to use the text (the estate gives permission only to classical musicians). It&apos;s a shame, since the deleted song&apos;s refrain — ""All things remain in God"" — and Morrison&apos;s extraordinary musical setting evoked the revelatory wonder and mystery at the heart of the LP. But ""The Master&apos;s Eyes,"" which counterpoints a beatific affirmation of belief (""How the light shone from the master&apos;s eyes"") with a sepulchral brooding (""Why didn&apos;t they leave us to wander through buttercup summers?""), is ample compensation. Overall, A Sense of Wonder is serenely uplifting.

Hoping to make her into the pop star that various tiny labels and a bizarre stretch on RCA could not, Elektra debuts Simone in a harmless cabaret mood. With his flair for the obvious, producer Andre Fischer (the craftsman of Natalie Cole&apos;s yuppie classic, Unforgettable) keeps the arrangements muted and swingy against the simplistic tunes (no fewer than three Rod McKuen compositions pack this record). Simone&apos;s grainy, dark and highly self-conscious voice has absolutely nowhere to go.
Not for lack of trying, of course. The range of Simone&apos;s vocal expression always outreaches the material&apos;s intention; that&apos;s her scary charm. But Fischer&apos;s work implies that he didn&apos;t get out of his armchair once. He&apos;s damagingly respectful, denying the possibilities of danger, misery or, God forbid, humor in this menu of jazz-soul nightclub moments.

Nor on the other hand will I succumb to the enormous temptation to sniff, ""On Soap Opera the Kinks sound pretty well washed up.""
What I will tell you is that, compared to such earlier splendors of their creation as the utterly marvelous Arthur — of which Soap is in many ways a lame and tepid rehash — this album sounds like the work of a group that&apos;s attempting to conceal the evaporation of its genius by inserting spoken dialogue between tracks so they can ask you to believe they&apos;re pioneering the concept of the rock-album-as-theater.
Musically, there isn&apos;t one really striking melody on the album, although there are plenty of tedious, hackneyed, ready-made ones: It may be that I didn&apos;t retain sufficiently close rein on my attention, but I still can&apos;t recall hearing even one remotely arresting melodic phrase throughout the album. As for the words, we&apos;re one to ignore the laxly adhered to, skeletally developed and none-too-innovative plot (a big shot investigates an alternative, less glamorous life-style and discovers too late that he can&apos;t return to his own).

Neil Young changed guises at a furious pace in the early Eighties. In 1982, he was making vocoder-slathered New Wave; the following year, he staged a rockabilly revival. Then, in 1984, Young shifted gears toward classic country. Touring with the International Harvesters, an eight-piece group of Nashville pros, Young performed both countryfied versions of his classics and cuts from his 1985 album Old Ways. He also debuted five brand-new tracks that had been shelved until this live album, which cherry-picks from the Harvesters&apos; gigs.

What Bob Wills did back there before the war was to take his Texas-bred taste in music and graft it with a jazz (swing, if you will) feel; sort of white country blues with a syncopated beat. It was dance music, for that was most of their gigs, traveling by their own bus to make that next dance hall. But Bob Wills made that hillbilly stuff swing!
Mr. Haggard&apos;s good-sounding record doesn&apos;t bother with Mr. Wills&apos; big band period. It concentrates (with help of some of the original Texas Playboys) on some of the not-much-smaller combo&apos;s best tunes. As a re-creation of a band gone-by, it makes it. Not as good as the original 78s, mind you, but that wasn&apos;t the idea. Kind of sounds like everything was rechanneled for stereo (if you&apos;ve heard the originals, that is). Slicker, more polished. Fender instead of a regular string bass. All the notes are right. The Playboys of the Thirties and Forties left in the not-so-perfect choruses, did weird turn-around time changes, and sounded like they generally really fucking enjoyed themselves. Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys was just that. These guys were fonkey in their music and their scenes, it seems. The lyric content of their material lets you in on what they did on the side. Cocaine and groupies ain&apos;t all that new.
Tommy Duncan was the Playboy&apos;s lead singer so I guess that means Merle Haggard is supposed to be him on this recording. But Merle&apos;s also supposed to be Wills himself. The latter did play some violin, but wasn&apos;t the lead fiddler (twin violins, get it?). No, no — Bob Wills&apos; charm on those old records was his constant sparse rap through most every side. He&apos;d give everybody in the band a bad time. Taunt, jive, jibe and joke. Sounded sort of like a white nigger running off at the mouth. Merle does a bit of this talking, but Wills was the master. ""Women and children cryin&apos; Willie, Willie!""

43,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/abbey-road-181270/,"Simply, side two does more for me than the whole of Sgt. Pepper, and I&apos;ll trade you The Beatles and Magical Mystery Tour and a Keith Moon drumstick for side one.
So much for the prelims. ""Come Together"" is John Lennon very nearly at the peak of his form; twisted, freely-associative, punful lyrically, pinched and somehow a little smug vocally. Breathtakingly recorded (as is the whole album), with a perfect little high-hat-tom-tom run by Ringo providing a clever semi-colon to those eerie shooo-ta&apos;s, Timothy Leary&apos;s campaign song opens up things in grand fashion indeed.
George&apos;s vocal, containing less adenoids and more grainy Paul tunefulness than ever before, is one of many highlights on his ""Something,"" some of the others being more excellent drum work, a dead catchy guitar line, perfectly subdued strings, and an unusually nice melody. Both his and Joe Cocker&apos;s version will suffice nicely until Ray Charles gets around to it.
Paul McCartney and Ray Davies are the only two writers in rock and roll who could have written ""Maxwell&apos;s Silver Hammer,"" a jaunty vaudevillian/music-hallish celebration wherein Paul, in a rare naughty mood, celebrates the joys of being able to bash in the heads of anyone threatening to bring you down. Paul puts it across perfectly with the coyest imaginable choir-boy innocence.
Someday, just for fun, Capitol/Apple&apos;s going to have to compile a Paul McCartney Sings Rock And Roll album, with ""Long Tall Sally,"" ""I&apos;m Down,"" ""Helter Skelter,"" and, most definitely, ""Oh! Darling,"" in which, fronting a great ""ouch!""-yelling guitar and wonderful background harmonies, he delivers an induplicably strong, throat-ripping vocal of sufficient power to knock out even those skeptics who would otherwise have complained about yet another Beatle tribute to the golden groovies&apos; era.
That the Beatles can unify seemingly countless musical fragments and lyrical doodlings into a uniformly wonderful suite, as they&apos;ve done on side two, seems potent testimony that no, they&apos;ve far from lost it, and no, they haven&apos;t stopped trying.
No, on the contrary, they&apos;ve achieved here the closest thing yet to Beatles freeform, fusing more diverse intriguing musical and lyrical ideas into a piece that amounts to far more than the sum of those ideas.
""Here Comes the Sun,"" for example, would come off as quite mediocre on its own, but just watch how John and especially Paul build on its mood of perky childlike wonder. Like here, in ""Because,"" is this child, or someone with a child&apos;s innocence, having his mind blown by the most obvious natural phenomena, like the blueness of the sky. Amidst, mind you, beautiful and intricate harmonies, the like of which the Beatles have not attempted since ""Dr. Robert.""
Then, just for a moment, we&apos;re into Paul&apos;s ""You Never Give Me Your Money,"" which seems more a daydream than an actual address to the girl he&apos;s thinking about. Allowed to remain pensive only for an instant, we&apos;re next transported, via Paul&apos;s ""Lady Madonna"" voice and boogie-woogie piano in the bridge, to this happy thought: ""Oh, that magic feelin&apos;/Nowhere to go."" Crickets&apos; chirping and a kid&apos;s nursery rhyme (""1-2-3-4-5-6-7/All good children go to heaven"") lead us from there into a dreamy John number, ""Sun King,"" in which we find him singing for the Italian market, words like amore and felice giving us some clue as to the feel of this reminiscent-of-""In My Room"" ballad.
And then, before we know what&apos;s happened, we&apos;re out in John Lennon&apos;s England meeting these two human oddities, Mean Mr. Mustard and Polythene Pam. From there it&apos;s off to watch a surreal afternoon telly programme, Paul&apos;s ""She Came In Through the Bathroom Window."" Pensive and a touch melancholy again a moment later, we&apos;re into ""Golden Slumbers,"" from which we wake to the resounding thousands of voices on ""Carry That Weight,"" a rollicking little commentary of life&apos;s labours if ever there was one, and hence to a reprise of the ""Money"" theme (the most addicting melody and unforgettable words on the album). Finally, a perfect epitaph for our visit to the world of Beatle daydreams: ""The love you take is equal to the love you make ..."" And, just for the record, Paul&apos;s gonna make Her Majesty his.

47,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/achtung-baby-20th-anniversary-edition-189577/,"At the dawn of the 1990s, most of the biggest bands in the world – Def Leppard, INXS, Bon Jovi, Mötley Crüe, Poison – marched blindly into the new decade, releasing a watereddown retread of their last album. Not U2. Abandoning the stadium-size sincerity of LPs like The Joshua Tree, they went to Berlin, drew on krautrock and club music and created what Bono called ""probably the heaviest record we&apos;ve ever made"" – a barrage of irony, distortion and still-huge hooks.
This deluxe box set features both Achtung Baby and its spacedisco follow-up, 1993&apos;s Zooropa, along with B sides, remixes, previously unreleased outtakes and a Kindergarten disc, basically an early version of Achtung Baby. The best of the unheard tracks may be ""Down All the Days,"" an early version of ""Numb"" with Bono on vocals instead of the Edge. Others are more interesting than thrilling, like ""Oh Berlin,"" a soaring ode to the birthplace of Achtung Baby, and ""Heaven and Hell,"" a moody synth number with some unexpected doo-wop flavor. A few tracks on Kindergarten sound nearly identical to the final versions; others went through major restructuring: In its early form, ""One"" sounds like a campfire singalong. The bonus material is not essential listening, but since U2 rarely pull back the curtain on their creative process, it&apos;s fascinating to hear this rough draft of history.

48,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/achtung-baby-251325/,"Having spent a good part of the Eighties as one of the most iconic bands in the world, U2 hardly needs to resort to a cheekily absurd title to draw attention to its first album in three years. Then again, subtlety has never been one of the group&apos;s virtues. In its early days and in its basic musical approach — a guitar, a few chords and the truth, to paraphrase one of Bono&apos;s more garish assertions — U2 fell in with other young bands that cropped up in the wake of punk. But U2 immediately distinguished itself with its huge sound and an unabashed idealism rooted in spiritual aspiration. At their best, these Irishmen have proven — just as Springsteen and the Who did — that the same penchant for epic musical and verbal gestures that leads many artists to self-parody can, in more inspired hands, fuel the unforgettable fire that defines great rock & roll.
At their worst ... well, the half-live double album Rattle and Hum (1988) — the product of U2&apos;s self-conscious infatuation with American roots music — wasn&apos;t a full-out disaster, but it was misguided and bombastic enough to warrant concern. With Achtung Baby, U2 is once again trying to broaden its musical palette, but this time its ambitions are realized. Working with producers who have lent discipline and nuance to the group&apos;s previous albums — Daniel Lanois oversees the entire album, with Brian Eno and Steve Lillywhite assisting on a number of songs — U2 sets out to experiment rather than pay homage. In doing so, the band is able to draw confidently and consistently on its own native strengths.
Most conspicuous among the new elements that U2 incorporates on Achtung are hip-hop-derived electronic beats. The band uses these dance-music staples on about half of the album&apos;s twelve tracks, often layering them into guitar heavy mixes the way that many young English bands like Happy Mondays and Jesus Jones have done in recent years. ""Mysterious Ways"" is a standout among these songs, sporting an ebullient hook and a guitar solo in which the Edge segues from one of his signature bursts of light into an insidious funk riff.
Elsewhere, as in the fit of distortion and feedback that opens ""Who&apos;s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses,"" Edge evokes the cacophony and electronic daring of noise bands like Sonic Youth. Indeed Edge&apos;s boldness on Achtung is key to the album&apos;s adventurous spirit. His plangent, minimalist guitar style — among the most distinctive and imitated in modern rock — has always made inspired use of devices like echo and reverb; his shimmering washes of color on ""Until the End of the World"" and soaring peals on ""Even Better Than the Real Thing"" and ""Ultraviolet (Light My Way)"" are instantly recognizable. But other tracks find the guitarist crafting harder textures and flashing a new arsenal of effects. On the first cut, ""Zoo Station,"" he uses his guitar as a rhythm instrument, repeating a dark, buzzing phrase that drives the beat while his more lyrical playing on the chorus enhances the melody. Similarly, ""The Fly"" features grinding riffs that bounce off Adam Clayton&apos;s thick bass line and echo and embellish Larry Mullen Jr.&apos;s drumming.
Bono&apos;s task, then, is to lend his sensuous tenor and melodramatic romanticism to expressions that match this sonic fervor. He announces on ""Zoo Station"" that he&apos;s ""ready to let go/Of the steering wheel""; what follows are the most fearlessly introspective lyrics he&apos;s written. In the past, U2&apos;s frontman has turned out fiercely pointed social and political diatribes, but his more confessional and romantic songs, however felt, have been evasive. On Achtung, though, Bono deals more directly with his private feelings — not to mention his hormones. ""The hunter will sin ... for your ivory skin,"" he sings on ""Wild Horses,"" and boasts on ""Even Better Than the Real Thing"" that ""I&apos;m gonna make you sing/Give me half a chance/To ride on the waves that you bring.""
Almost as surprising, and even more affecting, are Bono&apos;s reflections on being an artist. On ""Acrobat,"" over an arrangement that recalls the apocalyptic frenzy of ""Bullet the Blue Sky,"" he pleads for inspiration: ""What are we going to do now it&apos;s all been said?"" On ""The Fly"" self-doubt gives way to self-indictment: ""Every artist is a cannibal,"" he sings in a whispered groan, ""every poet is a thief."" Squarely acknowledging his own potential for hypocrisy and inadequacy, and addressing basic human weaknesses rather than the failings of society at large, Bono sounds humbler and more vulnerable than in the past. ""Desperation is a tender trap,"" he sings on ""So Cruel."" ""It gets you every time.""
That&apos;s not to say that U2 has forsaken its faith or that Bono has abandoned his quest to find what he&apos;s looking for. On the radiant ballad ""One,"" the band invests an unexceptional message — ""We&apos;re one/But we&apos;re not the same/We get to carry each other"" — with such urgency that it sounds like a revelation. Few bands can marshal such sublime power, but it&apos;s just one of the many moments on Achtung Baby when we&apos;re reminded why, before these guys were the butt of cynical jokes, they were rock & roll heroes — as they still are.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203865.15/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325092147-20190325114147-00262.warc.gz
49,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/acid-queen-96920/,"Tina Turner&apos;s attempt to recreate the excitement of five rock classics by the Rolling Stones, the Who and Led Zeppelin never really had a chance. She sings at least one of them, ""Let&apos;s Spend the Night Together,"" as well as anyone this side of Aretha Franklin, even though she ruins a couple of the others (""Under My Thumb"" and Pete Townshend&apos;s title song) with the sheer shrieking bombast that has characterized too much of her recent work. But the primary flaw in the rock-classics side of Acid Queen rests not with the singer but with her producers, Denny Diante and Spencer Proffer. The arrangements here are the opposite of what seems sensible: cluttered with pointless string charts and synthesizer zips and zaps rather than reduced to their basics, which are much closer to Turner&apos;s normal style.
Even when Turner begins a song credibly, as with ""I Can See for Miles,"" the production falls apart before the end; her voice struggles to compensate, and fails. No voice could succeed.
The material also seems ill-chosen, given the enormous body of work from which to choose. For instance: Why Led Zeppelin&apos;s ""Whole Lotta Love,"" the original of which relies almost entirely upon the dynamic interplay between guitar and voice to succeed, rather than Bad Company&apos;s ""Feel Like Making Love,"" which, while expressing the same blatant sexuality, at least possesses a real melody? Why Townshend&apos;s ""I Can See for Miles,"" which in the original again relies upon dynamic interplay, this time between the guitar and drums, rather than — well, rather than almost anything else?
The four Ike Turner originals on side two are at least written in an idiom that the singer comprehends. If the best of them, ""Baby — Get It On,"" relies upon vocal discourse between the duo reminiscent of nothing so much as Sonny & Cher in blackface, it&apos;s still not nearly so pathetic as this once-great singer pushing herself through a series of songs without either desire or understanding.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202347.13/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320125919-20190320151919-00303.warc.gz
50,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/adore-107015/,"With each Smashing Pumpkins album, singer, guitarist and producer Billy Corgan has raised the bar for his grandiose ambition: to create the defining coming-of-age music for his generation. Gish (1991) packed a neopsychedelic arena wallop into its modest pseudoindie framework; Siamese Dream (1993) heralded the return of the multitracked guitar opus, a Boston album for the alternative nation; and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (1995) spread its farewell-to-youth concept over two rock-opera-length CDs. Heck, even this band&apos;s leftovers came out as a box set (1996&apos;s The Aeroplane Flies High).
So what&apos;s an auteur to do for an encore? In Corgan&apos;s case, he makes a weird little album that turns its back on the band&apos;s previous strengths and shrinks the Pumpkins&apos; sound. This isn&apos;t just a transitional record; it&apos;s a complete break with the past. Instead of stadium-size bombast, Adore dials down the volume to lullaby level. Instead of rat-in-a-cage rage, the new album overflows with heartsick valentines. Corgan doesn&apos;t break out his trademark yowl but sings with an almost androgynous delicacy, sometimes supported by little more than a piano or a guitar.
It&apos;s a startling strategy: For a comparable move, imagine that Bruce Springsteen had released his stark Nebraska after the towering Born in the U.S.A. For Corgan, Adore represents a deflating of expectations even as it broadens the boundaries of his band. If the Pumpkins seemed to be turning into stadium-rock behemoths on their last tour, the new album presents Corgan, bassist D&apos;Arcy and guitarist James Iha as pop changelings who are bolder, quirkier and more versatile than anyone may have imagined.
A handful of tunes employ Nitzer Ebb programmer Bon Harris for a spritz of electronica, notably ""Ava Adore"" and ""Perfect,"" which picks up on the synth-pop echoes of the 1996 Pumpkins hit ""1979."" But mostly the electronic textures are used to enhance this soundtrack for a sleepless night, with crickets chirping, asteroids drifting and lovers murmuring. It&apos;s the most intimate album the Pumpkins have ever made and also the prettiest, a parade of swooning melodies and gentle, unfolding nocturnes.
Corgan and company build their mood pieces out of the sparest elements: a Soft Cell-style drumbeat on ""Tear,"" a handful of piano chords on ""Annie-Dog,"" the strum of an acoustic guitar on ""The Tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete."" The electric-guitar bombardment that was once central to the Pumpkins&apos; sound has been muted; the sole six-string showcase is a long, liquid solo on ""For Martha.""
In some ways, the album&apos;s more confiding tone can be viewed as a response to the departure of drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, whose splashy, storm-trooping way with a backbeat helped turn the Pumpkins into the altrock version of a fabulously overwrought muscle car. For Adore, the band called in a variety of percussionists, but they&apos;re allowed little more latitude than the drum machines. Instead of building towering highway anthems, the Pumpkins keep the songs only several steps removed from bedroom demos.
The shift in tone is as refreshing as it is unexpected. Corgan sounds more vulnerable than ever, his voice cracking with weariness on ""Annie-Dog"" and embracing a heavy-lidded sensuality on ""Shame"" and a desperate, heart-breaking optimism on ""To Sheila."" His music strives to preserve the beauty of that innocence, while his lyrics acknowledge its inevitable corrosion.
Corgan&apos;s aching romanticism — the sensitive soul sinking in the muck of the real world even as a better one fills his dreams — has been a constant theme of the Pumpkins&apos; records, and his lyrical imagery is packed with oblique, private longings and weighty, sometimes awkward conceits. But on Adore, the words — like the music — are more direct and frequently disarming in their beauty. On ""Shame,"" he exhorts a friend, a lover, perhaps himself, to persevere, and then offers solace: ""Love is good, and love is kind/Love is drunk, and love is blind."" The words are a soothing mantra, but the disorienting wobble of a distant guitar hints at irresolution.
With the closing seventeen seconds of solo piano music, Corgan amplifies that theme in even more compact fashion, this time without any words at all. Just as the lovely melody begins to lift off, it ends abruptly, as if Corgan is reminding his listeners that nothing should be taken for granted. Least of all his band.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202671.79/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322135230-20190322161230-00524.warc.gz

52,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/adrenalize-246667/,"Generally speaking, it&apos;s time to worry when the term long-awaited gets appended to an album. Long-awaited doesn&apos;t just mean that the band in question took its sweet time delivering the disc; usually, it&apos;s industry code for ""bloated and overblown.""
Except, that is, when the long-awaited release in question is the work of Def Leppard. This, remember, is the only major rock act that works more slowly than Bruce Springsteen. In fairness, the band&apos;s tardiness isn&apos;t entirely the product of foot dragging, as the death of guitarist Steve Clark undoubtedly slowed this album (and doubled fellow guitarist Phil Collen&apos;s workload) even more than the loss of drummer Rick Allen&apos;s arm complicated the completion of Hysteria.
Yet regardless of the time spent in the studio, Def Leppard&apos;s albums never seem especially labored or overwrought. If anything, the opposite is true — the band&apos;s music seems so effortlessly accessible that most listeners probably don&apos;t even notice the incredible amount of craft that goes into each release.
Nor is Adrenalize, with its insistence on intensely tuneful, unrepentantly frivolous material, likely to change that. There&apos;s no overriding concept to the album, no sense of the group&apos;s confronting its demons or wrestling with the problems of the world; instead, what we get is a seemingly unending string of energetic, hook-heavy, gosh-we-luv-&apos;em songs about girls. A perfect Def Leppard album, in other words.
That&apos;s not meant sarcastically, either. Because truth be told, it&apos;s far easier to prop up several couplets of self-revelation with a few heavy-metal riffs than it is to turn an idea as commonplace as romantic desire into a song as memorable as ""Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad."" But that&apos;s what Def Leppard does best, and Adrenalize is the band&apos;s most consistent effort to date.
Take ""Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad"" as an example. Although the title pretty much sums up the idea behind the tune, the band is wise enough to recognize that when it comes to love songs, what gets said matters far less than how it gets said. Thus, the heart of the song is its melodic development, the way Joe Elliott&apos;s vocal builds from the breathy, low-key opening verse to the soaring, full-throated harmonies of the chorus. It&apos;s so perfectly paced that you hardly need to hear the lyrics to understand what the song is saying; the sound says it all.
That&apos;s typical of Def Leppard, though. From the first, this was a band that gloried in the power of heavy metal&apos;s musical gestures — the towering majesty of a power riff, the momentary freedom of a guitar break, the exhilaration of a singer&apos;s scream — and as the group has grown, its ability to manipulate that vocabulary has expanded to the point that its songs have become mini-masterpieces of aural impact.
Just listen to all the sonic detail crammed into the album-opening ""Let&apos;s Get Rocked."" Although rhythmically the song is an obvious descendant of ""Pour Some Sugar on Me,"" playing off a throbbing Rick Savage bass line, stylistically it&apos;s miles beyond the last album, full of puns (""Let&apos;s get the rock out of here""), special effects (when Elliott complains about his girlfriend&apos;s fondness for classical music, the band mockingly answers with a snippet of Beethoven&apos;s Fifth) and all sorts of stagy good humor. Yet the Leps work these gimmicks in so gracefully that they never interrupt the music&apos;s flow, acting not as unnecessary contrivances but simply as another level of hook.
And there are hooks of every sort on Adrenalize, from broad strokes like the gloriously harmonized chorus of ""Heaven Is"" to ear-catching details like the little yodel Elliott slips into ""Personal Property."" Adrenalize is so relentlessly catchy that it almost seems as if the band is about to abandon its heavy-metal roots for the greener fields of hard pop. That&apos;s not to say the album is any softer than its predecessors — certainly the crunchy guitars of ""Tear It Down"" or ""Make Love Like a Man"" are proof to the contrary — just that it&apos;s not as noisily aggressive.
Consider that a sign of maturity. After all, what made Hysteria and Pyromania worth returning to wasn&apos;t their fist-pumping energy but the unabashed tunefulness the band tied to that sheer force. Adrenalize simply makes that connection more explicit, proving in the process that Def Leppard is one of the catchiest bands in rock. And if that doesn&apos;t make Adrenalize worth waiting for, I don&apos;t know what would.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201885.28/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319032352-20190319054352-00025.warc.gz

He sings from the side of his mouth, seemingly straight from the heart — his every sigh, mutter, trill and moan worth 100 twenty-dollar words — yet it seems like he&apos;s just being Al. Which isn&apos;t to say that 1973&apos;s Call Me, now remastered to full luster, isn&apos;t about amazing singing, from phenomenal falsetto hollers to deep-throated innuendoes. Green delivers the seductive come-on ""You Ought to Be With Me"" with the righteousness of a holy man, and in ""Jesus Is Waiting,"" he cries out like a man trapped in an ecstatic experience that&apos;s both spiritual and carnal. Explores Your Mind is earthier: The great soul singer revels in zipperless sex (the almost whimsical ""One Nite Stand"") and longs for innocence (the doo-wop-haunted ""School Days""). The most poignant moment is ""The City,"" wherein Green, who in 1974 was already quite world-weary, rapturously describes the bright lights and fame awaiting him in a distant metropolis. When he was singing about it, even ambition sounded like an act of faith.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202199.51/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320024206-20190320050206-00081.warc.gz
60,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/al-green-is-love-95442/,"Al Green&apos;s latest LP would almost qualify as a concept album were it not for the fact that Green has been mining the rhetoric of romance ever since his first hits. If Al Green Is Love contains any surprises, they come in the treatment of his material, all of it original for a change. The kind of love portrayed in ""Rhymes"" is no simple Moon June affair, and ""Love Ritual"" summons eros as a frenzy of orgiastic salvation. Languid, serpentine phrases issue in unsettling shrieks, garbled fragments: ""I wanna sanctify with you baby."" There is a troubled urgency to Green&apos;s singing here that defies the epithet sweet.
It also dispels any notion of Green as a hostage of candied formulas. True, he is willing and able to dissect fluff; predictably. Al Green Is Love contains its fair share of soporific pleasantries. But Green, with the help of the Memphis Hi Rhythm Band, often manages to transfigure the most benign sentiments and endow them with an undercurrent of tension, as if the clichés concealed a hidden cargo.
It&apos;s a tricky game to play. As ""Take Me to the River,"" his most recent blues/gospel effort (on Explores Your Mind), convincingly proved, Green thrives on a wide range of material. Moreover, formulaic ballads frequently elicit desultory performances.
But Green, like many great figures in rock, is conservative. With ""Tired of Being Alone,"" he hit on a style which he&apos;s stuck to. The style is founded on Green&apos;s approach to romantic themes. His hesitant, understated enunciation, imperceptibly shifting to falsetto, coupled with the hypnotic rhythmic rapport he establishes with his bands evoke a bittersweet emotionality. And all these elements appear on ""Tired of Being Alone,"" captured in the spontaneity of their first creation.
If it seems unlikely that Green will ever cut a record as fresh as ""Tired of Being Alone,"" it&apos;s equally true that the refinement of a style brings pleasures of its own. Despite some weak spots, Al Green Is Love is undoubtedly Green&apos;s best album in several years, thanks to a rare unity of feeling and mood, and a refinement of style.
The record is alternately beguiling and bedeviled. Setting the pace throughout is the marvelous Memphis Hi Rhythm Band who have become perfect accompanists. Charles Hodges&apos;s organ alternately purrs warmly or hovers ominously; Teenie Hodges&apos;s guitar bubbles discreetly in the background, only to unfurl a stark blues lick (listen to his playing on ""The Love Sermon""). When the Memphis Horns join in, it&apos;s almost possible to ignore the watery strings that Green and coproducer Willie Mitchell insist on using (although they, too, have become a part of the style).
The focus remains on Green himself. With an assurance verging on mannerism, he caresses, then strangles every phrase, effortlessly twisting it to suit his fancy. He can be soothing and shy or threatening and coy. On ""The Love Sermon,"" his choked intensity says worlds about love wordlessly. When he overdubs a dryly miked falsetto harmony part the effect is subtly electrifying: There are few singers who have the equipment to rival this kind of impact.
Some critics nonetheless persist in arguing that Green lacks the virtuosity and fire of the great soul stylists of the Sixties, such as Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett. It is an inappropriate comparison. Following Sam Cooke, another great figure of black music in the Sixties, Green has struggled to establish a broadly based presence within American popular music, appealing to suburbanites as well as inner city and rural blacks; to this end, he has self-consciously shed the trappings of conventional soul, although his style remains steeped in the blues. And unlike Pickett, say, Green has succeeded in fashioning a resilient image that has left its mark on the well-scrubbed sentiments his lyrics convey.
Moreover, Green&apos;s image is nothing if not ambiguous. The violence that dogged the private life of Cooke, as well as Green, is not accidental either. Beneath the composed exterior, there is a consuming drive at work that ultimately must inform the music itself. Perhaps that is one basis of Green&apos;s power to fascinate, both as a man and as a singer. For if ""Al Green is love,"" then love, as ""Love Ritual"" hints, is a far more complex — and risky — emotion than the man&apos;s satin shirts and demure smile would suggest.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202530.49/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321172751-20190321194751-00260.warc.gz
61,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/album-review-charles-mingus-jazz-in-detroit-strata-concert-gallery-46-selden-750144/,"If you're going by the bare facts alone, Jazz in Detroit / Strata Concert Gallery / 46 Selden is strictly for Charles Mingus completists. Unlike, say, John Coltrane's recently unearthed Lost Album, Jazz in Detroit doesn't date from a pivotal period in the leader's career, feature an iconic lineup or introduce a wealth of unfamiliar repertoire.

But what looks marginal on paper turns out to be sheer joy coming out of the speakers, thanks in large part to Mingus' lesser-known yet enormously gifted sidemen: tenor saxophonist John Stubblefield, trumpeter Joe Gardner, pianist Don Pullen and drummer Roy Brooks. Even Mingus aficionados likely won't have heard this exact lineup, since only Pullen and Brooks worked with the bassist for more than a few months. Still, as heard in these performances of Mingus staples (""Pithecanthropus Erectus,"" ""Peggy's Blue Skylight,"" ""Orange Was the Color of Her Dress, Then Blue Silk"") and a couple rarities, their grasp of the core elements of the bassist's sound world — earthy swing; lush ensemble playing; roomy, impassioned solos — is extraordinary.

Pullen in particular nearly steals the show. The pianist would later become a star of the jazz vanguard, but at the time of Jazz in Detroit, one of his earliest documented performances with Mingus, he was still an up-and-comer. His prior experience playing everything from high-energy free improv to deep-pocket soul-jazz came in handy here. On ""Celia,"" a tender, melodious piece that dated back to 1957, his solo moves from crisp bebop to clanging, cyclonic expressionism and back, recalling the astounding technique of earlier Mingus pianist Jaki Byard. Later, underneath Stubblefield's solo, the pianist tosses little firecrackers of abstraction the saxist's way, urging his bandmate toward increasingly ecstatic peaks. And on a lengthy version of Duke Ellington's ""C Jam Blues,"" he leads Mingus and Brooks into a wild free-jazz interlude.

The set's more conventional moments are just as satisfying. ""Dizzy Profile"" — a piece apparently written for Dizzy Gillespie but not found on any other known Mingus recording — gives the players a chance to stretch out on an old-school ballad. Pullen plays a gorgeous rubato intro, leading into a dreamy, vocal-like theme led by Gardner. Solos by the trumpeter and Stubblefield show off each player's timeless laid-back lyricism. Likewise, on the 26-minute ""Noddin' Ya Head Blues,"" the whole band digs heartily into Mingus and Brooks' slinky groove. (Late in the performance, the drummer puts down his sticks for a charmingly folksy turn on musical saw.) These pieces show that while many of Mingus' peers had embraced plugged-in fusion by '73, the bassist was still more than content with the fundamentals of acoustic small-group jazz.

Beyond the music itself, which sounds generally excellent for a live recording, Jazz in Detroit also has added historical value. A series of between-set radio segments interspersed with the music offer a window into the lively Detroit scene jazz at that time. We hear MC Bud Spangler, broadcasting from on site, giving directions to the Strata Concert Gallery — the home of Strata Records, an important local label of the period that DJ and Jazz in Detroit project coordinator Amir Abdullah has spent years researching and reviving — offering free admission to anyone who can bring a backup amp down to the show, bemoaning the sparse attendance and plugging upcoming installments in the Jazz in Detroit series, which also featured Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett and hometown luminaries like the Contemporary Jazz Quintet, for which Spangler was the sometime drummer.

Spangler also sits down for an extensive interview with Roy Brooks. Mingus' then-drummer was a Detroit local and, as heard on this set, an outstanding player who by this time had also worked with jazz A-listers such as Wes Montgomery, Pharoah Sanders, Jackie McLean and Horace Silver. (Jazz in Detroit is sourced from Brooks' own tapes, provided by the drummer's widow, Hermine.) He describes the challenge of performing Mingus' ""very demanding"" music — no doubt more so because Brooks was stepping into a role most often occupied by the bassist's longtime drummer and musical soulmate Dannie Richmond — and the evolving audience for jazz at the time, marked by an influx of young fans who ""a couple of years ago were really into the acid-rock scene."" His generally optimistic tone runs counter to the standard wisdom that jazz was on the rocks in the early Seventies.

This supplemental material only amplifies the sense that Jazz in Detroit is a niche document. As a slice of life, though, shedding light on both Mingus' day-to-day activities during an overlooked period and the practice of jazz outside the New York limelight, it's a treasure. Beyond the context, the music speaks for itself. Even a listener totally unfamiliar with Mingus, not to mention his undervalued collaborators, could jump into Jazz in Detroit's time machine and feel right at home in the bassist's rich musical universe.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202188.9/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320004046-20190320030046-00518.warc.gz

But the saxophonist behind famously abrasive Sixties sessions such as Machine Gun has always been a more nuanced player than his reputation as an air-raid-siren screamer would suggest. That's why Sparrow Nights is a revelation. The 77-year-old German improviser has rarely sounded more vulnerable than he does on this set of atmospheric studio-recorded duets with American-born pedal-steel guitarist Heather Leigh, his frequent foil in recent years.

Many Brötzmann collaborators have engaged him in gladiator-style combat, as heard on another recent release from the saxist's aptly named power trio Full Blast. Leigh instead emphasizes negative space. Set against her echoey, meditative swirls or harsh, pealing distortion (textures she combines with otherworldly vocals on a new solo album), Brötzmann — blowing hoarse laments or rough wails on a bevy of reeds, from bass sax to contra-alto clarinet and his customary tenor — often sounds like he's interacting with the elements.

In the first line of ""Poor Edward,"" a tall tale of satanic possession and suicide on Alice, one of his two new records, Waits devours the victim&apos;s name with Shakespearean relish, stretching it out in a malignant growl, like a burned-out coroner showing you the dead body with a tired sweep of his arm. Waits&apos; ravaged voice surrendered all pretensions to melody ages ago; his throat is now pure theater, a weapon of pictorial emphasis and raw honesty.
Appropriately, Alice and Blood Money feature songs written by Waits and his wife, Kathleen Brennan, for a pair of stage collaborations with dramatist Robert Wilson: 1992&apos;s Alice, based on the sexual obsessions of the Victorian author Lewis Carroll, and 2000&apos;s Woyzeck, adapted from the nineteenth-century German play about a soldier driven to lunacy and murder. This is fertile darkness for Waits, who excels at putting a human face on the bizarre and finding redemptive cheer in flophouse woe. Except for the bodiless piano-playing hands in Alice&apos;s ""Table Top Joe,"" Waits keeps the outright freaks to a minimum. Instead, he turns his scarred baritone and gallows wit to straight talk on deep shit.
Blood Money is especially grim, a bitter suite about greed and moral bankruptcy. ""If there is one thing you can say/About mankind/There&apos;s nothing kind about man,"" Waits snaps in the bleak circus hop, ""Misery Is the River of the World."" In the rattling jig ""God&apos;s Away on Business,"" the dancing is all done on suckers&apos; graves. Alice is just as macabre in its details of destructive lust. But there are flickers of hope, too, such as ""Fish and Bird,"" a soft waltz about a love that defies reason and natural order, sung by Waits in an old salt&apos;s croon.
Written as theatrical scores, these records bloom on their own. They are also testaments to Waits&apos; gift for making tangible magic from odd clatter: dusky strings, mooing horns, ancient keyboards. The atmospheres around his voice are so vivid you feel like you&apos;re there with him in the diesel-scented fog of Alice&apos;s ""Lost in the Harbour,"" or burning both your asses on the fire and brimstone all over Blood Money.

65,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/alice-cooper-goes-to-hell-204825/,"The raw-edged sound and transparently vicious image of the original Cooper band required that Alice&apos;s voice be defiantly non-musical. At the onset of his solo career, however, ""Only Women Bleed"" convinced many that he could carry a tune. Not surprisingly, when Alice Cooper Goes to Hell reaches for dramatic impact, he displays a tasteful, if not terribly original, vocal sense. This is particularly true of ""I Never Cry,"" the album&apos;s obvious single.
As usual, it won&apos;t strain the imagination to envision Goes to Hell&apos;s stage production. Alice has been condemned to disco dance for eternity in a hell where the devil is a DJ with a voice like Barry White&apos;s. This owes more to Rod Serling than Dante, but it&apos;s suited to Cooper&apos;s performing abilities, and the narrative is much more sound than Welcome to My Nightmare&apos;s.
Unfortunately, while the plot benefits Cooper&apos;s lyrics, the music, written by guitarist Dick Wagner, seems an afterthought. (One notable exception is ""Go to Hell,"" a shouted chant dominated by the guitars of Wagner, Steve Hunter and John Tropea.) Unfortunately, Cooper has never been less threatening. All the machine-gun chords of Wagner and Hunter can&apos;t change the fact that his infamy was long ago expended.

Jim Morrison may have been rock&apos;s first performance artist; he&apos;d turn a concert into a theater of confrontation, urging audiences to the extremities as he pushed himself beyond all conventional standards of acceptable behavior. Alive, She Cried brings it all back home: the Doors&apos; impossibly strange and wonderful music, Morrison&apos;s drunken loutishness and his stabbingly sober poetics, and the brilliant, vivid sparking of a machine too mercurial to last.
Alive, She Cried — recorded around the world in 1968, &apos;69 and &apos;70 — might even be a worthier in-concert document than the double LP Absolutely Live. The band is sharper, Morrison is funnier, and both musicians and singer go for the gut on every song. They get down and bluesy on the Howlin&apos; Wolf standard ""Little Red Rooster"" (John Sebastian adding harmonica) and downright dirty — albeit tongue-in-cheek — on the garage classic ""Gloria"" (written by that other, Irish Morrison). Leaning heavily on the riff to Otis Redding&apos;s ""I Can&apos;t Turn You Loose,"" guitarist Robbie Krieger makes ""You Make Me Real"" rock harder than the studio original.
Elsewhere, Morrison plays the stoned poet, woozily reciting ""Texas Radio & the Big Beat"" as a lead-in to ""Love Me Two Times,"" interpolating ""Horse Latitudes"" into ""Moonlight Drive"" and expanding on the heady, hedonistic liberation of ""Light My Fire"" with some pungent, erotic recollections set in a cemetery. ""Light My Fire"" may be the Sixties&apos; finest song; here, it flares upward into an intensifying bolt of passion that crescendos with Morrison&apos;s archetypal scream — a scream signifying the communal orgasm of a generation and a decade and a band that would flame out and fall silent all too quickly.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202299.16/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320044358-20190320070358-00194.warc.gz

But if Jackson tries too hard to meet a standard of sexual frankness that&apos;s heightened in the four years since her last outing, she more than delivers her quota of hits. The title track swirls on the dizzying energy of a disco-era sample (""The Glow of Love,"" by Change), and the ballad ""Better Days"" ends the album on an irresistible note of uplift. And as she did with Joni Mitchell on The Velvet Rope, Jackson calls on a guest, Carly Simon, to reprise one of her signature hits. In this case, ""You&apos;re So Vain"" becomes ""Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song is About You),"" and amid its esteem-bolstering proclamations of sisterhood, the track breaks the news that Simon&apos;s original was not about Mick Jagger, as was widely rumored.
At thirty-five, Jackson is now an R&B veteran, and she&apos;s earned her stature not through innovation but through consistency. Each time out, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (with occasional help here from hip-hop producer Rockwilder) freshen up her sound just enough to make it current while honoring her roots in one of the first families of soul. All for You admittedly does not break much new ground, but it&apos;s just as fresh, familiar and appealing as you&apos;ve come to expect from Jackson, and that&apos;s no small achievement.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202510.47/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321092320-20190321114320-00020.warc.gz
71,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/all-n-all-255379/,"At their worst, Earth, Wind and Fire indulge in some of the most pretentious excesses in current black music. As on past Earth, Wind and Fire records, All &apos;n All is filled with leaded brotherhood platitudes, Star Trek sci-fi and stiffly poetic love songs. This sounds overwrought and depressing (and maybe it is). But there&apos;s a catch: I like the record, for like much current black music, All &apos;n All elicits a schizophrenic response. If the album represents some of the worst in black music, it also has more than its share of the best.
Earth, Wind and Fire&apos;s prime mover, Maurice White, is a former Chess Records session drummer, and his rhythmic sense is one of the group&apos;s redeeming features. The rhythm tracks on All &apos;n All are often enough to salvage the most convoluted and awkward lyrics. ""Serpentine Fire,"" a song about the spinal life-center philosophy of many Eastern religions, is a simple tango spiced by a subtle funk base and the incessant clanging of a cowbell. Other songs incorporate snatches of supple James Brown bass lines, delicate Latin beats and hard, insistent funk vamps.
White&apos;s production virtues don&apos;t end there, though. The lyrics of ""Fantasy"" (""Come to see, victory, in the land called fantasy"") may be hard to swallow, but the music is as close to elegance as any funk song has come. Voices and a light touch of strings suddenly appear over a choppy, propulsive track, swell and swoop, only to disappear at the snap of a finger and pop up moments later for an exciting, powerful finale. White also utilizes an odd instrumental mix that gives equal emphasis to percussion (except the bass drum, which is usually played down), bass, rhythm guitars and stabbing, staccato horn bursts. The result is light but substantial, and it&apos;s become a model for many other bands.
Escapism and fantasy are prominent in the lyrics of many soft-soul groups, but usually (intentionally or otherwise) they&apos;re used humorously, or at least with tongue in cheek. At times, Earth, Wind and Fire is also capable of such fluffy warmth; in fact, torchy love ballads sung by Verdine White, Maurice&apos;s brother, have become a recent trademark. Verdine often sounds like a straining Eddie Kendricks and here, on ""I&apos;ll Write a Song for You,"" which is distressingly close to MOR, he has the type of lush romantic vehicle that one wishes Kendricks still employed.
But that warmth isn&apos;t always felt, and despite the musical gloss, much of Earth, Wind and Fire&apos;s escapism seems unintentionally obsessive and desperate. It&apos;s easy to be seduced by the artfulness and grace of Earth, Wind and Fire&apos;s music and accept it for its craftsmanship and listenability. On that level, the group is challenging and fun. It&apos;s also easy to be cynical about a line like, ""Jupiter, come from the galaxy/I want to meet you, to make you free,"" which seems as potentially dishonest and escapist as shooting dope.
There&apos;s a strange contrast to be drawn between All &apos;n All and Sly Stone&apos;s There&apos;s a Riot Goin&apos; On. Riot was druggy, down and honest. All&apos;n All is flashy, bright and fanciful. Sly saw what he didn&apos;t want to see. The Earth, Wind and Fire album is like looking at yourself in the mirror and finding that nothing is there. Maybe that&apos;s what makes All &apos;n All so compelling — and scary.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202474.26/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320230554-20190321012554-00460.warc.gz

74,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/all-the-young-dudes-199713/,"Taking what does not belong to you is a crucial part of the process of creating rock & roll: Exploiting proven riffs, phrases and hooks, then adding a few twists of your own — that&apos;s how it works and that&apos;s how it&apos;s always worked. Only nobody made a big thing about it until Mott the Hoople came along. They&apos;ve never made any attempt to camouflage the sources of their music; on the contrary, they have glorified the practice of musical thievery. Mott&apos;s first album, on which the group introduced its felonious approach with furious, shameless abandon, is a genuine tour de force. The group took the specifics that the Stones used to create their drive and that Procol Harum used to get that thunder and flamboyantly superimposed these over a style that bore every plane and angle to be found in Dylan&apos;s ""Like a Rolling Stone."" And their song choices: Hearing some irreverent English punk doing a startlingly well-executed deadpan Dylan over a surging Highway 61 instrumental track on an old Sonny and Cher novelty tune is an experience as ironically apt — and as oddly touching — as the whole idea is ironically comic.
 
And if Mott the Hoople let its high-spirited plays on middle Dylan degenerate into heavy-handed near-obsession over the course of albums two or three, the group made up for it early this year with the rip-roaring Brain Capers. There was still a definite Dylanesque aspect in singer Ian Hunter&apos;s vocals and in the keyboard-cascade crescendos, but for the first time it was doled out with care rather than with the usual unchecked fury. Just as important, the group regained its sense of humor about itself and about its sources (the pairing of Dylan and the Tijuana Brass was especially nice).
But after four albums, the Hooples still hadn&apos;t gained much of an audience: Their label, Atlantic, unloaded them, and morale was so low that there was serious talk of calling it quits. At the critical moment, along came David Bowie, who liked the group very much and wanted to produce its next album. Bowie, who is as smart in the studio as he is flamboyant on stage, endeavored to help Mott tie up its few remaining musical loose ends with a much-needed commercial boost by supplying them with a finely written, brilliantly arranged single, ""All the Young Dudes,"" which seems likely to become Mott&apos;s first hit, adding to their image a modicum of trendiness they never would&apos;ve been able to cultivate on their own.
For the album, producer Bowie has taken thinning shears to Mott&apos;s wild, thick sound and given it a smoother, more streamlined shape. On All the Young Dudes, you won&apos;t find any more of those tracks that build unremittingly to full roars and so remain. The tracks here are of moderate length, and you can distinctly hear the individual elements throughout each. The first time through, I was surprised to find the group&apos;s treatment of the Velvet Underground classic, ""Sweet Jane,"" with its obvious powerhouse potential, subdued to the point of understatement. It doesn&apos;t hit you over the head and flail you as you&apos;d expect it to in Mott&apos;s hammy hands — it practically beguiles. By using a muted setting as he does here, Bowie lets heretofore unnoticed aspects of the band&apos;s approach come to the surface: Hunter is no longer just a clever impersonator — he&apos;s turned into a convincing singer, a fact that didn&apos;t register earlier because his voice was rarely separable from the group&apos;s enveloping sound. Hunter offhandedly strolls his way through ""Sweet Jane,"" with more than a trace of mannered Bowie inflection and Lou Reed talky Dylan-ness added to his own thoroughly Dylanized style.
Mick Ralphs, who along with Hunter has been responsible for most of the group&apos;s original material, is finally given some space to play his guitar apart from the rest of the group; his usually double-tracked guitar work is one of the album&apos;s strongest facets. Ralphs&apos; high, clean backing vocals, juxtaposed with Hunter&apos;s crude, personal singing, form a balanced, compelling vocal sound, and Ralphs&apos; lead vocal on his own ""Ready for Love"" is the best he&apos;s ever done.
Fortunately, Bowie has chosen not to tamper with the two most endearing qualities of Mott the Hoople: The group&apos;s irreverent, seemingly unconscious punk humor, and the closely related sense of knowing just what to rip off from whom and where to use it. The intro to Hunter&apos;s ""Jerkin&apos; Crocus"" will trick the inattentive into thinking they&apos;re hearing the Stones launching into ""Brown Sugar"" (although it develops into a crisp, appealing song on its own terms, featuring a just-right whhoo-oo-oo vocal embellishment following Hunter into the choruses, a nice touch the group would never have thought of without Bowie&apos;s help). The Stones steal gets your attention, as does the playing off of a Keith Richard-style tense, ringing guitar against a power-chorded Led Zeppelin guitar-bass boom in ""One of the Boys."" And what Hoople album would be complete without Hunter, back in full Dylan regalia, badmouthing some not-so-sweet young thing (""Mama&apos;s Little Jewel,"" by Hunter and bass player Overend Watts). The new element of sexual ambiguity may be in deference to the producer or in quest of attention, but whatever the reason it&apos;s almost as funny to hear this pseudo-Dylan struggle with sexual identity as it is to hear that other one hawking ""Golden Protest"" on the National Lampoon album.
Between the Bowie and Reed tunes, the two bows to the Stones, the latest variation on Highway 61 and the irresistible ""Ready for Love"" (there&apos;s also the haunting, sad Hunter ballad, ""Sea Diver,"" giving the album a somber, mystic ending), there&apos;s an extravagant amount of power-driven, hook-laden rock & roll on All the Young Dudes. Bowie deserves plenty of credit for the cleaning and refining, but he had plenty to work with. Now they&apos;ve got everything, and they&apos;re bound to make it on the strength of this record. I just hope they can take what Bowie&apos;s given them and move off in a direction of their own, rather than staying in his shadow. I also hope they never get so pleased with themselves that they try to be overtly ambitious or original. When it comes right down to it, you are what you steal, and Mott the Hoople has stolen extremely well.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203865.15/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325092147-20190325114147-00405.warc.gz

76,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/all-things-must-pass-97685/,"In those haylcyon days when Beatles did not have destinies, only personalities, and every Beatle fan had a favorite Beatle, John once satirized his mates as ""wide-eyed Paul, cozy Ringo, and skeleton George."" George, overshadowed as he was by two enormous egos, and lacking Ringo&apos;s openess, was the hardest to know. I remember him as shy, aloof, ""Don&apos;t Bother Me"" George, whose luck it was to come down with a sore throat on the group&apos;s first tour of the States, barely croaking out his best wishes and John&apos;s witticisms over Murray the K&apos;s airwaves; young, vulnerable George the craftsman, bent over his Gretch in concert, making sure that every lick was as good as it was on record; the perfectionist who would later dismiss the majority of Beatle music as ""rubbish""; briefly Haight — Ashbury George, with eyeglasses, like Lolita&apos;s, in the shape of valentines; humble George, Ravi Shankar&apos;s student; holy George.      Up until now, George has been perhaps the premier studio musician among rock band guitarists. From the electronic whine which began ""I Feel Fine"" to the break in ""Hard Day&apos;s Night"" to the crazed, sitar — influenced burst on ""Taxman,"" George exhibited an avant — garde imagination and a technical flawlessness, as well as the ability to stay within the bounds of a song, which has remained unparalleled.      Not surprisingly, his ambitions have remained unfulfilled by this role and what presumably has been welling up in him since at least Let It Be, perhaps since Meet The Beatles, comes pouring out on All Things Must Pass. It is both an intensely personal statement and a grandiose gesture, a triumph over artistic modesty, even frustration. In this extravaganza of piety and sacrifice and joy, whose sheer magnitude and ambition may dub it the War and Peace of rock and roll, the music itself is no longer the only message.      The lyrics are central. They are displayed prominently on the album sleeves and appear to have been written before the music. Often there are more syllables than notes, and lines have to be hurried in order to get it all in. Often too, there are unresolved sentence fragments (""Eyes that shining full of inner light""), funny word uses (""Another day for you to realize me""), and conscious attempts at literary effects (""beware of soft shoe shufflers/dancing down the sidewalks""). His words sometimes try too hard; he&apos;s taking himself or the subject too seriously, or, if the subject is impossible to take too seriously, he doesn&apos;t always possess the means to convey that impression convincingly.      The production is of classic Spectorian proportions, Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons. The sound is often so glossy and dramatic it is difficult not to be seduced by it, and one tries vainly to discover just what George&apos;s music would be without it--a futile and probably destructive exercise anyway. Everybody&apos;s favorite sidemen — Whitlock, Gordon, Radle, and Clapton — along with Klaus Voorman and Alan White, fragments of the Plastic Ono Band — play almost indistinguishably from the staples of earlier Spector production: Larry Knetchel, Joe Osborne, and Hal Blaine, on many of the tracks.      At its best, Spector&apos;s production is the sound of one instrument, the mind of its producer. Individual instruments, even vocals, perhaps because George is not a strong singer, don&apos;t count for much in this music. There is a monolithic sound which peculiarly reinforces the message of many of the songs. George&apos;s religiousity, his quest for egolessness, are fitting in a sound in which individual elements are subordinated to the whole. If Paul&apos;s studio is his home, George&apos;s is his cathedral.      In this context the two-sided jam lies outside the context of the rest of the record. It would have been interesting to hear how George improvises. Here, he&apos;s playing with Clapton and Dave Mason and a lot of other people. Eric takes over on lead much of the time but really it is often impossible to tell who&apos;s playing what. Most of it is the usual 4/4 three-chord bashings about, competent and often boring.      The songs themselves are a very mixed lot. There are the bopping early-Sixties tunes; songs either authored, co — authored or influenced by Dylan; Beatle music; and the new, dirge — like Harrisonian holy music.      ""What Is Life"" is an ambiguous number on which he is not really asking what life is, in the big sense, just ""What is life/without your love?"" The music is sweetness and light, pure Shirelles, until he throws us the curve, ""But if it&apos;s not love that you need then I&apos;ll/Try my best to make everything succeed."" Or ""My Sweet Lord,"" an obvious re-write of the Chiffons&apos; ""He&apos;s So Fine."" Here ""doo-lang"" is replaced by ""Hare Krishna"" — a sign of the times. ""Awaiting On You All"" is a Lesley Gore rave-up in which George manages to rhyme ""visas"" with ""Jesus.""      The Dylan stuff is uneven. Harrison and Dylan co-authored ""I&apos;d Have You Anytime,"" the album&apos;s opening cut, but the two together don&apos;t come up with much. There is also ""If Not For You"" and an inexplicable bit of C&W schlock, ""Behind That Locked Door"" (it has a lovely, lilting background vocal, though). One of the most wonderful cuts on the album, however, is the Dylan-inspired ""Apple Scruffs."" Done with harmonica and acoustic guitar, it sounds as if it was recorded while Spector was out for coffee. The song itself is George&apos;s affectionate appreciation of his famous fans, and the first, song of the Seventies to recapture those dewy-eyed Sixties.      The two vintage Beatle songs are ""Run of the Mill,"" a song of poignance and McCartneyesque lyricism and ""Wah Wah,"" a grand cacaphony of sound in which horns sound like guitars and vice versa.      Finally, defining the musical core of the album are George&apos;s brooding essays on living, loving, and dying. ""Ballad of Sir Franky Crisp (Let It Roll),"" with lots of ""Ye&apos;s"" to remind us it&apos;s a ballad, is both watery and oceanic. ""All Things Must Pass"" with its washed — out horns and cadence beat, is eloquently hopeful and resigned:      Sunrise doesn&apos;t last all morningA cloudburst doesn&apos;t last all daySeems my love is up, and hasleft you with no warningBut it&apos;s not always going to be this greyAll things must pass, all thingsmust pass away.      ""Beware of Darkness"" may be the album&apos;s best song. Musically enigmatic and strangely incomplete, it is both a warning and an affirmation:      Beware of sadnessIt can hit you; it can hurt you--Make you sore and what ismore, that isnot what you are here for.      There is a song of reincarnation, ""The Art of Dying,"" whose melody is borrowed from ""Paint It Black,"" and the lament ""Isn&apos;t it a Pity"" whose beginning is the broken thirds of John&apos;s ""I am the Walrus"" and whose end is the decadent, exultant last half of Paul&apos;s ""Hey Jude.""      Throughout All Things Must Pass, George acts as moral witness and proselytizer for a way of life. When he sings lines like ""You&apos;ve been polluted so long,"" or ""not too many people can see we&apos;re all the same,"" these lines, like those of ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" and ""Piggies,"" carry an air of sanctimoniousness and moral superiority which is offensive. Remarkably, he vindicates these lapses. Obeying the form of Sgt. Pepper, there is a reprise of ""Isn&apos;t it a Pity,"" which prefaces the big statement, ""Hear Me Lord."" Here George stops preaching, and, speaking only to a God, delivers a simple, but majestic plea:      Help me Lord pleaseTo rise a little higherHelp me Lord pleaseTo burn out this desire.      Beyond particular evaluations, this is an album of striking honesty and force, greater than the sum of its parts. Stylistically, it will have influence — the ""big"" sound, may be upon us — but beyond that it suggests the supportive structures, the philosophy and rituals, which up to now have been lacking in so much of contemporary music. George&apos;s criticisms are explicit: ""now I don&apos;t need no wah-wah / and I know how sweet life can be. / So I&apos;ll keep myself free of wah-wah."" Or, in ""Awaiting on You All""; ""You don&apos;t need a love-in ... to see/the mess you&apos;re in.""      As Leon Russell noted in a recent interview ""But in India [the music is] a religion, and the restrictions are known by everybody and they know what their participation is and it&apos;s just like a way of life."" George is fully aware of this phenomenon. All Things Must Pass is his effort to dedicate his music to it.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202131.54/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319203912-20190319225912-00213.warc.gz

80,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/aloha-from-hawaii-via-satellite-189076/,"My God! Another live album from my hero. He&apos;s turning them out as fast as he once made movie soundtracks. And with as little point, in view of the fact that the material, patter, structure and sound vary so little from record to record. On the other hand, they sell better than his current studio albums, and those haven&apos;t exactly been aesthetic triumphs, so maybe there is some logic to it.
Just the same, ""Suspicious Minds"" has been released live from Las Vegas, Madison Square Garden and Hawaii and not one of these versions comes close to the sheer artistry of the Memphis studio original. The live ""Burning Love"" is a mockery of Elvis&apos; best single since ""Suspicious Minds."" The ""American Trilogy,"" El&apos;s version of Mickey Newbury&apos;s simple but effective blending of ""Dixie,"" ""All My Trials"" and ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" doesn&apos;t generate anything near the power of actually seeing him do it.
In the enjoyable documentary Elvis On Tour he turns his performance into a visual drama. By contrast, the live recording magnifies the worst element of Elvis&apos; stage show — the simplistic horn arrangements, poorly performed — while the film magnifies the depth of Elvis&apos; commitment to the music.
I usually enjoy hearing him do the ballad staples he became identified with during the movie phase, especially the by-now haunting ""Can&apos;t Help Falling in Love,"" with which he closes each concert (and here given its worst recording yet). But when he strays into the pure Caesar&apos;s Palace repertory that includes ""What Now My Love,"" ""You Gave Me a Mountain,"" and ""My Way,"" depression easily crosses over the line into disgust.
As usual, Elvis trys his hand with some recently popular chart material; thus, a mediocre ""Something in the Way She Moves,"" and a bloated ""Steamroller Blues,"" only partially salvaged by some elegant James Burton lead guitar. The band is impersonal but astoundingly tight and professional throughout.
Charlie Gillett once noted that in his early records Elvis sang at the top of his vocal range but that soon after the move to RCA he started singing lower. The high notes were the mark of an innocently beautiful approach to rock & roll singing, the bass ones more symptomatic of his penchant for self-mockery. And on this album he seldom crawls past the middle register at all, a sure sign of what he&apos;s thinking about himself.
There are moments when he pushes past every fault of the format and generates not just smoke but fire — as on a rousing ""See See Rider.""

While the lyrics are packed with Cooper&apos;s ghoulish punchlines — Spider sizes up victims with come-ons like ""You look like you&apos;d fit in the trunk of my car"" and ""I&apos;ve got some Chloroform and handcuffs just for you"" — the music sorely lacks former longtime Cooper collaborator Bob Ezrin&apos;s bombastic production.

86,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/american-beauty-127772/,"For once a truly beautiful album cover is more than matched by the record inside. The dead just refuse to keep within any normal limits, and I hope that it stays that way for a long time. Workingman&apos;s Dead was a lovely album, lush, full, and thoroughly real in musical and lyrical content. American Beauty is a joyous extension of the last album. If possible there is even more care on vocal wok. Everyone in the band sings, and sings well alone and together.
A complete contentment shines through the vocal work on this album. A full contentment. The instrumentation is rich with sound that moves through, under, and into the listener. Damn it all, the album is American beauty, of the best possible kind. The positivity of the Dead just can&apos;t be kept down. Look at the cover. ""American Beauty"" can also be read as ""American Reality,"" thanks to Mouse Studios. If more of the American reality were this album, we&apos;d all have a lot more to be thankful for.
""Box of Rain"" takes plenty of time, and moves surely. The band isn&apos;t in any great hurry. Layers of music weave in seemingly simple patterns — deceptively simple patterns. Phil Lesh&apos;s singing is just right. The chorus is fine: ""A box of rain will ease the pain/And love will see you through."" ""Believe it if you need it/If you don&apos;t just pass it on."" Praised be Bob Hunter. Countrified Dead is so nice to listen to.
From ""Box of Rain"" they zip into ""Friend of the Devil,"" which is a snappy little country number, with some extremely fine bass and acoustic guitar interplay. Jerry Garcia&apos;s voice now makes him a perfect wobbly cowboy.
Pigpen drops by with ""Operator."" Pigpen songs are always enjoyable, because they&apos;re Pigpen songs. That would be enough, but they are often good too, which is an added bonus, and this one certainly is good. Pigpen growls as ever.
""Ripple"" and ""Brokedown Palace"" are coupled by a vocal chorus, a little reminiscent of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, but only in a complimentary sense. The songs meld together and are strongly pretty and sad, as is ""Attics of My Life,"" which has some very, very nice harmony work.
The two songs that come closest to being rockers on the album are ""Till the Morning Comes"" and ""Truckin."" ""Truckin"" is just the story of the Dead — going on the road, losing old friends, gaining new ones, trying to keep everybody happy, trying to play some nice music for people, and succeeding on all counts.
The Dead are getting pretty big commercially now, and if ever a band deserved it, it&apos;s them. They have given us all something to treasure with this album. It&apos;s one for now, and one for the kids in 20 years too.

87,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/american-dream-250725/,"American Dream fades out on the line ""Why not keep on singing anyway?"" — and that lackadaisical slogan seems to sum up the spirit in which the first Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young studio album since 1970&apos;s Déjà Vu was made. Despite pleasant melodies, the occasional interesting song and the signature harmonies, American Dream is, for the most part, a snoozefest.
The enervation at the heart of this album suggests that these four veterans found themselves washed up on the shore of the late Eighties and — after endless recombinations, solo forays and, in David Crosby&apos;s case, imprisonment and brushes with death — determined to cast their lot together and see what happened. The regrouping has done none of them much good. Even Neil Young, the only member of this quartet to have made records worth discussing in the past decade, indulges his worst tendencies. His populist protests (the title track and ""This Old House"") substitute, in varying degrees, sappiness, sentimentality and mean-spiritedness for conviction and insight, while his ballads (""Feel Your Love"" and ""Name of Love"") lapse into cliché and mere prettiness.
On a couple of tracks the group does manage to flash some muscle. ""Drivin&apos; Thunder"" — which amounts to Stills and Young&apos;s version of ""I Can&apos;t Drive 55"" — works up a galloping boogie beat, and Crosby&apos;s ""Nighttime for the Generals"" inspires Stills and Young to shoot sparks on guitar. Stills&apos;s jaunty ""Got It Made"" and Nash&apos;s atmospheric ""Shadowland"" succeed on their own modest terms.
Unfortunately, American Dream&apos;s most cringe-inducing moment occurs at its point of greatest ambition. ""Compass"" — Crosby&apos;s five-minute acoustic ballad of his struggle with addiction — is so strained in its effort to achieve poetry that it&apos;s more likely to generate laughter than sympathy. Gnarled lines like ""I have seized deaths door-handle/Like a fish out of water/Waiting for the mercy of the cat"" argue the lingering effects of the drugs Crosby has so bravely kicked.
Coproduced by the band and Niko Bolas, American Dream is sonically lucid, though the synthesizers used to lend the album a contemporary sheen sound hokey and forced — even, oddly, a bit old-fashioned. Finally, however, the record&apos;s main failing is its banality. Beyond right-minded generalities and lazy evocations of ""love,"" American Dream has nothing to say. At the end of the preachy, bombastic ""Soldiers of Peace,"" Nash and Young scream, ""No more.""

Or for good measure, he&apos;ll pour on a little Tom Petty or Graham Parker. It&apos;s not just Cougar&apos;s hoarse, choked tenor that sounds overfamiliar; his secondhand serenades to teenage titillation at the car wash and the Tastee-Freez have also been heard elsewhere.
Ordinarily, I wouldn&apos;t buy a used car from this man, but his fifth album does motorvate somewhat. The engine is a tight, unpretentious Indiana band, and Cougar, who produced American Fool with engineer Don Gehman, seldom lets it idle. Guitarists Larry Crane and Mike Wanchic know how to raise a ruckus, and drummer Ken Aronoff is good at interrupting it with an authoritative thump. No extra chrome clutters the arrangements, which are so stripped down that even the simplest touches are telling. Thus, the alternating slap of electric guitar chords and an acoustic guitar&apos;s tickle tease ""Jack & Diane"" into something far more memorable than Cougar&apos;s clichéd account of ""two American kids growin&apos; up in the heartland"" would otherwise suggest. And a little dab of chiming percussion lends to ""Close Enough"" a catchy distinctiveness that Cougar&apos;s vocal can&apos;t provide.

90,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/american-stars-n-bars-247894/,"Right now, I think it would be just about impossible to overrate Neil Young. In the last few years he has web the most avant-garde styles to the corniest of archetypes — and deliberately ignored the public&apos;s penchant for pasteurized product by rampantly (im)perfecting Bob Dylan&apos;s crude but spontaneous recording technique. Seething with psychic dynamite, his raw and passionate electric-guitar playing boasts a tactility and uniqueness unmatched by any guitarist since Jimi Hendrix. Young has written songs as sensitive and beautiful as any by the most fragile and aesthetic singer/songwriter, yet he has played life-and-death rock & roll with the delirious ferociousness of the Rolling Stones at their most sordid and seedy. Of course, he has been misunderstood too quickly.
Since After the Gold Rush (1970) and Harvest (1972), many erstwhile admirers have filed strong charges of morbid self-indulgence and drugged-out incomprehensiveness against the later LPs. In The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll, Janet Maslin wrote: ""With On the Beach, 1974, Tonight&apos;s the Night and Zuma, both from 1975, Young&apos;s progressively more rudimentary music did little more than reiterate the murkiness of his lyrics. His renunciation of artifice was so absolute it left him no room for either drama or tension."" In the New York Times, John Rockwell, in a highly favorable review, characterized Young as ""the quintessential hippie-cowboy loner, a hopeless romantic struggling to build bridges out from himself to women and through them to cosmic archetypes of the past and of myth."" Well, no.
Unless one understands the ""On the Beach""/""Motion Pictures""/""Ambulance Blues"" trilogy from On the Beach (and ""Don&apos;t Be Denied"" from Time Fades Away), one simply cannot write intelligently about Neil Young. But when one understands these songs, one begins to perceive the exciting possibility that perhaps Young is rock & roll&apos;s first (and only?) postromantic. That he knows something that we don&apos;t, but should. Indeed, I suspect that Young took one of the longest journeys without maps on record, never even slowed up at the point of no return, but somehow got back anyway, a better man with all senses intact. When nearly overwhelmed by marital difficulties and the death of friends, he apparently looked into himself and managed an instinctive or willed act of Jungian purification that put him somewhat safely on the far side of paradise, if not paradox. I&apos;m not saying he&apos;s happy, but who the hell is happy? For Young, being a postromantic probably means he still loves the war, but knows exactly how and where to invest his combat pay — he may lose it, but never hopelessly. Romanticism is a foreign country; they do things differently there. It&apos;s a nice place to visit, but I wouldn&apos;t want to live there. Too homicidal.
Having gotten through the more self-destructive aspects of romanticism, Neil Young certainly takes full advantage of his revisiting privileges, pointing out the highlights and contradictions of his itinerary to all who will listen. Perhaps only a man who has known the answers can really see both sides of the questions. At any rate, Young&apos;s Mona Lisa smile from the barroom floor on the curious American Stars &apos;n Bars isn&apos;t so much arrogant (""If you can&apos;t cut it/Don&apos;t pick up the knife"") as it is inclusive (""I know that all things pass/Let&apos;s try to make this last""). So inclusive, in fact, that the album can almost be taken as a sampler, but not a summation, of Young&apos;s various styles from After the Gold Rush and Harvest (much of the country rock) through On the Beach (the incredible ""Will to Love"") to Zuma (""Like a Hurricane"" is a worthy successor to ""Cortez the Killer"" as a guitar showcase), with a lot of overlap within the songs.
If one can divide American Stars &apos;n Bars into major and minor Neil Young, I think that it breaks down this way: ""The Old Country Waltz,"" ""Saddle Up the Palomino,"" ""Hey Babe,"" ""Bite the Bullet"" and ""Homegrown"" are excellent examples of country rock at its most pleasant and muscular. While these songs abstain from cloyingness and retain the artist&apos;s characteristic idiosyncrasies (Young is nothing if not quirky), they lack the necessary resonance to stand up to the LP&apos;s four masterpieces.
In ""Hold Back the Tears"" and ""Star of Bethlehem,"" two songs about how it feels when you&apos;ve just been left and didn&apos;t want to be, a corrosive view of love metamorphoses into hopefulness (""Hold back the tears and keep on trying/Just around the next corner may be waiting your true love""), with a final metaphor equating the inevitability of the quest for a meaningful relationship with the apotheosis of the religious experience.
Which leads right into the shining ""Will to Love,"" a song that flies into the face of reason by flaunting the seemingly ridiculous — the thoughts of the singer as a salmon swimming upstream — in order to gain the truly sublime. And it works. (When was the last time you heard something like this on record?) Starting with a typical Young epigram (""It has often been my dream/To live with one who wasn&apos;t there""), the song moves from the manic to the depressive (the two lines about ""a fire in the night"") to a combination of both (""Now my fins are in the air/And my belly&apos;s scraping on the rocks"") before homing in on the universal plight (""I remember the ocean from where I came/Just one of millions all the same ..."") and promise ("". . . but somewhere someone calls my name"").
If Young&apos;s triumph is that he will never lose the way to love, his need to locate that special someone can certainly cause tribulations. ""Like a Hurricane,"" with its gale-force guitar playing, is a perfect either/or, neither/nor description of a modern-day Gatsby caught between the tangible idea of transcendental love and the intangible reality of it. Everything is ""hazy,"" ""foggy,"" lit by ""moonbeam"" and ""the light from star to star.""
I am just a dreamerBut you are just a dreamAnd you could have been anyone to meBefore that moment you touched my lipsThat perfect feeling when time just slipsAway between us and our foggy trip
The first three lines imply that the singer&apos;s need to invent someone to love may be far greater than the someone he finds. One can infer from the last three lines that the feeling gained from the creation and the chance taken is undoubtedly worth it, no matter what the cost. Is there a happy ending? I don&apos;t think so. ""I want to love you/But I&apos;m getting blown away,"" Young sings. It&apos;s like Key Largo with feedback.
Although he may be circling in a peculiar and seemingly haphazard manner (some claim he has as many as nine unreleased albums), Neil Young has a very good chance to be the most important American rock & roll artist in the Seventies. Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Browne and others must be considered, of course, but I don&apos;t know anyone who goes after the essences with as much daring as Young. I don&apos;t know anyone who finds them like he does either.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204086.87/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325174034-20190325200034-00035.warc.gz

Americana is the first full-on Horse album since the underrated 1996 gem, Broken Arrow. Nobody skewers expectations like Young, so there’s a catch: Americana has no Neil Young songs, just folk standards like ""Oh Susannah"" and ""Clementine."" No clever curation or Harry Smith-style crate-digging; as Young says, ""They’re songs we all know from kindergarten.""
There&apos;s an undeniable WTF factor in hearing these Cub Scout singalong ditties drowned in guitar feedback and off-key yelling. But that&apos;s the goofball charm. The Horse beat up on ""She&apos;ll Be Coming ’Round the Mountain"" (here titled ""Jesus&apos; Chariot"") as if it&apos;s ""Like a Hurricane."" True, the doo-wop classic ""Get a Job"" is beyond their chops, and ""This Land Is Your Land"" gets spoiled with a kiddie choir. But they make the murder ballad ""Tom Dula"" roar like a lost cousin of ""Powderfinger,"" and Young sings ""Wayfarin&apos; Stranger"" with a surprisingly vulnerable high-lonesome twang. Now that he and the Horse are as far removed from Ragged Glory as Ragged Glory was from ""Mr. Soul,"" he’s got the right to sound weary.

92,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/amok-119223/,"When did Thom Yorke start having so much fun? For more than a decade, we knew him as rock&apos;s greatest miserablist, the kind of guy who spends the whole party glaring at everyone while trying his hardest to disappear completely. But lately he&apos;s been reborn – spinning rare hip-hop at fashionable West Coast clubs, growing out a long-hair-don&apos;t-care ponytail and leading Radiohead ever closer to dance music you can actually dance to. Witnessing his loose-limbed shimmy across the stage on their most recent tour was sort of like watching Pinocchio become a real boy, then scarf down a fistful of MDMA.
Now, crowning this remarkable transformation, comes the warmest, grooviest album Yorke has ever made – nine songs where next-level laptop science collides with wild, funky improvisation. Its roots go back to late 2009, when the singer first rounded up the handful of L.A. pals that he later dubbed Atoms for Peace: longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich on keyboards, top session drummer Joey Waronker, Brazilian percussionist Mauro Refosco and Red Hot Chili Peppers&apos; Flea on bass. The new gang performed the songs from Yorke&apos;s first solo disc, The Eraser, at a string of revelatory shows that fall and the following spring, giving the cerebral tunes an unexpected jolt into joyous physicality. But Yorke, who hates being predictable more than anything except maybe climate change, made us wait till now for an album.
It was worth it. One thing Amok makes very clear is that Atoms for Peace are a band, not just hired hands backing a star. The recording process began with three days of jamming in the studio, and you can hear those freewheeling origins in the juicy, spontaneous grooves that anchor the album. You can also hear the months of embellishing that came next, as Yorke and Godrich spliced, processed and overdubbed the initial jam tapes into a high-gloss psychedelic experience – an ultrahip DJ set for a warehouse rave on the moon. Surprises lurk around every corner of the miles-deep mix: bright flecks of West African guitar, chattering polyrhythms, synth swells that overwhelm the senses before fading away like last night&apos;s dreams. Driving it all forward are Flea&apos;s deftly looped bass lines, skipping from playful melody to rumbling menace as Yorke&apos;s voice weaves merrily around the beat.
Not everything about Yorke has changed; many of his lyrics are as sour and cryptic as ever (""Thin persecutors and twisted vistas/A horned reptile that has crawled upon the earth,"" from the luminous ""Judge Jury and Executioner,"" is a typical couplet). Even so, you can tell how much he&apos;s enjoying moonlighting with Atoms by the sheer pleasure in his voice – check the coy falsetto he slips into for the weightless electro-R&B ballad ""Ingenue,"" or the blissful way he bounces through the syllables of the title phrase in ""Stuck Together Pieces."" His vocals have a riffy, casual feel seldom found on Radiohead&apos;s records. Even on 2011&apos;s beat-heavy The King of Limbs, Yorke took himself far more seriously. For now, he&apos;s living in the moment, getting lost in the rhythm, having a very good night.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202804.80/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323121241-20190323143241-00361.warc.gz

97,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/and-then-nothing-turned-itself-inside-out-191430/,"In the rock & roll book of love, the miserable couples get to have all the fun. From Fleetwood Mac to X, countless bands have grooved to the static between two lovers ripping each other apart. But Yo La Tengo have spent their long and noble career proving there&apos;s another side to the story. Guitarist Ira Kaplan and drummer Georgia Hubley are married people who like each other, quite the rock & roll novelty. After fifteen years of making great music together, they&apos;re indie rock&apos;s most revered artists, and part of their appeal is their enduring, endearing bond as the Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward of the garage. They&apos;re the most creatively fierce married band mates in music history — well, except for maybe Missing Persons.
The Hoboken, New Jersey, trio&apos;s beautiful new album, And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out, is a quiet, delicate meditation on this bond. Kaplan and Hubley sing their most confessional, intimate lyrics ever, over whispery guitars, brushed percussion, vibes and organ drones. It&apos;s a spell of blissful, psychedelic make-out music, what Revolver might have sounded like if the Beatles had tried putting ""Here, There and Everywhere"" and ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" into the same song. Bassist-vocalist James McNew takes a supporting role as Hubley and Kaplan tell their love story, a testimony to a life of promises kept and burdens shared and secrets entrusted. Obviously, we&apos;re not talking top-of-the-pops material here, but it&apos;s the softer side of Yo La Tengo, with Kaplan cutting down on his famous guitar feedback for the finest batch of marital ballads since Lou Reed&apos;s The Blue Mask.
The last time Yo La Tengo got this heavily into atmospherics, on 1992&apos;s May I Sing With Me, they sounded dour and murky. But since then they&apos;ve learned the secret that has eluded keyboard droners from Tangerine Dream to Tortoise: Atmospherics are a dime a dozen compared with actual songs. And these songs are great — heartfelt, rugged, melodically sumptuous enough to keep unfolding after dozens of spins, full of folk-rock flesh and blood. In ""Last Days of Disco,"" Kaplan sings about his first dance with Hubley, his Everydude voice full of rapt wonder: ""And the song said, &apos;Let&apos;s be happy&apos;/I was happy/It never made me happy before."" They trade memories of their early days — Ira trying not to stare, Georgia wobbling on her platform shoes — with a narrative flair they&apos;ve never even attempted before.
The songs face up to the daily struggles of the adult conjugal mojo. But even in stark confessions like ""Tears Are in Your Eyes,"" it&apos;s inspirational to hear these two legendary hearts sticking up for each other musically when the lyrical going gets tough. And Then Nothing has its weak spots, especially the draggy opener, ""Everyday,"" and fans will miss the up-tempo rockers. But if Yo La Tengo&apos;s 1997 gem, I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One, covered every base like an indie Sign o&apos; the Times, And Then Nothing is their Lovesexy, picking one element of their game and taking it to places that neither they nor anybody else has reached before. The grand finale, ""Night Falls on Hoboken,"" is a haze of guitar twang that holds up for seventeen minutes without either climaxing or falling apart — kind of like a solid marriage, which is probably the point.
The best Yo La Tengo show I&apos;ve ever seen was one that got canceled a few years ago in Washington, D.C. After the club lost its electricity, the band just brought its acoustic guitars out to the sidewalk to do a few freebies for the faithful. They played the Ramones&apos; ""I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend"" as if it were a summer-camp memory, a folk song as ancient as ""Michael Row the Boat Ashore."" On And Then Nothing, they capture that same communal vibe, but with all their electricity intact. And while Kaplan and Hubley take the spotlight, the album is also a tribute to McNew (who makes his own dandy solo records under the name Dump). Couples need neighbors — or, rather, couples have neighbors, and if they&apos;re lucky, they get supportive friends like McNew, which is part of the story they&apos;re telling here.
There&apos;s no point pretending that this album will make Yo La Tengo rich and famous. But if the connection between rock & roll and romance still means anything to you, if guitars play a key role in your bodily chemistry, if you don&apos;t gag at the idea of record-collector geeks having sex, and if you don&apos;t turn the page as soon as you read the words ""influenced by the Velvet Underground,"" And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out will open you up to intense new pleasures. Sometimes the lovers really are more fun than the fighters.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203493.88/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324210143-20190324232143-00477.warc.gz

99,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/another-passenger-246634/,"""Cowtown,"" a song Carly Simon has written for Another Passenger, tells the story of a cagey French woman named Simone Swann who marries a Texas millionaire for his money, and because she&apos;s lonely. In the second verse, Swann prepares to accompany the Texan to his native land, and Simon notes:
She packed up all her perfumeFor the gusty pioneerOn a carefree note he said ""forget your coatThere&apos;s a chill about every ten years.""
The use of the word ""gusty"" here is a small revelation, and the phrasing of the ""carefree note"" is perfect. This is the sort of lucid, humorous and concise observation for which Randy Newman, say, would be praised to the skies. I&apos;ll venture a guess that Carly Simon won&apos;t be huzzahed for her verbal dexterity and wit, however. If past reviews are any indication, a goodly number of her notices will consist of arch compliments of the gams displayed on the back cover.
Another Passenger is Carly Simon&apos;s best record. The sniffs of ""So what?"" that that assertion may provoke are exactly what Simon is confronting with this album. Her tenure with producer Richard Perry left many with the feeling that she had given herself over to his very particular musical vision, and the music that resulted — ephemeral and repetitive for the most part — was more Perry&apos;s failure than Simon&apos;s. Whether that impression is accurate or not, it is an embarrassingly obvious example of the cliché of a woman allowing herself to be manipulated by a man or men who know ""better,"" or more, than she.
This also represents a misunderstanding of Simon&apos;s modus operandi. Throughout her career she has surrounded herself with those whom she hopes to use (and I mean ""use"" in its best and worst senses — employing someone&apos;s talents and manipulating that person&apos;s talents to one&apos;s own ends) to articulate a world view that has never been prominent in popular music; i.e., what it&apos;s like to be a very attractive, independent, upper-class woman.
Prominent among those used people are men: Perry, whose lush slickness impressed her as a good musical equivalent to her lyrical glides; writer Jacob Brackman, whose arch irony suited her Joan Didion-ish despair; and James Taylor, whose sleepy folky sexiness offset her crackling urban eroticism. Passenger relinquishes Perry, opting for Ted Templeman, and uses Taylor mainly as a backup vocalist.
In addition to the aforementioned ""Cowtown,"" the finest song she has written, equally entertaining are a pair of Simon/Brackman compositions, the loping, slick ""Half a Chance"" and a tropical thumper (via Van Dyke Parks&apos;s arrangement), ""Darkness &apos;Til Dawn."" The duo&apos;s other offering, ""Riverboat Gambler,"" is precious in the way Brackman&apos;s writing often becomes without a hefty slice of Simon&apos;s down-to-earthiness. The only glaring failure here is ""Libby,"" an overlong banality.
Doobie Brothers Jeff Baxter and Mike McDonald are omnipresent to great effect. Simon has chosen to record the strongest song on the Doobies&apos; latest album, ""It Keeps You Runnin&apos;,"" and her smoky, tough vocal even manages to improve it.
True, Carly Simon has produced a lot of average music, but what is more important is that she has never abandoned her original themes, something she might easily have done at any time. Simon is not a very original songwriter. Her melodies are similar; often her lyrics seem as if she had not worked very hard at them, taking the first clever rhyme that came to mind. But at her best she conveys the monied angst of the leisured with moving conviction, something no one else has ever done. Additionally, she is always further explicating and enhancing an exploration of her ego and her sexuality. It is extraordinary for a woman to say without a speck of self-consciousness or irony, as she does here on ""In Times When My Head,"" that she ""Know[s] none could compare with me/In my airy skirts and cool retreats.""
This may not seem like much to radical prose writers, but it is still jolting stuff for pop music.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202781.83/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323101107-20190323123107-00406.warc.gz

The performances are immediate and invigorating, often in spare, buoyant arrangements with clear, virile singing. Despite the vintage, or maybe because it&apos;s all been hidden for so long, everything here feels like new music, busy being born and put to tape with crisp impatience. ""Let&apos;s just take this one,"" Dylan says before a take of the traditional ballad ""Little Sadie,"" one of 17 raw, magnetic tracks from a single three-day sprint with guitarist David Bromberg and pianist Al Kooper in March 1970. Dylan was, in fact, on the verge of a crossroads: the widely scorned double LP Self Portrait, issued three months later. He sounds eager to get there.
That album is still tough going: a frank, confrontational likeness of the artist at 29 and loose ends, crooning folk tunes, pure corn and odd, plaintive originals, mostly through thick Nashville syrup. There may be no better description of Dylan at the close of his first, whirlwind decade, exhausted and uncertain of his way into the next, than Self Portrait&apos;s opening mantra, sung in his place by a group of country-gospel angels: ""All the tired horses in the sun/How&apos;m I supposed to get any ridin&apos; done?""
Self Portrait and the country-folk assurance of its late-&apos;70 follow-up, New Morning, were actually part of a long, connected act of self-examination and re-ignition. Most of Another Self Portrait comes from those sessions, highlighting Dylan&apos;s breadth of drive at a time when many thought he had no direction forward. The horns on this set&apos;s ""New Morning"" are busy in the verses but a delightful Stax-like reveille in the chorus, while a pre-overdub version of Self Portrait&apos;s ghost story ""Days of &apos;49"" has more room for the haunting in Dylan&apos;s voice. ""I contemplated every move, or at least I tried,"" he sings in a moving take of ""Went to See the Gypsy,"" effectively summing up this period in a line he then cut from the song on New Morning.
Dylan was no writing engine that year. The few previously unissued originals here are quirky pleasures (the shaggy-dog dada of ""Tattle O&apos;Day""). But the music is consistently alive and astonishingly modern. The honky-tonk walk ""Alberta #3"" could have been cut for last year&apos;s Tempest. The exploration of different roads in the same song; the restorative power Dylan draws from traditional sources like ""House Carpenter,"" a song in this set that he first cut in 1962: Dylan still makes his best work that way. The difference here: He did it, then gave us something else.
A deluxe edition of this set has Dylan&apos;s 1969 Isle of Wight concert with the Band, a romping affair (excerpted on Self Portrait) that, except for the mileage on Dylan&apos;s voice now, doesn&apos;t sound that distant from his shows of the past 20 years. There is also a remastered Self Portrait, an instructive bonus if you&apos;ve never heard it. But you won&apos;t go back to it that often.

102,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/anthem-of-the-sun-190819/,"On the Grateful Dead&apos;s Anthem of the Sun the studio with its production work dissolves into live performance, the carefully crafted is thrown together with the casually tossed off, and the results are spliced together. The end product is one of the finest albums to come out of San Francisco, a personal statement of the rock aesthetic on a level with the Jefferson Airplane&apos;s After Bathing at Baxters. To be sure, the album has its weak points, but as a total work it is remarkably successful, especially when compared to the first Dead album.
The first side of Anthem of the Sun is a masterpiece of rock, ""That&apos;s It for the Other One"" and ""New Potatoes Caboose"" being particularly noteworthy. The main theme of ""Other One"" is an eminently memorable quasi-county melody that starts right off with the tasteful guitar of Garcia that dominates the record; a second movement starts the confusion between live and studio (nice stereo production work here), fading into a restatement of the main theme; then there is some beautiful musique concrete leading into ""Caboose."" Already there is evident carefully arranged vocal work, a departure from the Dead&apos;s previous release. The end of ""Caboose"" is a driving solo by Garcia that builds into structured frenzy thanks to Lesh&apos;s bass, the drums of Hart and Kreutzmann, and especially Garcia&apos;s masterful playing. Garcia is that rarity among rock guitarists, a thoughtful phraser who logically constructs his solos in a manner not unlike a capable jazz musician. Together Lesh, Weir and Garcia (along with McKernan&apos;s fat globs of organ) produce a complex, tight sound that stands with the best hard rock around.
Kazoos open ""Alligator,"" which is that kind of song, hardly dead serious. But it includes another fine Gacia solo; Lesh shows here as elsewhere that he is a fine bass player, while Hart and Kreutzmann work together to form one of the most powerful (and inventive) percussion units in rock. With ""Caution (Do Not Stop on Tracks)"" we are confronted with the album&apos;s most curious track, which ranges from a white-imitation blues riff vamp-until-ready to 60-cycle hum and microphone feedback. The vocal sounds like Danny Kalb (poor in other words), but this in fact is the main consistent problem with the album: the vocals. Often the voices are muddy and on blues none of the Dead sound particularly persuasive; but this is a minor quibble when so much else is right on this album. The mixture of electronic and serious music achieved by Edgar Varese on ""Deserts"" stands as one of the most impressive achievements in this area; on their own terms the Dead have achieved a comparable blend of electronic and electric music. For this reason alone Anthem of the Sun is an extraordinary event. It&apos;s been over a year since the first Dead album. It was worth waiting.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204768.52/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326014605-20190326040605-00223.warc.gz
103,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/anti-194522/,"For much of 2015, repeated delays and a lack of solid information started to make Rihanna&apos;s Anti feel like pop&apos;s mythical creature. Now that we know it&apos;s real, we can hear the singer&apos;s eighth LP for what it is: a sprawling masterpiece of psychedelic soul that&apos;s far more straightforward than its tangled rollout. The three full years since 2012&apos;s Unapologetic – the longest break between releases in Rihanna&apos;s career – turned out to be exactly what she needed to make a rich full-length statement. After more than a decade as a superstar of the singles chart, Rihanna has become an album artist.
Anti is first and foremost an experience built on vibes. Where previous LPs were built around clear peaks, here the songs fit together into a fluid landscape of seamless transitions – check the flow on the excellent mid-album run of after-hours joints from ""Desperado"" to ""Woo"" to ""Needed Me."" Every song sounds like our collective fantasy of Rihanna: a carefree island girl lounging in a cloud of smoke, asserting a brand of independence that&apos;s wholly her own. On ""James Joint,"" she assures us that she&apos;d ""rather be/Smoking weed/Whenever we breathe/Every time you kiss me"" in her most dulcet tones. ""You been rollin&apos; around/Shit, I&apos;m rollin&apos; up,"" she asserts on the biting kiss-off track ""Needed Me."" Clearly, the stoned party goddess we&apos;ve seen on Instagram and Snapchat is pretty close to the real Rihanna.
Anti&apos;s beats are more muted than the flashier productions of her past work, which leaves room for the album&apos;s biggest revelation: Rihanna&apos;s show-stopping vocal performances. One year ago, on one-off single ""FourFiveSeconds,"" she belted in a raw, raspy tone that expressed levels of soul the previous decade of her career had only hinted at. Here, she follows through on that promise, singing powerfully and with a deeper emotional density than she&apos;s revealed before. On the bluesy late-album highlight ""Higher,"" when she sings ""This whiskey got me feelin&apos; pretty"" over a dusty strings sample from producer No ID, she could be crooning in a smoky post-war jazz club.
Rihanna serves up a one-two punch of left-field choices in the album&apos;s second half, giving doo-wop a modern spin with ease on ""Love on the Brain"" and ­finding a new hypnotic pull in a Tame Impala song on ""Same Ol&apos; Mistakes,"" Anti&apos;s most shocking track. It&apos;s a faithful take on Australian psych-pop mastermind Kevin Parker&apos;s 2015 tune, but Rihanna&apos;s mellow vocals make it worlds more inviting and compelling.
At her core, though, she&apos;s still a hitmaker. Single ""Work"" isn&apos;t even her best collaboration with Drake – that would be 2011&apos;s expansive house ballad Take Care"" – but it&apos;s an impeccably catchy glide across a subtle, syrupy dancehall beat. The sexy, deep synth-pop of ""Desperado,"" meanwhile, could easily make it a club hit by summer; and Rih has her Purple Rain moment on the shimmering, funky ""Kiss It Better,"" which serves as the album&apos;s most direct pop moment by far.
Ultimately, Anti&apos;s sound is more than just another new costume for a singer who&apos;s dabbled in everything from flirty teen-pop to aggressive trap over the last decade-plus. This is an album that forces us to question the boxes we&apos;ve placed Rihanna in all along. Is she queen of the clubs or a break-up balladeer? Are her pop instincts sharper than her hip-hop ones? The answer, as provided here, is all of the above and more. After years as a singer largely defined by her production, it finally feels like Rihanna is in charge of her own sound, remaking pop on her own terms. As she puts it bluntly on the glitchy groove ""Consideration,"" which opens the LP: ""I got to do things my own way, darling.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204086.87/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325174034-20190325200034-00148.warc.gz
104,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/antichrist-superstar-203279/,"The rise of Marilyn Manson marks the end of the reign of punk realism in rock & roll. This ill-behaved Florida-based quintet, a visual and aural shake &apos;n&apos; bake of mutilation theatrics, Alice Cooperesque camp and metal-scraping-metal tonality, is a volatile reaction to five years of earnest, post-Nirvana rock. As ghoulishly animated as the Tales From the Crypt comic strip and gory enough for today&apos;s discriminating ambulance chaser, Marilyn Manson offer total escapism as a true alternative, complete with carefully crafted gloom wear (no baggy shorts allowed), a frontman who blatantly begs to be in the spotlight and lyric imagery rivaling that of the best slasher movies.
And not only do the Mansons — whose core members include the band&apos;s male namesake vocalist and leader, guitarist Twiggy Ramirez and keyboard player Madonna Wayne Gacy — look post-mortem fabulous, they also rock. The group&apos;s third and most accessible album draws on the orgasmic din of death metal, the mechanized assault of hard-core industrial rock and swaggering FM-pop trash a la Def Leppard. The combination is sure to terrify impressionable children, scare the bejesus out of their concerned parents and, most important, attract disgruntled teens like moths to a porch light.
Antichrist Superstar is on Trent Reznor&apos;s Nothing label and is co-produced by the Nine Inch Nails mastermind; Rez-nor also plays on several tracks. But musically, Marilyn Manson are the fun-house flip side to NIN&apos;s suffocating introspection. While Reznor emerges as a button-pushing nerd once the music subsides, you get the sense that Mr. Manson — who wears body accouterments that look like medieval prostheses and more melting makeup than Tammy Faye Bakker — actually kicks around the house in that gear.
Manson&apos;s convincing freakishness is just one of many reasons why Antichrist Superstar is an alluringly nasty piece of work. The lurid grind of the mock-live opener, ""Irresponsible Hate Anthem,"" sets a fine example for all the bad behavior to follow: ""I am so all-American, I&apos;d sell you suicide."" In the catchy ""1996,"" Manson recites a list of conflicting personal and political philosophies — ""Anti-choice/Anti-girl ... anti-sober/Anti-whore"" — and then offers himself as the simple solution. ""Anti-people, now you&apos;ve gone too far,"" he sings, ""Here&apos;s your Antichrist superstar."" The ever-present Alice Cooper influence is full-blown in ""Tourniquet."" It is also here that Manson divulges his idea of a perfectly seductive date — ""She comes on like a crippled plaything.""
The suspense-filled ""Beautiful People"" offers enough ooh&apos;s and ah&apos;s to fuel an entire Hammer horror film. The song has a zombielike, repetitive quality, with ghostly electronic sounds that whoosh by like stale air blowing through ancient catacombs. Manson, in turn, hisses his lines, punctuating certain words with a shrill, insane pitch, others with a retching scream. In the morose death march ""Cryptorchid,"" the even gets a little sentimental, recalling the sweet days of his youth: ""When the boy is still a worm, it&apos;s hard to/Learn to count to the number seven.""
The layered effect of the music recalls that of Ministry, but Marilyn Manson&apos;s execution is not as dense. Instead, Antichrist Superstar writhes with a cool, sinister and taunting feel — eerie synthesizer-type whistles, heavy breathing, monster groans and grunts — before lurching out from the shadows with hammering percussion and static-loaded feedback. That dramatic jack-in-the-box ploy should have been used more often; some of the songs here are just too flat, leaving spaces of monotony on the record that feel like popcorn-fetching intermissions. For all of the album&apos;s attractions, the band could have compressed Antichrist Superstar into a more powerful blast of evil.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912206677.94/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326220507-20190327002507-00299.warc.gz

106,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/any-love-110630/,"On his sixth album in seven years, Luther Vandross sounds a bit fed up. As the most powerful and popular balladeer of the Eighties, he has doggedly defended romantic bliss, or at least the hope for it. Any Love might mark the end of that cycle, however, as some doubts start to creep in.
It&apos;s not that Vandross hasn&apos;t sung with or about anguish before — just that now almost all of his lovers are cheating, hesitant or invisible. He confronts a fair-weather love in ""Are You Gonna Love Me"" but never gets the resolution he seeks. His impatience bubbles over in a not-so-subtle crescendo on ""For You to Love,"" and he hits skid row on the title cut, randomly begging for anyone to tell him where he can find any love.
Vandross&apos;s disillusionment has no effect on the musicality of his voice: he tunnels down and still sounds tender; he slips in and out of falsetto in a heartbeat; he bends and twists notes most singers can&apos;t even grip. While musically he always lands on his feet, emotionally he falls squarely face down.
Vandross goes to the soul-chestnut well one more time for Major Harris&apos;s 1974 hit ""Love Won&apos;t Let Me Wait,"" which would seem to fit in nicely with the album&apos;s frustration theme. But in spite of Vandross&apos;s success with covers, he somehow misses the mark here. The appeal of the original ""Love Won&apos;t Let Me Wait"" was its boozy arrangement; Vandross transforms it into his usual marathon tour de force but somehow can&apos;t tie all the threads together.
There&apos;s no question that Any Love is as masterful an album as Vandross has made; it&apos;s probably only likable, though, for those who get off on severe bouts of melancholia.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912206677.94/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326220507-20190327002507-00459.warc.gz

Pigpen sings in a recognizable musical form, the harshness and seediness of which is not fundamental to the Dead. The music behind him and all around him is so tasty (as in ""Love Light"" where the rhythmic structuring builds in unimaginable waves to melodic insensibility), so rich with quivering energy that Pigpen can almost always be overcome. Pigpen ""fits"" because the Dead choose to embody a generosity of spirit that won&apos;t tolerate throwing him out. But the band is more magical because unnamable, less definable, without him.
Aoxomoxoa is the work of the magical band. Can you hear this music and not see them before your eyes? The music is so much the reality of their physical and spiritual bodies that seeing them is the wonder of seeing music. Phil Lesh&apos;s intensity and total dispatch driving his bass surpassingly, threading solidly, commandingly, laying line over line over line into the expanding spectrum of physical sounds that they are illuminating.

Tom Constanten, the keyboard man coming into his own with vibrant riffing and subtly chiming embellishments. And out front of these perfectly interweaving, very together people is Jerry Garcia&apos;s luminous guitar stroking.
The singing is mostly Jerry — a dominant and exquisite person emanating serene unconsciousness and tenderness. Trembling, sensual, whimsical tenderness. Jerry is beautiful; not too serious, not too sweet, not too angelic, but not ordinary, not surrendered to a style. Jerry&apos;s voice is emotional and musical in the same-non-verbal way that flesh is tender and loving real. If you can feel, he can reach you. The gentle choir, the dancing mountain harpsichording, the mystical aura of another consciousness — reflections of rain and sand and sitting mellow in warm sunlight smiling.

113,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/aqualung-189561/,"Dating from at least the Electric Prunes&apos; Mass In D Minor, rock and religion have evinced an unlikely affinity for each other. Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer, Peter Townshend, John Lennon, George Harrison (and let us not forget the Reverend Richard Penniman) have all at some point dedicated themselves and their music to God in his myriad varieties. On the heels of Tommy and Jesus Christ Superstar, Jethro Tull&apos;s Ian Anderson joins this heady list.
 
Tull is one of our most serious and intelligent groups, and Anderson&apos;s choice of subject for Aqualung — the distinction between religion and God — is witness to that. Further, Tull has a musical sophistication to match its thematic ambitions. Where This Was, their first album, was aimless and disorganized, Stand Up, with its dabbling in ethnic and classical forms, was eclectic in the best sense. Out of that experimentation was forged in Benefit a sound which finally provided the band with a concrete identity.
Once a group has arrived at a coherent style, the next logical step is a concept album, and it is on the shoals of concepts that many a band runs aground. Often such albums lack the hint of self-irony, which is basic to great rock and roll, and therefore come off sounding pompous. Ultimately an album like Tommy, for example, must stand or fall on its quality as a collection of songs; the thematic gloss is absolutely secondary.
Aqualung is the album&apos;s lead character, and is so named for his rheumy cough. Side one consists of a series of seedy vignettes drawn from modern secular English life, while the printed lyrics are cast in Gothic lettering to emphasize the album&apos;s liturgical basis. The title song depicts the beggar in all his shabbiness and lechery. ""Aqualung"" is actually three songs; as the different moods of the narrator unfold, the music changes accordingly. The initial melodic statement sung in a harsh, surly voice is ugly and plodding; it then shades into something milder and more sympathetic, then into something which rocks a little more.
Another of society&apos;s dregs, cross-eyed Mary the slut, of the song of the same name, is the object of Aqualung&apos;s attentions. Anderson sounds equally disapproving here. ""Mother Goose"" is the kind of song that Anderson writes best. As in ""Sossity"" on Benefit, he uncannily captures the feel of a real Elizabethan madrigal (a consort of recorders here helps it get across). It&apos;s a song about a Hampstead fair, and is filled with descriptive detail which is at once archaic and up to date. Lyrics and melody mutually accomplish the same purpose, for both express the continuity of English life.
Side two, subtitled ""My God,"" deals more explicitly with religion. The nub of the issue is Christian hypocrisy, how people manipulate notions of God for their own ends. There is some rather obvious talk of plastic crucifixes, Blakean allusions to locking ""Him in His golden cage,"" and invective; ""The bloody Church of England/In chains of history/Requests your earthy presence at/The vicarage for tea."" Beneath the accusatory tone is a moving musical theme. Again, the structure is constantly shifting. There are stately hymnal changes, a jazzy flute break, a pomp-and-circumstantial motive which, when inverted, assumes a more chromatic, modern queasiness. The gamut of religious experience is encompassed in this song.
""Wind Up"" winds up the album and embodies most of the album&apos;s difficulties. While Anderson is adept at conceiving a musical approximation of an idea, his lyrics are overly intentional, ponderous, and didactic. It would be possible to ignore the lyrics, as lyrics can usually be ignored, except that Anderson sings them so melodramatically. Nor is his theatricality appropriate to the ideas or words. The over-enthusiastic delivery is probably meant to compensate for his inherent vocal limitations, but the original problem is Anderson&apos;s choice of subject. At a time when the more arcane varities of religious experiences are trumpeted far and wide, and atheism and agnosticism still more than hold their own, it is difficult for the modern temper to get worked up over good old-fashioned Christian hypocrisy. When Anderson sufferingly sings —
So I asked this God a question and by way of firm reply,He said ""I&apos;m not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays.""So to my old headmaster (and to anyone who cares);Before I&apos;m through I&apos;d like to say my prayers — ""I don&apos;t believe you: you got the whole damn thing all wrong — He&apos;s not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays.""
— there is something depressingly anti-climactic about it all. There is a lot of misplaced emotion on this record.
Thus, despite the fine musicianship and often brilliant structural organization of songs, this album is not elevated, but undermined by its seriousness.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201904.55/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319052517-20190319074517-00171.warc.gz

The centerpiece comes early: ""Your Love Is Killing Me"" is a six-minute dirge opening with funereal organ and a laundry list of violent fantasies that build to guitar crescendos. ""Taste blood/Everybody needs to feel,"" she sings, sounding like Tilda Swinton sipping O-positive in last year&apos;s arty vampire film Only Lovers Left Alive. The palette is less guitar-centered than Van Etten&apos;s 2012 breakthrough, Tramp.

116,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/are-you-alone-101268/,"Devon Welsh is the lightning inside Canada&apos;s Majical Cloudz, a coiled bolt of emotion whose out-sized oversharing often captures in a lyric the precise moment where you either fall head over heels in love with someone for their vulnerable bravery, or lurch for the door. ""Can I try to be you?"" he sings plangently in ""Control"" over droning organ and what sounds like a spatula thwacking a cookie sheet. ""Can I dress up in your clothes and be somebody new?"" Even when he breaks the spell with a winky stage aside (""I like it when the song goes slow""), it&apos;s haunting, sexy, head-trippy stuff.
Dissecting love&apos;s power dynamics and identity panics is a venerable synth-pop tradition, from Throbbing Gristle to Eurythmics, Depeche Mode to Grimes (a.k.a. Welsh&apos;s ex-girlfriend, Claire Boucher). Are You Alone? furthers that tradition, taking the voice-and-electronics minimalism of the group&apos;s 2013 breakthrough, Impersonator, and stripping it back even further, leaving the vocals alone for a more unmediated delivery. It&apos;s an improvement: Welsh has a potent voice, with a drama king power recalling Mark Eitzel, Leonard Cohen, even Neil Diamond, and the fact he avoids histrionics only makes it more powerful. (He&apos;s the son of a fairly intense actor — Kenneth Welsh, known for his role in Twin Peaks — so this talent could be partly genetic.) Bandmate Matthew Otto&apos;s shimmering backdrops, meanwhile, have only become more tuneful and inviting.
This streamlined approach may have something to do with Majical Cloudz&apos;s rising star: Lorde took them out recently as opening act for her arena tour, which probably invited broader strokes into their alt-pop performance art. ""Downtown"" knowingly works a diffuse metaphor that can range from heaven to hell (Neil Young has used it for both). Here, it&apos;s enlisted in a love song that namechecks the Beatles&apos; ""I Want To Hold Your Hand,"" contemplates death, and makes a pledge that smacks of hyperbole, but that&apos;s heartswelling all the same. Similarily, when Welsh repeats ""You gotta learn to love me"" on ""Heavy,"" it&apos;s both plea and passive-aggressive demand, and it&apos;s easy to imagine his listener is willing to learn. His ability to pack the simplest sentiments with layers of uncertainty makes him a pop act worth rooting for.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202698.22/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322220357-20190323002357-00555.warc.gz
117,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/ariana-grande-thank-u-next-album-review-793887/,"Ariana Grande is a woman of her word, dropping her new album just six months after her last one—and Thank U, Next turns out to be her best album yet. Sweetener was full of potential hits; the old-school model would have been to milk it for a couple of years, tour it to death, then start the cycle all over again. Instead, Grande went back in the studio while her energy was raging and banged out another album in two weeks. This is her Amnesiac to Sweetener’s Kid A. The theme is basically, “Break up with your music industry, I’m bored.”

Sweetener was an ambitious artist crafting a self-consciously wide-scale pop statement. Thank U, Next is just a woman and a mood, taking that mood out for a drive until she pedal-to-the-metals it right off a cliff. What a glorious pop rush it is—the album version of one of those emergency break-up karaoke sessions with a few therapeutic hours of Mary J. Blige and Toni Braxton songs.

“Lately I’ve been on a roller coaster/Trying to get hold of my emotions,” Ariana confesses in “Needy.” By “lately,” she seems to mean since she first tasted oxygen, and by “get hold of my emotions” she means turning her emotions into a spectacular, larger-than-life mess. She’s been through the ringer in the past two years—the Manchester bombing, Mac Miller’s death, a whirlwind engagement that turned into a messy public split. Thank U, Next is her response, reflecting her new determination to move fast and keep it spontaneous. “My dream has always been to be . . . obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does,” she told Billboard in December. “It’s just like, ‘Bruh, I just want to fucking talk to my fans and sing and write music and drop it the way these boys do.’”

When she surprised the world with “Thank U, Next” last fall, no one was expecting more than a quickie celebrity-shade novelty, yet it turned out to be a ballad with astonishing grace and resonance—and the whole album is up to that level. She’s going for the off-the-dome energy of a hip-hop mixtape: no guest stars, no duets. She works with her most trusted collaborators, like Max Martin, Tommy Brown, Victoria Monet, Tayla Parx and Pop Wansel. As she sings in “Ghostin’,” her surprisingly candid ballad about death, grief and recovery, “I’m a girl with a whole lot of baggage.”

It’s strange to go back and listen to “Dangerous Woman” from just three years ago, back when Ariana sang about needing a dude to make her feel dangerous. Picture that. Well, those days are gone—this Ariana needs danger lessons like she needs an extra ponytail. Like she sings in the excellent “Makeup,” “Let me stay in my bag, ‘cause I like when you mad/It’s a mood, it’s a vibe, it’s a look, it’s a match.”

“7 Rings” bites The Sound of Music, but it’s much cooler than that time Gwen Stefani did “The Lonely Goatherd”—Ari fuses trap and Maria Von Trapp, from the Alps to the ATL. Yet it’s not really a song about expensive jewelry and bubbly. At heart, it’s a song about treating yourself and your friends like superstars even if nobody else notices. It’s her version of Cher's “But mom, I am a rich man” speech. “NASA” is her excellent space-oddity ballad about her emotional solar system and the way her orbit changes over time; “Fake Smile” samples the Wendy Rene dusty soul groove “After Laughter,” a hip-hop touchstone via the Wu-Tang Clan.

“Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored” is a perfect song title in the tradition of Britney’s “Get Naked (I Got a Plan),” with Max Martin and a clever interpolation of the 'NSync deep cut “It Makes Me Ill.” It’s the perfect way to end this album—after crying her tears and screaming her screams and feeling her feels, Ari flirts with the bartender on her way out, ready for more punishment. This is one of the year’s best pop albums so far, even in a 2019 that’s already turning out to be a great one for new music. Thank U, Next makes you suspect that the best Ariana is yet to come.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202642.32/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322094932-20190322120932-00053.warc.gz
118,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/armed-forces-194069/,"Consider ""Oliver&apos;s Army,"" the pièce de résistance on Elvis Costello&apos;s Armed Forces, an album that&apos;s a killer in several senses of the word. The tune sounds bright and bouncy, with a jangly keyboard riff along the lines of ""Here Comes Santa Claus,"" and it&apos;s enough to make you want to rock around the room. But sit down, Fred, and get a load of the lyrics you&apos;re dancing to:
There was a Checkpoint Charlie  He didn&apos;t crack a smile  But it&apos;s no laughing party  When you&apos;ve been on the murder mile  Only takes one itchy trigger  One more widow, one less white nigger  Oliver&apos;s Army is here to stay  Oliver&apos;s Army are on their way
And I would rather be anywhere else than here today.
In fact, this is an angry song about imperialism and the military, reportedly written just after Costello visited Northern Ireland. In spirit and on its very congenial surface, ""Oliver&apos;s Army"" is a hit single. You can hear it one way, or the other way, or both. Elvis Costello doesn&apos;t seem to give a damn what you do, and that&apos;s no small part of his charm.
Costello writes songs that are elusive at times, bursting with bright phrases you can&apos;t always catch. (As someone who still thinks the Rolling Stones are singing ""Heartbreaker ... with your bowling ball,"" I&apos;m all in favor of half-audible lyrics that encourage a valuable do-it-yourselfism in the listener.) He sings about violence with a vibrant romanticism, and about love with murder in his heart. He writes short, blunt compositions that don&apos;t pretend to be artful, though they are, and don&apos;t demand to be taken seriously, even though they&apos;re more stunning and substantial than anything rock has produced in a good long while. He doubles back on himself at every turn, and you&apos;re forced to take it or leave it.
There&apos;s only one way to listen to Elvis Costello&apos;s music: his way. The songs are so brief they barrel right by, leaving an impression of jubilant and spiteful energies at war with each other. Every now and then, words like ""quisling"" or ""concertina"" leap out of nowhere to add to the confusion. Images are etched hard and fast, then replaced by new ones even stronger. There&apos;s an overload of cleverness on the LP — more smartly turned phrases than twelve songs ordinarily could bear. But the rapid pacing alleviates any hint of self-congratulation.
Costello&apos;s songs are dense the way Bob Dylan&apos;s used to be, driven by the singer&apos;s faith that if this line doesn&apos;t get you, the next one will, and compressed so tightly that they lend themselves to endless rediscovery. He has something like the younger Dylan&apos;s rashness, too, being hotheaded enough to oversimplify anything for the sake of a good line, and being a good enough writer to get away with it. His puns are so outrageous they&apos;re irresistible. In ""Senior Service"" (the name of an English cigarette): ""It&apos;s the breath you took too late ""It&apos;s the death that&apos;s worse than fate."" In ""Oliver&apos;s Army"": ""Have you got yourself an Occupation?"" In ""Chemistry Class"": ""Are you ready for the final solution?"" The first line on the record: ""Oh, I just don&apos;t know where to begin.""
Beneath all this gamesmanship lurks something like a grand passion, however unexpected it may be from a fellow who favors photographs that make him look like a praying mantis. The EP that accompanies some copies of Armed Forces (Columbia wants you to buy the album in a hurry, so they&apos;ll stop including Live at Hollywood High after the first several hundred thousand records) contains a live version of ""Alison"" that&apos;s so steeped in tortured love it makes the concert audience squeal. And the LP&apos;s final cut, ""(What&apos;s So Funny &apos;bout) Peace, Love and Understanding,"" is delivered with a sincerity bordering on desperation. The wise guy who can work Hitler into a song about competitive friendship (""Two little Hitlers will fight it out until/One little Hitler does the other one&apos;s will"") is also prey to authentic romantic agonies so exquisitely maddening they go hand in hand with danger.
Listen to ""Watching the Detectives,"" re-recorded in an almost playful version on the EP, with these show-stopping lines: ""Nearly took a miracle to get you to stay/It only took my little fingers to blow you away."" Or ""Party Girl"" (as in ""You&apos;ll never be the guilty party, girl""), with its alternating waves of passionate declaration and angry denial. No Elvis Costello love song is without its ax to grind or its hatchet to bury, but at least the emotion, however strangled, comes through. Costello never sounds exactly willing to give himself over to sentiment, yet he works hard to make himself more than marginally accessible: a gangster with heart. Without that bit of humanizing, he&apos;d be a specialty item. With it, he can be a star.
It hardly hurts that Costello&apos;s songs are never less than snappy, even when their drum parts are reminiscent of machine guns, or that Nick Lowe has produced him this time with a large and general audience in mind. Notwithstanding his Buddy Holly glasses and his Buddy Holly white socks, Elvis Costello refers most readily to the Sixties. And Lowe makes the most of this, filling Armed Forces with recycled lounge music (""Moods for Moderns""), Beatles-like codas and the trashiest organ lines this side of ""96 Tears."" Like the lyrics, these echoes run together in a quick, exciting jumble, so dense that the end of one number, ""Busy Bodies,"" can mix the phrasing of John Lennon and Paul McCartney&apos;s ""Nowhere Man"" with the guitar lines of Roy Orbison&apos;s ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" and the whoo-oos of the Beach Boys&apos; ""Surfer Girl."" Costello draws so heavily on the recent rock past that his reliance upon it amounts to a kind of cheapening, a repudiation. But that&apos;s only one more in a long line of quicksilver contradictions.
Right now, Elvis Costello serves as a feisty and furiously talented middleman, halfway between rock&apos;s smoothest sellouts and the angriest fringes of its New Wave. He wants to be daring, but he also wants to dance. He&apos;d like to seethe and sell records at the same time. He&apos;s mindful of — indeed, insistent upon — the form and its limitations: it&apos;s only rock & roll, after all. But he takes it to the limit just the same.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202658.65/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322115048-20190322141048-00094.warc.gz
119,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/around-the-sun-99541/,"The first few seconds of R.E.M.&apos;s Around the Sun nearly retrace the opening to rock&apos;s archetypal power ballad, Aerosmith&apos;s ""Dream On."" As the song, ""Leaving New York,"" continues, R.E.M. sound remarkably like multiplatinum-era early-Nineties R.E.M.— the band that knew how to combine diffuse lyrics and sonics with hooks and primal rock grooves better than anyone else.
On Around the Sun, that intrinsically R.E.M.-y vibe makes a tentative, muted comeback. Unlike 1998&apos;s Up, on which the band crafted beautiful but belabored studio experimentation, and unlike 2001&apos;s Reveal, where they relaxed but didn&apos;t deliver many memorable melodies, R.E.M. here resemble their classic selves. On its way back home, the band takes the road less traveled. ""The Outsiders"" coolly floats on a syncopated drum beat that comes to a premature stop, then starts again for Q-Tip to resolutely rap a noble third verse. ""Make It All Okay"" puts piano to the fore of a strikingly direct post-breakup song. ""Jesus loves me fine/And your words fall flat this time,"" Michael Stipe argues, rejecting a lover&apos;s offer to revive a relationship. On the title-track closer, the threesome builds to a humble climax, then fades away on a dreamy coda.
Around the Sun is full of what are ultimately anti-power ballads, the kind that question rather than bluster, favoring maybe over might. It&apos;s another slow, meandering CD from a trio that refuses to fake a full recovery in the wake of drummer Bill Berry&apos;s departure in 1997. It would be too easy for R.E.M. to ride Coldplay&apos;s coattails on a rock-anthem remedy. They&apos;d rather struggle on their own terms.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202474.26/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320230554-20190321012554-00033.warc.gz

121,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/arthur-or-decline-and-fall-of-the-british-empire-193113/,"""You look like a real human being but . . ."" ""He got feet/ Down/ below his knees/ Hold you in his arms yeah you can feel his disease . . .""
It&apos;s all over for England. They&apos;ve had their history and it&apos;s been written in books; they&apos;ve fought their wars and buried their heroes. The English have owned the world and jettisoned their empire, and all that&apos;s left is — rock and roll. ""England has got all the bad points of Nazi Germany, all the pompous pride of France, all the old fashioned patriotism of the old Order Of The Empire. It&apos;s got everything that&apos;s got nothing to do with music . . . the poxy little shit-stained island."" So said Pete Townshend.
And the Kinks&apos; answer, like the Band&apos;s answer to the American questions, is that a band makes its music out of whatever history has to offer. Arthur has the same guts as the Band&apos;s new album, that same reach back into the past, the same sense of age — like the Band, the Kinks can play the role of man near the end of his life when they themselves are merely in their twenties. Arthur is more fun, more cutting, and in the end simply hilarious because whatever England was, it isn&apos;t any more, and the Kinks are set free of all responsibilities. Christine Keeler died for their sins.
The Kinks are fun. Ray belts out ""Victoria,"" and manages to sound pompous and fat — just like the girl herself — while doing so. The band drops off all restraints and finally performs like a real rock and roll band instead of like a bunch of old ladies. Dave Davies takes solos with delightful horns as a back-up, not to display virtuosity (which he has) but because the songs are too much fun to stop. On ""Mr. Churchill Says"" the band moves effortlessly into a three or four part number, changing the tempo, the mood, and the melody while never losing a superb dancing beat. Many of the songs display that sort of genius: ""Shangri-la,"" ""Australia,"" and more. The complexity of the compositions doesn&apos;t intrude because these delights are composed, not constructed, as were ""Happiness Is a Warm Gun,"" ""A Day in the Life,"" or the collages on Abbey Road. The music&apos;s like a verbal and instrumental jam session with divine inspiration as a rhythm section.
The music will move anyone who listens, because there is such an enormous mount of pathos in what Ray Davies has done. He&apos;s presented the last hundred years of English history through the eyes of one little man who never meant a thing to the rest of the world — as if Sinclair Lewis had followed Babbitt from birth to death and then made it into a musical comedy.
Less ambitious than Tommy, and far more musical — no fillers, no waste tracks, not a matter of ideas but of perceptions worked out by bass, drums, voices, horns and guitars — Arthur is by all odds the best British album of 1969. It shows that Pete Townshend still has worlds to conquer, and that the Beatles have a lot of catching up to do.
Perhaps a week or two ago, a very wise kid shuffing about in an old pawn shop was approached by an aging but slick pawnshop keeper. The old man watched with amusement as the young longhair looked through all the shiny and not so shiny instruments hanging in the yellowed window and stuffed into the backroom.
""What can I do for you, young man,"" the keeper said, rolling back on his heels, his hands in his pockets, the standard toothpick hanging out of the corner of his tight dry lips.
""Looking for something to play,"" the kid answered with nary a glance up to the sly old man. The kid&apos;s fingers were busy threading their way into the darkest recesses of all the back corners of the room, in quest of some forgotten treasure.
""Ah,"" the shopkeeper smiled, rolling his eyes toward the ceiling. ""A tuba; perhaps, so you can join the high school band."" He paused chuckling for a second, and then leaned forward, his sallow eyes quickly ablaze, his voice close and whispering loudly. ""Or a guitar, an electric guitar, a Gibson Les Paul so you can make loud noises and maybe next week be a big star? Eh?""
The kid pushed the hair out of his eyes and grimaced at the pawnshop keeper. ""No,"" he said.
""No? That&apos;s not it?"" The old man drew back askance. ""You don&apos;t want to learn to play the guitar?""
""Naw,"" the kid answered without any apparent interest, adding what seemed mere token explanation. ""A lot of guys can play the guitar, and play it real well."" He was silent for a moment as his hand settled gently on an old red Les Paul Junior. The kid turned, looked up at the aging keeper, and said in a very strange and remorseful voice, ""What&apos;s the use anyway? And ten years after what could I do that a million guys can&apos;t do now?"" The kid smiled, obviously struck by something he had said. ""Ten Years After. Ha. Isn&apos;t that funny. I&apos;d almost forgotten."" And he laughed once more.
""Ha. Do you know what I said? Do you know that last week I was really tired of listening to the guitar, no matter who was trying to get it on?"" The hair settled back over his eyes, and the old man drew his hands from his pockets and cocked a thick finger under his chin. ""Clapton, B.B., Page, all of them. The same old stuff. They weren&apos;t moving, ya know? Refinements, not extensions. I really thought the days of the guitar were numbered."" The kid picked up the smooth red axe and plucked the metal strings lightly. ""Then I heard the new album.""
""New album?"" the old man quizzed, puzzled by the whole thing. ""What new album?""
""Sssh,"" the kid said with a smile, ""Ten Years After.""
""What?"" The man looked around suspiciously. ""When? Who?""
""Ten Years After,"" the kid said again.
""Ten Years After?"" the old man asked, furrowing his eyebrows. ""And whom pray tell is that?""
""Ten Years After is . . .""
There was a singularly long pause, with not so much as the blinking of an eye. The boy lowered the guitar to its resting place, and then added his last words.
""And Alvin Lee . . . I think perhaps he is God.""
The boy smiled at the old man for the final time and turned toward the front entrance. Just before closing the door, he paused and looked back in, still smiling, and said, ""What&apos;s left for me to do but pass the Word? Why do I have to play? Why does anyone? It&apos;s already been done.""
He closed the door and slipped out, humming an Alvin Lee run. A passing freak and businessman both nodded.
""Mellow,"" they said in unison.
""Yeh,"" the kid answered. ""Mellow.""
And as they moved by one another, the kid hoped that they understood, and were not just talking as so many are prone to do.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202525.25/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321132523-20190321154523-00413.warc.gz
122,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/artpop-86653/,"Lady Gaga is at her peak when she&apos;s playing the neon queen of all the world&apos;s outcasts. And with her constant prodding, her Little Monsters have filled the biggest big tent in modern pop. But in the five years since Stefani Germanotta&apos;s arrival, weird has become the currency that overwhelmingly fuels pop culture – from seapunk Tumblrs to American Horror Story. So for Gaga to stay on top in 2013, she has to keep cranking up the cray.
For better and for worse, Artpop meets the mandate. It&apos;s a bizarre album of squelchy disco (plus a handful of forays into R&B) that aspires to link gallery culture and radio heaven, preferring concepts to choruses. It&apos;s sexual but not sexy, filled with bitchy fashion designers and one-liners like ""Uranus/Don&apos;t you know my ass is famous?"" and ""Touch me, touch me, don&apos;t be sweet/Love me, love me, please retweet."" Gaga wants us to believe the LP was inspired by Marina Abramović, Jeff Koons and Sandro Botticelli; at its best, it sounds like it was creatively directed by RuPaul, Dr. Ruth, and Beavis and Butt-Head.
Artpop opens with four tracks of thumping futuresex/lovesounds where Gaga vows to lay her intentions, and body, naked. She cops a drag queen&apos;s arch humor on intergalactic journey ""Venus,"" examines sex and power on gothy grinder ""G.U.Y"" (which stands for ""girl under you""), and woos a lover whose ""boyfriend was away this weekend"" on the slinky ""Sexxx Dreams."" Yes, we can read her poker face.
But just as Artpop gets into a groove of high-tech Pop&B, her creative impulses splinter. She plays hook girl for Too $hort, Twista and T.I.&apos;s thugged-up, self-parodic ""Jewels N&apos; Drugs"" and falls for her own cutesy wordplay on the glammy ""MANiCURE."" The Rick Rubin-produced ""Dope"" is a turgid ballad about the slippery slopes of romance and drugs that lunges for Elton John and crash-lands near Meat Loaf.
Gaga&apos;s previous albums – 2008&apos;s electro-pop romp The Fame and its brilliant follow-up EP, The Fame Monster, and 2011&apos;s inventively nostalgic Born This Way – were largely the result of partnerships with producers RedOne and Fernando Garibay. Paul ""DJ White Shadow"" Blair worked on most of Artpop, but there&apos;s a pile-up of names in the credits including Zedd, Madeon, David Guetta, Infected Mushroom and Will.i.am. In the past two years, Gaga has split from her longtime stylist/choreographer and manager and canceled a world tour to recover from a serious hip injury. Could Artpop simply be a distraction obscuring the drama behind the curtain?
Ironically, Gaga redeems the LP with a pair of tracks that strip away the artifice in favor of plain sentiment: ""Do What U Want,"" a spectacularly growly and groovy R. Kelly duet, and ""Gypsy,"" an Eighties-style anthem where Gaga admits her love of performing and love of love often clash. ""I don&apos;t want to be alone forever, but I love gypsy life,"" she sings without abandon. Neither track is subtle, but they work because they weren&apos;t born from the chilly conceit that art and pop need an arranged marriage to get busy.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202199.51/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320024206-20190320050206-00543.warc.gz

She blew out of the London electro underground last year with her indie debut single, ""Galang."" M.I.A. chants the hook ""London calling/Speak the slang now"" while she plays with her cheapskate beatbox and amps up her minimal buzzes and bleeps into monstrously cool explosions. It sounds like Bow Wow Wow shooting bottle rockets into a vintage Ms. Pac-Man machine to scare the quarters out. M.I.A.&apos;s long-awaited full-length debut, Arular, is every bit as stunning as ""Galang"": weird, playful, unclassifiable, sexy, brilliantly addictive.
M.I.A. is Maya Arulpragasam, 28, a Sri Lankan artist who grew up in London after her family was forced to flee her nation&apos;s civil war. She wrote the songs for Arular on her trusty Roland MC-505 Groovebox, with producers such as Steve Mackey, Ross Orton and Richard X. There&apos;s nothing purist about her, as she hot-wires bhangra beats, dancehall toasting, Miami bass and old-school electro. In killer tracks such as ""Fire Fire"" and ""Amazon,"" she raps about political troubles, war and refugee life, in her own tough no-big-deal way. ""Sunshowers"" noises up an old 1970s disco hit with excellent rhymes (""I salt and pepper my mango/Shoot spit out the window"").

126,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/at-fillmore-east-188323/,"That rarity on the contemporary rock scene — an integrated group from the Deep South — the Allman Brothers Band has for a couple of years rivaled the Braves for Atlanta&apos;s affections the way the J. Geils Band stole the Red Sox&apos; following (a good part of it, anyway) in Boston. Wherever they play throughout the South, in fact, audiences seem to regard the Allmans as their own.
On the strength of their two previous albums and, more recently, a string of knockout live performances from coast to coast, the Allmans have come likewise to be known as ""musicians&apos; musicians,"" a band&apos;s band. In fact, the only criticism I&apos;ve heard from other musicians seemed quite frankly to have its roots very firmly in the time-honored practice of hollering sour grapes — over the last year the Allman Band played the Fillmores so frequently that some people were calling them Bill Graham&apos;s House Band.
Whatever else one may have to say about Graham, though, his taste in music has been largely unassailable, and hence it came as no surprise at all to anyone in the music business when Graham selected the Allman Brothers (and the Geils Band) to close out the Fillmore East.
The Allman Brothers had many fine moments at the Fillmores, and this live double album (recorded March 12th and 13th of this year) must surely epitomize all of them. The range of their material and the more tenuous fact that they also use two drummers have led to what I suppose are inevitable comparisons to the Dead in its better days. Any comparison to anybody is fatuous. In my opinion, the fact of the matter is that guitarists Duane Allman and Dicky Betts, organist-vocalist Gregg Allman, Berry Oakley on bass, and drummers J.J. Johanson and Butch Trucks comprise the best damn rock and roll band this country has produced in the past five years. And if you think I&apos;m dog-shittin&apos; you, listen to this album.
The first two sides consist of an all-blues set, with Duane setting the pace on slide guitar. Leading off with Blind Willie McTell&apos;s ""Statesboro Blues,"" the first side moves on into ""Done Somebody Wrong"" and ends with eight and a half minutes of one of the finest-ever versions of T-Bone Walker&apos;s ""Stormy Monday""; the second side is entirely devoted to Willie Cobbs&apos; ""You Don&apos;t Love Me,"" a cut on which everybody gets in his licks.
Side three is devoted to the group&apos;s tune ""Hot &apos;Lanta"" and nearly 13 minutes of ""In Memory of Elizabeth Reed,"" written by Betts, who plays lead. The version here is even better than the cut on the Allmans&apos; second album. Side four is the encore; 22 minutes-plus of Gregg Allman&apos;s ""Whipping Post,"" with Duane and Betts trading off leads around Gregg&apos;s organ, and both drummers taking off as well — Trucks sometimes on tympani.
If you&apos;ve been so unfortunate as to never have caught the Allman Brothers Band live, this recording is certainly the next best thing. Turn the volume up all the way and sit through the concert; by the time it&apos;s over you can almost imagine the Allman Band getting high and heading back to Macon (where, characteristically, they continue to live in unparanoid bliss) on their motorcycles.

Mick Jagger, Roger Daltrey and even Elton John — the latter a mere Doctor T. J. Eckleburg on Broadway to Stewart&apos;s alley-scuffling, eyeballing Gatsby — may be as exciting, but the Rolling Stones and the Who are formal institutions — visceral, more precise, a little threatening and definitely less friendly. Stewart, even in front of thousands, projects an ex-athlete&apos;s warmth, sets up towel-snapping camaraderie among the players and somehow manages to embody both the extroverted, one-of-the-boys hijinks of the macho carouser and the introverted, aw-she&apos;d-probably-never-notice-me-anyway vulnerability of the shyest kid on the block. Even as we envy his outgoing, big-winner&apos;s style, we revel in the knowledge he provides via self-mockery that he can lose as often and as badly as we do. That, I think, is a large part of his magic: He touches all of the places in the rock & roll heart.
Now Rod is back and Warners has got him! As befits his recent change of label (from Mercury to Warner Bros.) and of scene (from London to Los Angeles), Atlantic Crossing boasts both a new producer and supporting musical cast. With the venerable Tom Dowd behind the board, Stewart has freed himself of technical worries to concentrate solely on his singing. (My own theory is that Smiler was so disappointing because the singer for once overextended himself in the complexities of self-production.) The new backup musicians, mainly from Muscle Shoals and Memphis, provide the kind of crisp, authoritative, very spare basics that manage to suggest much of the pre-1975 Stewart as well as something completely different. Dowd has very good luck with the rock & roll numbers, maintaining control without sacrificing energy, at times utilizing horns and a soul chorus so seamlessly that one is almost unaware of their intrusion; unfortunately, he relies far too heavily on saccharine, overbearing string arrangements for many of the slower songs.
Atlantic Crossing is rather arbitrarily divided into Fast Side/Slow Side; thus too much of the album&apos;s best work comes first, only to be followed by a qualitative drop-off (an altogether disastrous misreading of the late Danny Whitten&apos;s ""I Don&apos;t Want to Talk about It,"" rather listless performances of Goldberg/Goffin&apos;s ""It&apos;s Not the Spotlight"" and Holland/Dozier/Holland&apos;s Isley Brothers hit, ""This Old Heart of Mine"") happily saved by a late-inning rally. Stewart starts things off with what is arguably his finest rocker to date, ""Three Time Loser,"" a randy, rowdy, genial, and genital rouser about — of all things! — venereal disease. While the song&apos;s wonderfully bawdy, ofttimes nearly undecipherable lyrics — does he really say, ""While I&apos;m jacking off reading Playboy on a hot afternoon""? — may give censors the hot flashes, everything else about ""Loser"" is so infectious it&apos;s hard not to imagine terrific radio emission. It&apos;s catchy.
""Alright for an Hour,"" coauthored by Stewart and Jesse Ed Davis, is an effective reggae number, its title the comic summary of an affair that ""did not last through the weekend."" ""I&apos;ll take my dog and my car/The best things I&apos;ve found so far,"" adds Rod before he exits, sailing into the slam-bang action of ""All in the Name of Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll,"" the picaresque saga of a carefree rock & roll band on the loose in America. The mood darkens a bit on Mentor Williams&apos;s ""Drift Away,"" a song which fits Stewart&apos;s persona perfectly, chronicling the mood of a romantic young man who feels he may have missed something essential in his knockabout adventures and now needs a place to escape from it all. For me, Dobie Gray&apos;s hit version of a few years ago sounds routine and unemotional when compared with Stewart&apos;s striving desperation; when Rod sings, ""Oh, give me the beat, boys, to soothe my soul/I want to get lost in your rock and roll/And drift away,"" he seems to mean it. Whoever decided to transform the song into lyrical reggae knew what he was doing. The first side closes with the jaunty ""Stone Cold Sober,"" a number which nearly matches ""Three Time Loser"" in outrageous ebullience as the singer, ""down in the alley again"" and very content to be there, pours forth hilariously the pros and cons of the spree.
Nothing much happens on the Slow Side until Stewart&apos;s own ""Still Love You,"" a song which evokes all of Rod&apos;s aforementioned vulnerability and shy-guy tenderness as well as ""Dirty Old Town,"" ""Country Comforts,"" ""Maggie May,"" ""Mandolin Wind,"" ""You Wear It Well"" and other cherished experiences from a shared past. The lyrics, melody and singing are beautiful here; the loss and longing, as palpable as ""two hearts gently pounding"" and the bittersweet memory of the initial electricity between two lovers who had it all once, may even have it again. The album closes with Gavin Sutherland&apos;s lovely and mythic ""Sailing,"" an appropriately symbolic anthem about a meaningful journey across sea and sky ""to be near you, to be free.""
If Atlantic Crossing isn&apos;t Rod Stewart&apos;s best record — and it isn&apos;t — it at least comes within hailing distance of earlier masterpieces.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202642.32/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322094932-20190322120932-00289.warc.gz
130,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/atom-heart-mother-111812/,"At one time, Pink Floyd was far-out, freaky even. Their work in the electronic capabilities of rock was more advanced than most people recognize. Their use of a third, rear, sound source anticipated quadraphonics. And their music, if it wasn&apos;t memorable, reached into the limits of their experimentation. Most other groups, when they thought in terms of electronics, thought only of painful feedback. Pink Floyd used sounds no one else thought of and could make them lyrical besides. Their last album, Ummagumma, while a bit drawn-out, had all their best elements.
Atom Heart Mother is a step headlong into the last century and a dissipation of their collective talents, which are considerable.
Side one is a suite, almost a symphony. It has a lot in it. They use orchestral elements and a choir. The best that can be said for it is that it&apos;s craftsman-like and that in spite of its many parts, it&apos;s an entity. But that&apos;s all.
It turns out to be an Impressionist orchestral sketch of (I think) a morning that includes some rock elements. As Impressionism, it&apos;s occasionally effective, but on a very imitative level. The beginning does sound sunrisey. And, there are sounds that draw pictures. But, as a whole it&apos;s awful schmaltzy and a little vapid.
Side two is generally worse. ""If"" is English folk at its deadly worst. It&apos;s soft and silly. Ditto ""Fat Old Sun.""
The only redeeming feature on this side is the last cut, ""Alan&apos;s Psychedelic Breakfast"" and then only partially so. The part is not the music, but the integrated Arising and Breakfast sounds.
I was listening through earphones, and so three-dimensional and realistic were the sounds that I took off the phones to see who was breaking in. I couldn&apos;t believe it to be part of the record. Once I got over that, though, it was the same insubstantial melange as the rest of the record.
If Pink Floyd is looking for some new dimensions, they haven&apos;t found them here.

131,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/august-206163/,"It has evidently been decided that Eric Clapton should shoot for hits, and, as a result, we get records as stilted and disappointing as August. Like 1985&apos;s Behind the Sun, August pairs Clapton with Phil Collins, who produced ten of the eleven tracks here, co-wrote one (""Hold On"") and plays drums throughout.
From a production standpoint, Collins has proved to be a most unfortunate choice for Clapton. In a misguided effort to give Clapton a contemporary sound, Collins has assembled arrangements that de-emphasize guitars and rely on keyboard and percussion effects (and occasionally horns) to achieve the continual sonic action and dense layering that current wisdom declares is necessary for successful radio play.
This strategy, however, simply serves to alienate Clapton from the sources – hard-hitting, blues-based rock & roll on the one hand, irresistibly melodic, emotionally tormented pop ballads on the other – that have not only generated his best music but also provided whatever hits he&apos;s had. Clapton&apos;s recent run of successful American club dates dramatized the degree to which he&apos;s capable of catching fire in an environment that&apos;s stripped down and sweaty – as opposed to the electronic control and studio cool of August.
While four tracks – ""Hung Up on Your Love,"" ""Take a Chance,"" ""Hold On"" and ""Miss You"" – are either so enervated or artificially juiced up as to be dismissible, it&apos;s Clapton&apos;s depressingly misconceived cover of Robert Cray&apos;s ""Bad Influence"" that truly highlights everything that&apos;s wrong with August. Doing a tune by a young-blood blues guitarist on the way up was a great idea. But instead of getting tough and paying Cray the compliment of taking him on head to head, Clapton and Collins translate Cray&apos;s charged tune into a poppy, affectless shuffle – embarrassing both themselves and the song.
Clapton generates some passion when he taps two of his favorite themes – triangular love affairs (""Behind the Mask,"" co-written by Michael Jackson, and the aching ballad ""Walk Away"") and the urge for redemption from ravaging personal problems (the hymnlike ballad ""Holy Mother,"" dedicated to the Band&apos;s late pianist, Richard Manuel, whose drug agonies paralleled Clapton&apos;s own). Just before wailing the solo on ""Holy Mother,"" which provides August&apos;s most feeling moment, Clapton sings of a point ""when my hands no longer play."" Perhaps the need to fend off such a fate – with a glance back to Richard Manuel&apos;s suicide – forced Clapton to reach deep inside and prove something. Unless Clapton urges himself to those depths more often, August could be the prelude to a fall that offers remembered heat as its only consolation.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203021.14/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323201804-20190323223804-00008.warc.gz

133,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/autoamerican-94515/,"Blondie&apos;s Autoamerican is a terrible album, but it&apos;s bad in such an arcane, high-toned way that listening to it is perversely fascinating. After Parallel Lines gave Chris Stein a carte blanche, it was only a matter of time until he started living out his fantasies of himself as a deep thinker. Since he could always be counted on to hedge his bets, however, he cannily managed to sustain the illusion that he still cared about rock & roll on Eat to the Beat. That illusion is surely dead now. And Stein is no longer depriving the world of his ""genius,"" because Autoamerican is his LP all the way. Indeed, it&apos;s such an anthology of intellectual onanism that it&apos;s almost the rock equivalent of a godawful Ken Russell movie.
A movie, in fact, is what the record transparently aspires to be. The conception, so far as I can figure it, treats American pop culture, or teenage subculture, in science-fiction terms as a kind of lost Atlantis: a legendary civilization made extinct by the disappearance of the surplus-goods society that fostered it. As an idea, this is one of those notions that feels like a cliché, even when you can&apos;t think of anybody else who&apos;s done it. It&apos;s too easy, though certainly feasible, depending on how it&apos;s worked out. Here, it hasn&apos;t been worked out at all. The theme is just a convenient touchstone to unify a lot of fairly ephemeral material that&apos;s patched together by a few repeated images and some graceless chunks of pretentious narration.
Autoamerican opens with an instrumental dirge called ""Europa"" (the Old World everybody had to leave, get it?) that&apos;s ludicrously portentous. Scored in the pastiche style of wretched soundtrack music, it&apos;s so promiscuously ethnic that, if it had characters, they&apos;d all have to be played, in fortissimo, by Anthony Quinn. The album closes with nothing less than that classic anthem to solipsism, ""Follow Me,"" from Camelot (a reference as thuddingly clever as ""Singin&apos; in the Rain"" at the end of Stanley Kubrick&apos;s A Clockwork Orange). Oddly enough, there isn&apos;t a single rock & roll song on the LP. Instead, we get MOR ballads wrapped in highbrow trimmings, funk played as cocktail music, an imitation-dub rap song and three (counting ""Follow Me"") pieces of fake-Tin Pan Alley, swing-era crooning.
Even when camp isn&apos;t the actual musical style, it&apos;s still omnipresent as an attitude. As Stein expounds upon and fills his hobbies (art films, sci-fi, kitschy artifacts) with hot air, he deflates rock & roll in order to demonstrate his superiority to it. He&apos;s so exclusively concerned with creating a modernist manifesto that he&apos;s dispensed with all the pop paraphernalia  —  e.g., hooks, rhythm, structure  —  that keeps an audience listening. His sense of pop culture itself is rarefied and coldly elitest: everything, in short, that rock & roll joyfully meant to clear away. Why would anyone make an album about pop that&apos;s totally devoid of humor, brashness, good times and physical energy? Who knows. (It&apos;s as if the jaded, enervated rich of Last Year in Marienbad had passed the time by translating old Ronettes singles into French.) And while he&apos;s expressing his contempt for pop, Chris Stein shamelessly embraces every snobbish cliché of current avant-garde thinking. The only things he seems to care about are the knowing little musical touches: the tinny, abstract-funk guitar lines borrowed from Talking. Heads, the tendentious panculturalism of it all.
You may be wondering what happened to Deborah Harry. Stein&apos;s largest mistake — or, alternately, the clearest sign of his arrogance — is his willingness to shortchange Blondie&apos;s biggest asset. It&apos;s not just that Harry sounds foolish reciting Autoamerican&apos;s bits of narration — the way they&apos;re written, so would Laurence Olivier. Her voice is all wrong for the tunes, too. She can&apos;t project nonchalance, wit or verbal sophistication and is denied any chance to utilize that peculiar metallic urgency characteristically found in her finest vocals. Without opportunities, she seems lost, as if she&apos;d wandered onto the wrong record. Even in the least stylized compositions, Harry sounds listless and dazed, barely there. And when she does try to show some sass and spunk — in the rap that (all too typically) gives ""Rapture"" its title  —  she&apos;s sunk by the leaden, schematic lyrics.
The rest of the group is almost as absent: the star parts all go to the brand-name sessionmen brought in for the LP, and at least half the songs are carried by horns (Caribbean and bullfight) or strings (MOR and pseudoclassical). Though Blondie&apos;s days as a sloppy but inspired trash-rock band are long gone (and more missed than ever), here the group doesn&apos;t even get to trot out the bombastic AOR chops that producer Mike Chapman gave them as a substitute on Parallel Lines and Eat to the Beat. Only ""T-Birds"" reaches for the old panache, and it&apos;s stopped cold by another bit of limp exhortation.
Organist Jimmy Destri is awarded a moment or two, and his and Laura Davis&apos; ballad, ""Angels on the Balcony,"" while somewhat slight, is the album&apos;s nicest and least abrasive number. Unfortunately, Destri is also responsible for one of Autoamerican&apos;s worst-conceived cuts: ""Walk like Me,"" a marching tune for a rebellion that you can&apos;t imagine the band actually believes in. Aside from its musical shortcomings  —  the melody is too flat for the song to be as stirring as it means to be — the idea that the way for teenagers to revolt against society is to follow the example set by blondie™ for murjani™ is truly laughable. Or not funny at all.
Still, you have to prefer Destri&apos;s attempts to make some connection with the outside world to Stein&apos;s bloodless manipulation of it. The best thing about ""Walk like Me"" is that, on Autoamerican, it sounds out of place: it&apos;s about something. For the rest, I wonder if the reason Chris Stein is so eager to proclaim the death of pop culture is so he can beat the hyenas to its bones.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202804.80/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323121241-20190323143241-00022.warc.gz

135,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/automatic-for-the-people-2-104206/,"R.E.M. has never made music more gorgeous than ""Nightswimming and ""Find the River,"" the ballads that close Automatic for the People and sum up its twilit, soulful intensity. A swirl of images natural and technological – midnight car rides and undertow, old photographs and headlong tides – the songs grapple, through a unifying metaphor of ""the recklessness of water,"" with the interior world of memory, loss and yearning. This is the members of R.E.M. delving deeper than ever; grown sadder and wiser, the Athens subversives reveal a darker vision that shimmers with new, complex beauty.
Despite its difficult concerns, most of Automatic is musically irresistible. Still present, if at a slower tempo, is the tunefulness that without compromising the band&apos;s highly personal message, made these Georgia misfits platinum sellers. Since ""The One I Love,"" its Top Forty hit from 1987, R.E.M. has conquered by means of artful videos, surer hooks and fatter production and by expanding thematically to embrace the doomsday politics of Document, the eco-utopianism of Green and the sweet rush of Out of Time. Brilliantly, the new album both questions and clinches that outreaching progress; having won the mainstream&apos;s ear, R.E.M. murmurs in voices of experience – from the heart, one on one.
In a minor key, ""Drive"" opens Automatic with Michael Stipe singing: ""Hey kids/Where are you?/Nobody tells you what to do,"" a chorus that wryly echoes David Essex&apos;s glam-rock anthem ""Rock On."" In its imagining of youth apocalypse, ""Drive"" upsets the pat assumption that the members of R.E.M. might still see themselves as generational spokesmen. The group then further trashes anyone&apos;s expectation of a nice pop record with ""Try Not to Breathe."" Alluding presumably to ""suicide doctor"" Jack Kevorkian (""I will try not to breathe/This decision is mine/I have lived a full life/These are the eyes I want you to remember""), the song ushers in a series of meditations on mortality that makes Automatic as haunted at times as Lou Reed&apos;s Magic and Loss. Relief comes in the form of whimsical instrumentation (such low-tech keyboards as piano, clavinet, accordion); political satire (""Ignoreland"") that suggests a revved-up Buffalo Springfield; and, on the catchy ""Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight,"" some of Stipe&apos;s niftier faux nursery rhymes (""A can of beans/Of black-eyed peas/Some Nescafe and ice/A candy bar/A falling star/Or a reading from Dr. Seuss""). Yet, without a single ""Shiny Happy People"" among its twelve songs, Automatic is assuredly an album edged in black.
Famous ghosts are tenderly remembered. The calypsolike ""Man on the Moon"" fantasizes holy-fool comedian Andy Kaufman in hip heaven (""Andy, are you goofing on Elvis?""), and a paean to Montgomery Clift, ""Monty Got a Raw Deal,"" exhorts Hollywood&apos;s wrecked Adonis to ""just let go."" Hard grief inspires ""Sweetness Follows"" (""Readying to bury your father and your mother""), yet compassion wins out: The sorrows that make us ""lost in our little lives,"" the song says, end in an inscrutable sweetness.
A homespun ditty, ""New Orleans Instrumental No. 1,"" and the woozy jazz of ""Star Me Kitten"" (featuring the weirdest love lyrics imaginable: ""I&apos;m your possession/So fuck me, kitten"") lighten Automatic somewhat, but the darker songs boast the stronger playing. Guitarist Peter Buck dazzles, not only with the finger picking that launched a thousand college bands but with feedback embellishments and sitarlike touches. As always, the rhythm section of bassist Mike Mills and drummer Bill Berry kicks; on about half the numbers, Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones crafts string arrangements that recall, in their Moorish sweep, his orchestral work for the Rolling Stones&apos; Their Satanic Majesties Request.
If ""Nightswimming"" and ""Find the River"" are R.E.M. at its most evocative, ""Everybody Hurts,"" the album&apos;s third masterpiece, finds the band gaining a startling emotional directness. Spare triplets on electric piano carry a melody as sturdy as a Roy Orbison lament, and Stipe&apos;s voice rises to a keening power. ""When you&apos;re sure you&apos;ve had too much of this life, well, hang on,"" he entreats, asserting that in the face of the tough truths Automatic for the People explores, hope is, more than ever, essential.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202781.33/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323080959-20190323102959-00286.warc.gz

Bryan Ferry stars as a remarkably expressive keyboard player and singer whose familiar mannerisms are subsumed in a rich, benevolent self-assurance. And reed man Andy Mackay shines in a series of cameos (his oboe meditation on Ferry&apos;s ""Tara"" is particularly lovely). Ten years after its debut, Roxy Music has mellowed: the occasional stark piano chords in ""While My Heart Is Still Beating,"" for example, recall the stately mood of ""A Song for Europe,"" but the sound is softer, dreamier and less determinedly dramatic now. Ferry&apos;s songwriting, however, has seldom seemed stronger.

Primitive Guitars bears no relation to his first solo LP, Diamond Head (one of the great British rock albums of the mid-Seventies), but it&apos;s considerably more engaging than his last outing, K-Scope. Here, Manzanera mans all the instruments (with the exception of one semiaudible contribution by bassist John Wetton) for a journey through his musical past. Some of the nine tracks, such as ""Caracas"" and ""Bogota,"" recall his South American childhood, and dense percussion predominates; the album&apos;s most striking aspect, however, is Manzanera&apos;s ability to wrench weird and utterly unguitarlike sounds from his main instrument — one track, called ""Impossible Guitar,"" lives up to its title in every way. There&apos;s no singing to speak of on Primitive Guitars, and those who aren&apos;t aficionados may find the album&apos;s cumulative effect somewhat samey.

137,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/avril-lavigne-head-above-water-review-793388/,"Avril Lavigne’s first record since the beginning of Barack Obama’s second term (in other words, seemingly centuries ago) finds everyone’s favorite arrested-development case emerging from a physically and emotionally debilitating time. She divorced husband number two, Nickelback’s Chad Kroeger, and was diagnosed with Lyme disease so severe that she was bed-ridden for a period. Alas, Head Above Water is neither a concept album about the life of a liquid-terrified tick nor one about Kroeger; Lavigne insists their breakup was amicable, and her ex is thanked in the credits for “beginning this album with me and seeing it through to the end.”

The record nonetheless comes with its own twist. Along with sophomore slumps, breakup albums remain one of pop’s most enduring traditions. But rarely has anyone sounded both as wrecked and rejuvenated over the course of the same record as on Head Above Water, which is an ongoing mood swing set to music. The Lavigne heard at the beginning of the record is almost an entirely different person by the end; the hard part is figuring out which part you like more.

For roughly the first third of the album, the heartbroken Lavigne is in sight. She’s fighting “the calm before the storm,” is “locked up in a cage called love” and “fell in love with the devil.” These songs are largely steeped in the sort of rain-lashed sludge rock heard on (surprise!) Nickelback records. They’re like Blood on the Processed Tracks.

About halfway through, she sounds as if she popped an antidepressant on the way to the studio. Like a teenager after her first major date, she's dreaming of “riding bikes at sunset by the ocean” and rhyming “pajamas” with “bananas” as he sings about her new lover finding her sexy. Aptly, the musical settings are far lighter: Suddenly, we’re in the land of carefully plucked acoustic guitars, finger-snapping pop and self-empowerment life lessons. ""Dumb Blonde,"" her kiss-off to those who are ""quick to condescend/Well, you think I'm empty, I'm not,"" lurches jarringly into rap-metal turf in its chorus, complete with a Nicki Minaj cameo.

Whatever mode she’s in, Lavigne's never sounded stronger or more vocally confident. Her half-yodel on “Love Me Insane” is a hook in itself. And both sides of Lavigne have their merits. She’s guardedly optimistic about a new love in “Souvenir” and appropriately giddy on “Bigger Wow,” which seems destined to be a summer jam.

But as on her second album, 2004's Under My Skin, she’s just more compelling and far less generic as a troubled adult. With its gloomy, feet-crunching-in snow beats, “Birdie” overcomes its cliché-a-verse lyric and, her voice spiraling up, breaks free of her burdens. She also sounds more convincing comparing herself to a Viking in the Kroeger-cowritten “Warrior” than going the power-balladeer route in ""Tell Me It's Over."" You hate to tell someone to stay distraught, but turmoil really suits her.

""Ain&apos;t No Telling"" is all Mitch Mitchell, who is by now definitely one of rock&apos;s most frantic drummers (from Moon to Baker). ""If 6 Was 9"" cracks foundations with banalized hippie lore (""wave my freak flag high""), while ""She&apos;s So Fine"" positively destroys walls.

Jimi Hendrix may be the Charlie Mingus of Rock, especially considering his fondness for reciting what might loosely be called poetry. But his songs too often are basically a bore, and the Experience also shares with Cream the problem of vocal ability. Fortunately both groups&apos; instrumental excellence generally saves the day, and Hendrix on Axis demonstrates conclusively that he is one of rock&apos;s greatest guitar players in his mastery and exploration of every conceivable gimmick.

Hendrix&apos;s delicate touch on the wah-wah pedal (a recent invention in 1968) glides and teases airily, drawing the ear into an album that wanted to take you higher, past gravity or limits of any kind. The late bassist Noel Redding kept the album on some sort of earthly axis, while drummer Mitch Mitchell was no less a renegade than Hendrix when it came to expressionistic frenzy; you can hear the two collide, commune and converse on such tracks as ""Spanish Castle Magic.""

This groundbreaking rap group&apos;s fifth album is a bitter disappointment because it&apos;s so obvious — or, as rappers Run and D.M.C. would now put it, so motherfuckin&apos; obvious. Gratuitous obscenities abound on the record, and they sure don&apos;t make Run-D.M.C.&apos;s new tales of street violence and urban injustice any more convincing. Brandishing guns and bantering with racist cops, Run and D.M.C. may well be telling it like it is in 1990. But on most of Back From Hell they sound like actors playing out roles rather than artists dramatizing their own lives.
DJ Jam Master Jay is at the top of his form, however. The music on Back From Hell is astounding: Jay constructs vivid minisoundtracks from the detritus of pop culture, laying samples on top of samples without overdoing it. He&apos;s obviously learned a lot from his production work with reggae rapper Shinehead and the Afros, a comic nostalgia act that appears on several tracks here. Unfortunately, that deep musical backing just throws more emphasis on the words, which can&apos;t carry the weight.
""What&apos;s It All About"" combines a quivery bass line with the vocal hook from ""Alfie,"" of all things, and makes you move. But Run just can&apos;t get started, so he waxes defensive: ""The Ku Klux Klan is fucked up.... Anybody who doesn&apos;t like what me and my crew is doing, fuck you.... Punk motherfuckers ... I&apos;ll break your fucking neck.""
That&apos;s saddening, since Run doesn&apos;t need to resort to empty threats and gestures; he&apos;s capable of outrhyming the competition. The rapport and humor of Run-D.M.C.&apos;s earlier work have been shelved in favor of Run&apos;s tough new stance; D.M.C.&apos;s earthy interjections come infrequently now and are sorely missed.

146,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/back-in-black-4-185012/,"Literally thousands of bands have talked about making an album like Back in Black — a singular blast of red-blooded, riff-driven rock & roll — but only AC/DC have succeeded so wildly. In February 1980, just after the Aussie fivesome had broken stateside with 1979&apos;s Highway to Hell, singer Bon Scott choked on his own vomit in the back of a car. The band initially returned to the studio as a form of therapy, but six weeks after Scott&apos;s death, it had found a replacement and soon after hopped a plane to the Bahamas to begin recording. If AC/DC were beset by sadness or uncertainty about how to proceed, they kept it to themselves. Indeed, Back in Black might be the leanest and meanest record of all time — balls-out arena rock that punks could love.
Now reissued with slightly crisper sound and a skimpy making-of DVD, Back in Black is the rare classic record that actually sounds timeless. Synergistically soused brothers Angus and Malcolm Young conceived the songs&apos; riffs first, defining each track with adrenalized blues blurts so archetypal that the sheet music ought to be chiseled on stone tablets. With future Def Leppard producer (and Mr. Shania Twain) Robert ""Mutt"" Lange emphasizing the hooks amid the racket, the results were body-rocking rather than overblown. Scott&apos;s replacement, Brian Johnson — who, appropriately enough, was toiling on an auto assembly line in England when he was called in for an audition — worked the grooves like a street brawler on jukebox shout-alongs such as ""You Shook Me All Night Long,"" ""Hells Bells"" and the defiant title cut.
Back in Black is so explosive that people forget that it was intended as a tribute to Scott. The same spirit that made the band tell the Grim Reaper to go fuck himself also made for some Spinal Tap-esque moments — particularly on the locker-room epic ""Givin&apos; the Dog a Bone."" The 20 million people who bought this album didn&apos;t care. Back in Black marked AC/DC&apos;s artistic peak, but how couldn&apos;t it? You could spend a lifetime trying to imitate music this perfectly simple.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203493.88/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324210143-20190324232143-00170.warc.gz
147,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/back-in-the-u-s-a-101058/,"Wop-bop-a-lu-bop-a-lop-bam-boom. Thud. ""Tutti Frutti,"" which opens the partly excellent MC5 album, is easily the worst cut on it, and in a way a clue to the rest of the record, which ends, stiffly enough, with ""Back in the USA."" The MC5 have roots; or their producer Jon Landau does, or somebody does. Over four minutes of totally pointless music is expended in ""proving"" that fact — and regardless of the possible coy significance of this one-time ""Killer Band"" singing ""Back in the USA"" as if it was some kind of confession, the performances of the old rock are dead, like someone reciting the alphabet instead of using the letters to make words.
There are some first-rate songs on the album, some good musical ideas, and the musicianship is competent throughout, often fun, sometimes exciting. ""Musicianship,"" here, is used as a concept — the idea of a ""solid, clean, tight and together"" sound is as self-conscious as the total freak out the first LP was. Chuck Berry simply oozes from the album.
A group of teenage consciousness numbers fill out the album — a re-working of themes from the Beach Boys, Chuck Berry, Gene Vincent, old South Philly street music, and the like. There&apos;s ""Shakin&apos; Street"" — the title predicts both the words and music; ""Call Me Animal""; ""High School"" — sis boom bah, rah rah rah, and so on. And then there are the cuts that make it, make it all the way, that show the real talent and special gifts of this band.
""Teenage Lust"" is just what is sounds like — urges all over the place, good hard rock (lacking any bass sound, as does the LP throughout, which is a drag), and those lines that Rob Tyner sings with such showmanship: ""I need a healthy outlet for/ For my teenage lust."" If you don&apos;t think that&apos;s funny, you didn&apos;t go to high school in the USA. Coming off the humor and the drive of the music, the song cuts deep, like ""I Get Around."" ""The American Ruse"" is probably the best thing the band has recorded; an attempt at phrase-making that just might come off:

I used to say the pledge of allegianceUntil they beat me bloody down at the stationThey haven&apos;t got a word outa meSince I got a billion years probationboom&apos;69 American terminal stasisThe air&apos;s so thick it&apos;s like breathin&apos; in molassesI&apos;m sick and tired of payin&apos; these duesAnd I&apos;m sick to my guts of the American RUSE!

That, in a few lines, is classic rock and roll songwriting. It&apos;s rarely done better. The chord changes that power the song seem to match up with the hurried tempo — the band can&apos;t wait to get to that last line, and the impact of every moment is heightened by the rush. Virtually the whole album is fast and edgy — but the problem of the music is in its competence. And the problem of its competence is in its so-carefully worked out intentions. Nothing was left to chance.
Nothing was left to chance, it seems, because this album, and the songs on it, constitute a very conscious attempt to do for teenage America what the rock and roll of the Fifties did instinctively and naturally — create a young community of spirit, affection, excitement, and self-consciousness. It&apos;s an attempt to define themes and problems and an offering of political, social, and emotional solutions. The clean, direct approach of the sound is the necessary vehicle for the straightforward consciousness of the message: ""Look, kid, you&apos;re not just some alienated sap bugged by the system, you&apos;re part of a gang that doesn&apos;t have rules yet, doesn&apos;t have leaders yet, but it&apos;s forming, kid, get on."" That&apos;s what Peter Townshend did with ""My Generation,"" what Eddie Cochran did with ""Come On Everybody.""
But the music, the sound, and in the end the care with which these themes have been shaped drags it down, save for two or three fine numbers that deserve to be played on every jukebox in the land. The street music of the MC5 has none of the animalism of the Good Rats (you might still find their brilliant LP — Kapp KS 3580) or uncontrollable drive of those first crucial sides by the Who. You can decide what to do, but if you feel like you know it all, like you&apos;ve seen it all, when it comes time to make the music, there&apos;s really nothing there but an idea.
Phil Spector once talked about the difference between ""records"" and ""ideas"" — ""The man who can make a disc that&apos;s a record and an idea will rule the world,"" he said in his typically moderate fashion. The MC5 album, for the most part, remains an idea, because in the end it sounds like a set-up. ""Teenage Lust"" and ""American Ruse"" and ""Human Being Lawnmower"" break through, and they belong on singles, and on the charts. All the way up the charts.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202530.49/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321172751-20190321194751-00489.warc.gz

150,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/back-to-the-egg-206167/,"As you may recall, the last time we came upon Paul McCartney, pilot of Wings, he&apos;d fashioned a thirteen-song offering called London Town, whose mildly tuneful title track was the epitome of the now-familiar, latter-day McCartney style of songwriting.
People pass by me on my imaginary streetOrdinary people it&apos;s impossible to meetHolding conversations that are always incompleteWell, I don&apos;t know....
Gliding along on the wheels of a catchy little melody, we were scarcely into his pale narrative when McCartney began laying out the limitations of the tale he was to tell. Still, the melody was infectious and the possibilities sufficiently promising, so we went along for the ride on the odd chance of meeting one of those ordinary folks he was crooning about. And, at length, we did — sort of.
Out of work again the actor entertains his wifeWith the same old stories of his ordinary lifeMaybe be exaggerates the trouble and the strifeWell, I don&apos;t know....
Thus unfolded another thoroughly unsatisfying Paul McCartney song on the archetypal Wings LP. London Town was an irritating mélange of lyric fragments, squandered melodies and clever but half-assed arrangements, the whole unrealized mess packaged with a slick, unctuous flair that would have reduced an idea like ""Eleanor Rigby"" to a two-line roundelay.
Since his solo debut in 1970 with the casual, albeit totally original McCartney, this ex-Beatle has been lending his truly prodigious talents as a singer, songwriter, musician and producer to some of the laziest records in the history of rock & roll. With the exception of Band on the Run and some relatively cohesive material on Venus and Mars, McCartney&apos;s work with Wings has proven to be as scattershot as it is puerile, each abortive rock snippet and silly love song feeding the mounting bewilderment about his direction (or utter lack of it) as an artist. Who, one felt compelled to ask, is in charge here? Back to the Egg provides the final, obvious answer: no one.
After ten Capitol albums with wife Linda, stalwart Denny Laine and various incarnations of Wings, McCartney jumped to Columbia last year in a multimillion-dollar deal that many thought would represent a new era for him musically. Despite the addition of Steve Holly on drums and Laurence Juber on guitar, Back to the Egg is just about the sorriest grab bag of dreck in recent memory.
Herewith, a sample of the words from the single, ""Getting Closer"": ""I&apos;m getting closer, my Salamander/When will we be there? Oh no, don&apos;t answer."" Mercifully, no lyric sheet is provided, but a throwaway scrap (what other kind of McCartney lyric is there?) from the above tune about a ""radio playing a song with a point"" sets an ironic tone for the entire LP. A veritable slide show of dead-end flights of fancy and yesterday&apos;s dross, Back to the Egg doesn&apos;t contain one cut that&apos;s the least bit fleshed out or brought to any logical conclusion. In place of well-framed songs, we get an irritating display of disjointed images and unfocused musical snapshots. Titles are abundant (fourteen in all), but the content is largely regurgitant. ""We&apos;re Open Tonight"" bears a strong resemblance to London Town&apos;s ""I&apos;m Carrying,"" while ""Winter Rose/Love Awake"" recalls ""Power Cut"" on Red Rose Speedway. ""After the Ball/Million Miles"" is the obligatory tip of the McCartney hat to English music-hall tradition, but it&apos;s vastly inferior to even such half-baked fluff as Venus and Mars&apos; ""You Gave Me the Answer.""
The instrumentation on Back to the Egg is so scrambled that any serious criticism would be ridiculous, except to note that the much-heralded ""Rockestra Theme"" (featuring the playing of Pete Townshend, Ronnie Lane, Kenney Jones, John Bonham, Gary Brooker, David Gilmour, John Paul Jones, et al.) is a flat affair cooked up around one hackneyed riff. Likewise, the runaway bass that made the disco single, ""Goodnight Tonight"" (absent from the album), a curiosity is in ample supply here, but not nearly as inventive or powerful. Instead, McCartney just retraces his tired old patterns.
""Arrow through Me"" illustrates why Paul McCartney&apos;s output is rarely covered anymore by other artists. At first pleasing to the ear, this love lament soon becomes so flaky that no other performer would dare stand naked with it. Indeed, the only track deserving of special mention is Denny Laine&apos;s ""Again and Again and Again,"" a somewhat engaging rock segment that could have been built into a comprehensible song. The rest of the record sounds like a rude mixture of subbasement tapes and prose torn at random from the Yellow Pages, interspersed for no discernible reason with — no kidding — some spoken excerpts from John Galsworthy&apos;s The Little Man and Ian Hay&apos;s The Sport of Kings.
In keeping with the fractured nature of Back to the Egg, I offer the reader a multiple-choice ending to this review, with the suggestion that he or she consider combining all of the following:
(A) This album is nothing more than a slipshod demo by an aimless band. If it had arrived unsolicited in the offices of Columbia, it would have been returned in the next mail with a terse ""No thank you.""
(B) I can think of few other prominent rock musicians who&apos;d have signed their names to this kind of drivel. McCartney&apos;s gross indulgence is matched only by his shameless indolence, and Back to the Egg represents the public disintegration of a consistently disappointing talent.
(C) Paul McCartney (how does this man sleep?) has been plagiarizing his own material for years now, and he&apos;s finally run out of recycled ideas. With a few key word changes, the lyrics that began this piece could end it on an appropriately grim autobiographical note.

151,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/back-to-the-world-191136/,"An engaging and paradoxic (at least in uptight Western terms), intensely masculine falsetto; a canny feeling of the confluence of handsome R&B melody with the realities and myths of black life in the Seventies; the &apos;fly and jivey street-wise sense of pop poesy and prophesy, plus the considerable arranging skills of Johnny Pate — all these conspired to make Curt Mayfield&apos;s soundtrack of the film Super Fly one of the major pop albums of 1972. And all of these abilities, minus the presence of arranger Pate and any discernible film (there&apos;s always the movie of the mind), are back again this year, neatly packaged in Back to the World. The interesting thing is that this new Mayfield album seems more like a film soundtrack than did Super Fly. The three excellent tracks on the first side average about six minutes each, while the inferior side two seems to consist more of filler and extended vehicles for large ensemble R&B arrangements.
 
Here&apos;s my plot: Our hero is a black sergeant just come ""Back to the World"" (GI lingo for any place but Vietnam and also the title out of this record). In Nam he was both a high-living TooDoo coke dealer and a POW. Back on the South Side he goes to see his mom and checks out the folks getting cut on the street, and ma tells him that things ain&apos;t changed — ""In these city streets, everywhere you got to be careful/Where you move your feet and how you part your hair."" He goes out and tries to get some kind of honest gig but Nixon conspires to have the New York banks raise the prime lending rate so black vets can&apos;t start businesses. In desperation he manages to obtain the official Super Fly cocaine franchise for Illinois. Generally pissed, he also forms a band from disaffected fellow vets and sings the fine title tune, as well as ""Future Shock"" (a percussive first cousin of ""Pusherman"" and ""Super Fly""), about how done-in the present is — ""The price of meat/Higher than dope on the street....""
Anyway his enterprise grows and he&apos;s soon cutting into the huge dope profits of the Chicago police, who of course try to off him (the pimp-mobile chase scene) but succeed only in blinding him. Now really righteously pissed, Curt and the band sing ""Right on for the Darkness,"" eight solid minutes of bitterness, anger and self-confidence, a truely effective number about ""a messy world of tears."" A famous promo man for a Major Label hears the tune while he&apos;s looking to score, signs the band, releases ""Right on for the Darkness"" as a single, and it sells four million copies in six weeks. The original number&apos;s excessive orchestral coda (arrangements this time by Richard Tufo) is of course edited out of the single.
On side two our hero meets a fine woman and takes the band on the road. In a Holiday Inn he rocks out on a tough and hectic number called ""If I Were a Child Again,"" a nostalgic bit of heat about the old days. In the same motel room he eats some organic mescaline and his woman; the combination of magic alkaloids and vaginal secretions direct from the source restores his sight, and he sings ""Keep On Trippin&apos;"" and the band plays ""Can&apos;t Say Nothin&apos;,"" an extended arrangement for big R&B outfit and goofy words. Great mescaline!
What&apos;s remarkable about Mayfield and this album seems to be nothing less than the cyclical emotions that make up the beats on the strong pulse of black life. Curtis covers a lot of sensory ground — bitterness, ambivalent feelings, ecstasy — and he sings as both participant and observer, always managing to dip his persona in edgy, get-back funk. And here&apos;s my bitch, Curtis: The musicians who played on this cycle of songs aren&apos;t listed — the contribution they make to an anthem of pure empathy and style like ""Back to the World"" shouldn&apos;t go unnoticed.

152,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/bad-251305/,"Michael Jackson is a man. Agreed, he is a young man, emotional age about thirteen, with a young man&apos;s interest in cars, girls, scary movies and gossip. But adolescent stardom, Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses wackiness and unadulterated genius have kept this faux-porcelain elephant man more childlike than any oxygen-tank sleeping device ever could.
Bad is the work of a gifted singer-songwriter with his own skewed aesthetic agenda and the technical prowess to pursue it. Let the paid Encinologists comb through the small print for clues to understanding Jackson&apos;s complicated world. Does ""God, I need you"" in the carnal duet ""I Just Can&apos;t Stop Loving You"" constitute blasphemy in the wake of his departure from the Witnesses? Is the liner note to ""Mother & Joseph Jackson"" a tea leaf of familial discord or a casual term of address? Does anyone really care?
Nor should it matter to anyone but the beneficiaries of its anticipated sales whether Bad moves 4 or 12 or 50 million units. Comparisons with Thriller are unimportant, except this one: even without a milestone recording like ""Billie Jean,"" Bad is a better record. The filler — ""Speed Demon,"" ""Dirty Diana,"" arguably ""Liberian Girl"" — is Michael&apos;s filler, which makes it richer, sexier, better than Thriller&apos;s forgettables: ""Baby Be Mine,"" ""P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing),"" ""Lady in My Life.""
Leaving the muddy banks of conjecture — as to sales, as to facial surgery, as to religion, as to, Is he getting it, and if so, from whom or what? — we can soar into the heart of a nifty piece of work. Bad offers two songs, its title cut and ""Man in the Mirror,"" that stand among the half dozen best things Jackson has done. A third, ""The Way You Make Me Feel,"" is nearly as good. The only mediocrity is ""Just Good Friends"" (one of two songs not written by M.J.), a Stevie Wonder pairing that starts well but devolves into a chin-bobbing cheerfulness that is unforced but also, sadly, unearned.
Churls may bemoan ""I Just Can&apos;t Stop Loving You,"" Jackson&apos;s duet with the often indistinguishable Siedah Garrett, as a second unworthy entry. Without descending to musical McCarthyism and questioning the honor of anyone who can fault a record with both finger snaps and timpani, it need only be asked, Who, having heard the song at least twice, can fail to remember that chorus?
Bad is not only product but also a cohesive anthology of its maker&apos;s perceptions. Where ""Lady in My Life"" was as believable as Abba&apos;s phonetic re-recording of its hits in Spanish, ""I Just Can&apos;t Stop Loving You"" quivers with the kind of desire that makes men walk bent at the waist. ""Liberian Girl"" glistens with gratitude for the existence of a loved one.
Once again, Jackson has written songs as dreams, and once again he has the unselfconsciousness to present them without interpretation. ""Speed Demon,"" the car song, is a fun little power tale, in which Jackson&apos;s superego gives his id a ticket; ""Smooth Criminal"" may be the result of retiring too soon after a Brian de Palma picture. It&apos;s gory, but almost in the popcorn-chomping manner of ""Thriller."" As in his best songs, Jackson&apos;s free-form language keeps us aware that we are on the edge of several realities: the film, the dream it inspires, the waking world it illuminates.
If these songs — even ""Smooth Criminal,"" with its incessant ""Annie, are you okay?"" — seem less threatening than previous dream songs, like ""Heartbreak Hotel"" and ""Wanna Be Startin&apos; Somethin&apos;,"" it&apos;s because Jackson&apos;s perspective has changed. He is no longer the victim, the vegetable they want to eat up, but a concerned observer or a participant with power. For example, ""Dirty Diana,"" the wisp of a song about a sexual predator, does not aim for the darkness of ""Billie Jean""; instead, Jackson sounds equally intrigued by and apprehensive of a sexual challenge, but he feels free to accept or resist it. As on many of the sketchier songs, producer Quincy Jones marshals his most flamboyant strokes — crowd noise, Steve Stevens guitar and John Barnes string arrangement — to make a substantial recording out of an insubstantial melody.
""Bad"" needs no defense. Jackson revives the ""Hit the Road, Jack"" progression and proves (with a lyric beginning with ""Your butt is mine"" and ending with the answered question ""Who&apos;s bad?"") that he can outfunk anybody any time. When Jackson declares that ""the whole world has to answer right now,"" he is not boasting but making a statement of fact regarding his extraordinary stardom. If anything, he is scorning the self-coronation of lesser funk royals and inviting his fickle public to spurn him if it dare. Not since the ""Is it good, ya?"" of Godfather Brown has a more rhetorical question been posed in funk.
Michael Jackson deserves the rewards due to those who tell their truth, who admit complexity when simplifications are at hand and who can funk in the valley of the gods. On ""Man in the Mirror,"" a song he did not write, Jackson goes a step further and offers a straightforward homily of personal commitment: ""I&apos;m starting with the man in the mirror/I&apos;m asking him to change his ways/And no message could have been clearer/If you wanna make the world a better place/Take a look at yourself and then make a change.""
Snipers have dismissed this as a solipsistic, Eighties view of political engagement, but no one since Dylan has written an anthem of community action that has moved so many as Michael&apos;s (and Lionel&apos;s) ""We Are the World."" And no such grandiose plans can succeed without the first, private steps that Jackson describes here.
The best way to view Bad is not as the sequel to Thriller. Rather, imagine an album made up of ""Style of Life,"" ""Blues Away,"" ""Bless His Soul,"" ""Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground),"" ""That&apos;s What You Get (for Being Polite),"" ""Heartbreak Hotel"" and ""Can You Feel It,"" from the Jacksons&apos; LPs, and ""Don&apos;t Stop &apos;Til You Get Enough,"" ""Working Day and Night,"" ""Billie Jean,"" ""Beat It"" and ""Wanna Be Startin&apos; Somethin&apos;,"" from Michael&apos;s solo records. View that phenomenal album&apos;s worth of music as the opening statement of Michael Jackson the autonomous artist. View Bad as its first fascinating successor.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202640.37/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322074800-20190322100800-00180.warc.gz

154,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/bad-bunny-x100pre-album-review-772379/,"Has there ever been an artist who needed to release an album less than Bad Bunny? For three years now, this Puerto Rican star, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, has been gushing hit singles like a broken fire hydrant. His voice, low and droning, is inimitable and absurdly adaptable, equally at home in stadium-ready trap (""Diles""), weapons-grade reggaeton (""Te Bote""), sunny cumbia (""Mayores""), seduce-your-girl R&B (""Si Tu Novio Te Deja Sola""), club-pop missiles (""Mia""), grungy rock (""Sensualidad"" at the Latin Grammys), salsa (""Mala Y Peligrosa""), dejected piano balladry (""Amorfada"") and choral tropical house, a fusion he might have invented (""Estamos Bien""). Many artists master at most one style; at age 24, Bad Bunny already commands multitudes. 

So his debut, X100PRE, at first seems like an odd concession to the old-school from an artist who made old-school look thoroughly obsolete — if singles are enough to get you into the studio with Drake, why bother with a full-length? But X100PRE is everything you could possibly want from a debut album: Plenty of the stuff that initially brought Bad Bunny fame along with some impressively executed forays into new styles — no small feat, considering how many genres he has already infiltrated. 

X100PRE seesaws between two modes: Near-invincible levels of swagger and utter despondence. ""I do not go to stores, because I own the mall/ I'm Cristiano after putting in a goal/ I have French speaking in Spanish,"" Bad Bunny sings in ""Otra Noche en Miami,"" a propulsive, brittle Eighties pop record that could play equally well after Drake's ""Hold On, We're Going Home"" or Taylor Swift's ""Style."" But much of that bravado is missing in ""Tenemos Que Hablar,"" a totally unexpected pop-punk cut. ""I hate your messages, when you say we have to talk,"" Bad Bunny sings. 

This dynamic plays out again and again. ""I break the rules and I repair them,"" Bad Bunny brags in ""Caro,"" the type of airy, triumphant trap record that sounds best at ear-splitting volume. Then in the gorgeously brooding ""RLNDT,"" he is lost at sea, a true chico dark in bad need of a pep talk: ""Tears leave no trace, so I do not leave a trace."" 

Bad Bunny worked primarily with the reggaeton hitmaker Tainy — the same beat-genius behind ""Estamos Bien"" — on X100PRE, and the results are frequently breathtaking. ""Ni Bien Na Mal"" is rugged rap until the end, when it resolves with a handsome string-section and a wind-chime sound that would lull your baby to sleep. Those unexpected guitars from ""Tenemos Que Hablar"" return more subtly in the second half of ""Como Antes,"" suggesting Bad Bunny might have planted the seeds of a whole new genre, Latin-trap-punk-pop. 

A different sort of guitar riff, acoustic and prickly, boosts ""La Romana,"" which initially sounds like a trap cousin to J Balvin's ""Reggaeton"" (another Tainy production). But then the dynamite Dominican rapper El Alfa shows up for a breathless, full-tilt dembow cut. When he collaborated with Cardi B recently on ""Mi Miami,"" the two were criticized for eschewing the pummeling dembow that made El Alfa a star; he did not make the same mistake when in the studio with Bad Bunny.

The other big names on X100PRE aside from El Alfa — and Drake, since the October single ""Mia"" reappears as the last track — are Diplo and Ricky Martin, who both carry themselves admirably. Diplo put together the beat for ""200 MPH,"" a pitch-perfect trap hit as potent as anything coming out of Atlanta; this should be played on both RapCaviar and major hip-hop radio stations, though both treat Spanish-language hip-hop as window-dressing. (If ""I Like It"" fits your rotation, there are plenty of other Latin trap songs that should also make the cut.) ""Caro"" works in a similar mode to ""200 MPH,"" until Martin shows up to echo Bad Bunny during a lovely interlude — a pretty ballad strong enough to be an entire song on its own.

It's a healthy time for Latin pop. The great artists, a group that includes J Balvin, Rosalía and Ozuna, are putting out massive global hits while also crafting meticulous, considered, genre-hopping albums; these singers are versatile in a way that makes many Anglo artists seem monochromatic, and they make that versatility look not just stylish, but essential to vital artistry. Bad Bunny conquered the singles game with ease. On X100PRE, he cements his place among the elite in Latin pop — and in pop music writ large.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202723.74/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323040640-20190323062640-00288.warc.gz

Which is not to imply that it is any better than those Experience albums. The context of the album is vital — Band of Gypsys was one of Hendrix&apos; 1969 amalgamations consisting of Buddy Miles on drums and Billy Cox on bass, among others. They hadn&apos;t been together very long when this session was recorded live at the Fillmore East, New Year&apos;s Eve 1969/70, and the music shows it.
Both sides are basically extended jams with lots of powerful, together guitar by Hendrix, able bass by Cox, at times overbearing drums by Miles and rather lame, buried vocals by both Hendrix and Miles. The group sound is surprisingly similar to Hendrix&apos; old ""Foxy Lady"" and ""Purple Haze"" days, with the significant difference that here Hendrix really gets into his guitar playing. No more the flashy, crotch-oriented gimmickry and extended wah-wahs — here he just stands still and shows us how adept he is with the ax. The support from Cox is always inventive, but Miles&apos; drumming is definitely disturbing and exceedingly pedestrian at times. Hendrix overcomes on pure tension alone, as both ""Message To Love"" and ""Who Knows"" aptly demonstrate.
The problem is the vocals — all the tunes are new ones and with Hendrix&apos; weird poetic sensibility (akin to LeRoi Jones in effect at times: catch the poem on the inside cover), it would have been a large improvement had we been presented with a little less drumming and a lot more vocal. The excitement and hypnotic compression so apparent in the music would have been pressed home even wore forcefully behind Hendrix&apos; drawling, heavily inflected voice, because Hendrix is not just a run-of-the mill R&B singer — his voice is just as much an instrument as his guitar. But, it&apos;s all just potential this time out, with the one exception of the twelve-minute ""Machine Gun,"" dedicated to ""all the soldiers that are fighting in Chicago, Milwaukee and New York and . . . oh, yes . . . all the soldiers fighting in Viet Nam."" Here the Hendrix vocal is in the forefront and perfectly matched to his most desperate, driving guitar solo ever. You can hear the sirens wailing and the entire mood, even down to Miles&apos; drumming, is one of confrontation and freneticism mixed in equal parts.

Why, after all this time, a sequel? Perhaps because the theatrical carnage inflicted by the 1977 original continues to be much appreciated — to the tune of a brisk 15,000 units per week. Or perhaps, after dueling lawsuits, he has made his peace with his former partner, writer-producer Jim Steinman. Whatever the reason, Loaf hasn&apos;t made a record since Bad Attitude, in 1985 — which died a quick death — and he has been splitting his time between acting and perfecting his curveball on the softball fields of New York City&apos;s Central Park.
Accompanied by an impressive cast from the original album (keyboardist Roy Bittan and drummer Kenny Aronoff, with vocal support by Ellen Foley, Kasim Sultan and Todd Rundgren), Bat II is 75 minutes of the same harmless, low-octane operatic drivel.

Common may be able to do both, finally, with his sixth and best disc, Be. The not-so-secret weapon here is Kanye West, who produced nine of the tracks and appears on four. West is the producer Common has been waiting for all of his career: He makes Common both catchier and edgier at the same time. The straight-ahead hip-hop songs — ""The Corner,"" ""The Food"" — are the hardest-rocking tracks of Common&apos;s career. On the ballad ""Faithful,"" the rapper pledges fidelity to both his lady and his maker without descending into corn, as singers John Legend and Bilal reach for gospel heights. ""They Say"" is the triumphant battle track: As Legend sings the satiny hook, Common and Kanye celebrate a hip-hop world that has finally come to them.

Be As You Are is also inspired by the islands, but this time Chesney has recorded an entire album of breezy change-of-pace ballads. Over little more than piano and acoustic guitar, Chesney lays his supple, hunky tenor into sun-soaked reflections about ""French Kissin&apos; Life"" and the joys of key lime pie, pausing for some perfunctory character sketches involving New Englanders who just want to get away from it all.

166,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/be-here-now-186514/,"If the art of rock — and of making great rock records — is essentially a matter of putting the right notes in the right order over a good beat at top volume, then ""D&apos;You Know What I Mean?,"" Oasis opening broadside on Be Here Now, is seven minutes of simple, focused genius. The important stuff is all here: the squealing feedback, chain-saw distortion and coughing wah-wah of a huge, brutish guitar orchestra; a slow, tough rhythm, stoked for extra measure by a drum sample from N.W.A&apos;s Straight Outta Compton; a singer who ratchets up the cocksure posturing of the lyrics (""All my people right here, right now/They know what I mean"") with a sour howl and arrogant relish; a big finish in which everything in the mix — the guitars, the braying vocals, the fat whack of the rhythm section — is sucked into the jet-engine roar of the distended chorus.
There are references to God in the lyrics, and the song appears to be about a crisis of faith. But you wouldn&apos;t know it from the attitude pouring through the amps. ""D&apos;You Know What I Mean?"" — and for that matter the rest of Be Here Now— is music built for impact, not explanation. You want epic narrative, grand metaphor and explicit spiritual testimony? Get a book of poetry — or a Van Morrison record.
Oasis are not, and have never been, a complex listening experience; in fact, they&apos;ve basically made the same album thrice. Like 1994&apos;s Definitely Maybe and 1995&apos;s (What&apos;s the Story) Morning Glory?, Be Here Now is &apos;60s and &apos;70s rock classcism writ large and loud, all broad strokes and bullish enthusiasm. As the band&apos;s songwriter, co-producer and (for all intents and purposes) iron ruler, guitarist Noel Gallagher doesn&apos;t spend any sweat on highbrow drama or intellectual pretense. He fires up sing-along hooks with industrial-strength glam-rock licks; he drapes his words and music in the reflected splendor of the Beatles at every available turn, mostly through song — and album-title references, and spit-shines the results with a kind of roughneck sentimentality, heard to most obvious effect in the Sunday-night-pub-chorale endings of ""Magic Pie"" and ""All Around the World.""
It&apos;s a formula that can go either way: brilliant, steel-plated consistency or vacuous, shopworn predictability. Gallagher and Oasis pull it off, in great part, because they do not concede any possibility of fucking up. A lot of Gallagher&apos;s lyrics are catch-phrase cocktails of youthful optimism and hard-boy temperament: ""Comin&apos; in out of nowhere/Singing rhapsody"" (""Fade In-Out""); ""Into my big mouth/You could fly a plane"" (""My Big Mouth""). But the most contagious thing about buzz bombs like ""My Big Mouth,"" ""I Hope, I Think, I Know"" and ""It&apos;s Gettin&apos; Better (Man!!)"" is the sheer physical confidence of the music, particularly in the tandem rock ribbed guitars of Gallagher and Bone-head (a k a Paul Arthurs), and the way singer Liam Gallagher literally assaults the songs written for him by his older brother.
Much has been made of the John Lennon factor in Liam&apos;s nasally, brattish intonation. In fact, his voice is a flat, thin thing. What&apos;s remarkable about it is its emphatic, almost fighting quality; Liam enunciates Noel&apos;s lyrics with snappish irritation and grinds the vowels in words like fade and away into high-tension whines. By the time Liam gets done with the chorus in Noel&apos;s Big Melodrama ballad, ""Stand by Me"" — ""Stand by me-e-e/Nobody kno-woa-ahs/The way it&apos;s gon-nah-h be-e-e"" — it sounds full of portent, if not bona fide linear meaning.
The payoff in Noel&apos;s writing is always in the choruses; all riffs, hooks and bridges lead there. So Noel feeds Liam words and phrases that, above all, sound good. While it&apos;s hard to excuse jury-rigged verse like ""A cold and frosty morning/There&apos;s not a lot to say/About the things caught in my mind"" (""Don&apos;t Go Away""), sometimes in pop music, melody, muscle and mouthing off can be their own substantial reward.
But only for so long. Oasis can&apos;t rely on this Abbey Road-meets-Never Mind the Bollocks routine forever. There are already signs of strain on Be Here Now. ""Stand by Me"" is a little too close to Morning Glory&apos;s ""Don&apos;t Look Back in Anger"" for coincidence, and there is an overreliance on swollen ""Hey Jude""-style finales in the ballads.
Which brings up the Beatles issue. Noel Gallagher&apos;s love of the group is genuine. ""Sing a song for me/One from Let It Be,"" he writes in ""Be Here Now"" — a title cribbed from Lennon&apos;s infamous quip to an interviewer who asked him about the deep, underlying philosophy of rock & roll. But Noel is starting to overplay his hand; dropping a line like ""The fool on the hill and I feel fine"" in the middle of ""D&apos;You Know What I Mean?"" smacks of laziness more than fannish ardor.
Maybe if Oasis weren&apos;t so ultra-mega-huge in England and smiled more onstage when they came here, it would be easier to accept them for what they are: a great pop band with a long memory. What will they, or their records, mean in 20 years&apos; time? Who cares? Be here now.

The so-called ""Esher demos"" — 27 songs taped on Harrison's four-track machine — were at once stark and full, solo acoustic blueprints already outfitted with signature flourishes: double-tracked vocals; John Lennon's raindrop-arpeggio guitar in ""Dear Prudence""; the future guitar solo in ""Back in the U.S.S.R.,"" hummed by Paul McCartney.

There was evidence too of tension and estrangement: Lennon's jagged rhythms and aggressive cynicism (""Revolution,"" ""Yer Blues""); McCartney's determined optimism (""Blackbird"") and almost mutinous cheer (""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da""). In his Appalachian-ballad draft of ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" Harrison pointedly censured his bandmates, singing ""The problems you sow are the troubles you're reaping."" He dropped the line in the final version. His dismay in the song remained.

 At 30 tracks on two LPs and dubbed ""The White Album"" for its blank-canvas sleeve, it was the group's longest, most eclectic and emotionally blunt record – an admission of frayed nerves and strained bonds in the zigzag of garage-roots rock, delicate balladry, proto-metal fury, country ham and radical experiment. The ""Super Deluxe"" edition of The Beatles has even more. In addition to the demos and a new remix of the album overseen by Giles Martin, son of the late producer George Martin, there are 50 tracks of the work in progress – outtakes and sketches; roads not taken and songs left behind – across the summer and fall of 1968.

But the Esher tapes are a profound record in themselves. There are rough lyrics and missing parts; Lennon's ""Glass Onion"" is just one, repeated verse. But this is an unprecedented view of the Beatles at the ground zero of songwriting as well as the trials and conflict that charged that bounty: the death of manager Brian Epstein in 1967; the chaotic launch of Apple Corps.; the disappointment of the Beatles' recent trip to India. Lennon takes his swipe at the Maharishi (""Sexy Sadie""); he is also exhausted to the point of begging (""I'm So Tired""). McCartney finds relief in corn (""Honey Pie""). Harrison is coming up strong but frustrated. His Esher songs ""Circles"" and ""Not Guilty"" have to wait for solo albums.

The outtakes vary in impact. A 12-minute ""Helter Skelter"" is not the noise fest I hoped but a solid groove, McCartney leading a blues-jam Beatles. The minute differences in Lennon's two takes of longing for his mother, ""Julia,"" are telling; his vocal falls more naturally over the guitar in the second pass. An alternate down-home ""Good Night"" is a marvelous shock, Ringo Starr's homely vocal gilded with earthy harmonies closer to the Band, moving in Byrds-like formation. And do not fear for the original album: Giles' remix adds depth and detail without betraying the '68 balance as in the new, striking contrast between the doldrums and tumult in Harrison's ""Long, Long, Long.""

The Beatles is now seen as the album on which they started to break up. But it was wisely titled: a self portrait of the band at odds but pulling together behind each writer, playing as they always did: in service to the song.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202003.56/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319163636-20190319185636-00354.warc.gz

And wounded anger is shot through her new album, Bedtime Stories, as she works out survival strategies. While always a feminist more by example than by word or deed, Madonna seems genuinely shocked at the hypocritical prudishness of her former fans, leading one to expect a set of biting screeds. But instead of reveling in raised consciousness, Bedtime Stories demonstrates a desire to get unconscious. Madonna still wants to go to bed, but this time it&apos;s to pull the covers over her head.
Still, in so doing, Madonna has come up with some awfully compelling sounds. In her retreat from sex to romance, she has enlisted four top R&B producers: Atlanta whiz kid Dallas Austin, Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds, Dave ""Jam"" Hall and Britisher Nellee Hooper (Soul II Soul), who add lush soul and creamy balladry. With this awesome collection of talent, the record verily shimmers. Bass-heavy grooves push it along when more conventional sentiments threaten to bog it down. Both aspects put it on chart-smart terrain.
A number of songs — ""Survival,"" ""Secret,"" ""I&apos;d Rather Be Your Lover"" (to which Me&apos;Shell NdegéOcello brings a bumping bass line and a jazzy rap) — are infectiously funky. And Madonna does a drive-by on her critics, complete with a keening synth line straight outta Dre, on ""Human Nature"": ""Did I say something wrong?/Oops, I didn&apos;t know I couldn&apos;t talk about sex (I musta been crazy).""
But you don&apos;t need her to tell you that she&apos;s ""drawn to sadness"" or that ""loneliness has never been a stranger,"" as she sings on the sorrowful ""Love Tried to Welcome Me."" The downbeat restraint in her vocals says it, from the tremulously tender ""Inside of Me"" to the sob in ""Happiness lies in your own hand/It took me much too long to understand"" from ""Secret.""
The record ultimately moves from grief to oblivion with the seductive techno pull of ""Sanctuary."" The pulsating drone of the title track (co-written by Björk and Hooper), with its murmured refrain of ""Let&apos;s get unconscious, honey,"" renounces language for numbness.
Twirled in a gauze of (unrequited) love songs, Bedtime Stories says, ""Fuck off, I&apos;m not done yet."" You have to listen hard to hear that, though. Madonna&apos;s message is still ""Express yourself, don&apos;t repress yourself.""

171,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/bee-thousand-186647/,"Late in Bee Thousand, Guided by Voices singer/songwriter Robert Pollard provides a skeleton key to his remarkable music. ""I am a pharmacist, prescriptions I will fill you,"" he sings, ""potions, pills and medicines to ease your painful lives."" It&apos;s no empty boast — the stately little hymn ""I Am a Scientist"" and the 19 other sublime songs on this album possess just such restorative powers.
GBV&apos;s seven previous albums (released in limited editions on minuscule indies) were brilliant, but Bee Thousand is a tour de force by a good old-fashioned American basement genius. A rotating group of thirtysomethings based in Dayton, Ohio, Guided by Voices mine familiar territory: classic English pop rockers like the Who, the Kinks and the Beatles, albeit filtered through latter-day Beatlemaniacs like Cheap Trick and Robyn Hitchcock, as well as lo-fi avatars like Daniel Johnston and Pavement.
The group is clearly guided by those voices, but the band name also goes a long way toward identifying the surely ethereal source of their inspiration as well as underscoring the way Pollard&apos;s vocals drive the moving, indelible melodies. An irresistible English folk drone weaves throughout the record, as in the jingle-jangle mournfulness of ""Queen of Cans and Jars,"" singer and guitarist Tobin Sprout&apos;s exquisite ""Ester&apos;s Day"" (co-written with Pollard) and the uncannily long-lined melody of ""Smothered in Hugs.""
Recorded on a four-track machine, Bee Thousand sounds like a favorite bootleg or a beloved old LP whose worn grooves now reveal only a blurry jumble. Amp hum, sniffling musicians and creaking chairs all inhabit the mix, but the homespun production only underlines the strength of the songs — lo-fi or not, there&apos;s no denying an astonishing rush of guitar-pop glory like ""Tractor Rape Chain.""
As with Big Star, the beauty of GBV&apos;s music cocoons — and so triumphs over — its own root sadness, like an oyster building a pearl around an irritating grain of sand. In the jubilant climax of ""Echos Myron,"" Pollard&apos;s voice radiates a downright heroic melancholy as he sings, ""And we&apos;re finally here/And, shit, yeah, it&apos;s cool,"" and then can&apos;t help but add ""or something like that.""
Even if the lyrics sometimes read like mad-libs (""I met a nondairy creamer explicitly laid out like a fruitcake,"" Pollard sings on ""Hot Freaks""), they always play to Pollard&apos;s strong point, which is precisely where rock itself excels — combining music and words to produce a distinctly third impression that&apos;s complex, unnameable and yet startlingly vivid. But the real miracle of Bee Thousand is that it not only celebrates the power of rock music, it also embodies it. ""I am a lost soul/I shoot myself with rock & roll,"" Pollard sings on ""I Am a Scientist,"" ""but nothing else can set me free.""",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204969.39/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326095131-20190326121131-00330.warc.gz

You get a little sick of hearing the crowd between songs (we get it, there&apos;s an audience!), but in many ways this is the album the Crowes have been meaning to record for years.

174,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/before-these-crowded-streets-109332/,"With the notable exception of its 1994 breakout single, ""What Would You Say,"" Dave Matthews Band has always been more about sound than songs. This continues to be true on the group&apos;s propulsive new album, Before These Crowded Streets. Teaming up again with producer Steve Lillywhite, DMB is more successful on this outing than ever before in translating the roiling energy of its stage show to the studio. The band also pushes in adventurous new directions, incorporating bright new hues into its highly distinctive, instantly recognizable sonic palette.
DMB&apos;s lethal secret weapon has always been its extraordinary — and criminally underpraised — rhythm section. If you want to organize a band with a front line of violin, saxophone, and acoustic and electric guitars, and your music relies on tricky time signatures, complex arrangements and fevered ensemble playing that bolts into reckless improvisational flights, your drummer and bass player better swing like Joe DiMaggio. Stefan Lessard and Carter Beauford more than fill the bill — they anchor this unwieldy outfit without ever weighing it down. And when it&apos;s time to fly, they give the band wings.
Building on that foundation, Matthews makes some bold moves on Streets. With violinist Boyd Tinsley and saxophonist LeRoi Moore leading the way, ""The Last Stop"" shimmers with keening Middle Eastern melodies. Matthews also extends his own repertoire of vocal strategies on this track and elsewhere as he explores a range of growls, guttural moans and fervent, upperregister wails. Sassy background vocals lend a sensual R&B feel to ""Wasting Time."" On ""Halloween"" and ""The Stone,"" the Kronos Quartet, an avant-garde string combo, brings a nervous disorientation to tales of fear and flight. Bela Fleck&apos;s banjo embroiders the edges of three tracks, including ""Don&apos;t Drink the Water,"" the album&apos;s first single. Even Alanis Morissette — remember her? — turns up to breathlessly croon her way through a verse of ""Spoon,"" the concluding song on Streets.
As for Matthews&apos; lyrics, well, let&apos;s just say that the Pulitzer committee won&apos;t be phoning anytime soon. His words — and there are plenty of them — read like afterthoughts to some other activity, most likely writing music. They consist largely of wacky sex chat (""Ha open wide/All so good/I&apos;ll eat you""), good-hearted pieties (""Just love will put the hope back in our minds"") and folkloric allegory (""Mommy, come quick/The dreaming tree has died"").
It&apos;s best, for that reason, to think of Matthews&apos; lyrics purely as a vehicle for his expressive voice-and to think of that voice as another instrument in this group&apos;s potent musical arsenal. For the members of Dave Matthews Band, after all, playing is the thing, and on Before These Crowded Streets they play as if their lives — and yours — depended on it.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912207618.95/warc/CC-MAIN-20190327020750-20190327042750-00138.warc.gz
175,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/beggars-banquet-188434/,"On the surface rock and roll changes at an amazing pace. The influence of a figure like the Maharishi can appear and disappear in a matter of months. Talk about old fashioned rock and roll finds itself dead before it begins. Yet some things do remain, while others maintain enough of their former selves so that the logic of their growth at least makes itself obvious.
An example of someone who doesn&apos;t change is Elvis Presley. His recent TV special was a testimony to the vitality of his original style. How many rock stars of today might be able, ten years from now, to do an hour of the songs of 1968 and make it come alive as a contemporary experience? Presley at his best is about as eternal as rock and roll can ever expect to be.
The Rolling Stones are constantly changing but beneath the changes they remain the most formal of rock bands. Their successive releases have been continuous extensions of their approach, not radical redefinitions, as has so often been the case with the Beatles. The Stones are constantly being reborn, but somehow the baby always looks like its parents.
In many ways 1968 has turned into another one of those blues revival years. The Stones were into that when it was still verboten to show up at Newport with an electric guitar. It wasn&apos;t until five years after they recorded ""King Bee"" that Slim Harpo finally made it into a white rock club. Happily, even back then, the Stones never got bogged down in the puritanism that mars so many of the English blues bands. They were from the beginning a rock and roll blues band. They may have mimicked Harpo note for note, Keith Richards may have played a straight Chuck Berry bag for three-quarters of their first album, but it always wound up sounding like rock and roll: loud, metallic, and trebly. The Stones were the first band to say, ""Up against the wall, motherfucker,"" and they said it with class.
500 Greatest Albums of All Time: The Rolling Stones, &apos;Beggars Banquet&apos;
Since that beginning the Stones have tried their hands at a lot of things: arrogance, satire, social commentary, ""psychedelia,"" lewdness, love songs, you name it. Each phase seemed to flow naturally from the one that preceded it and none of their phases ever really changed their identity as a band. In every album but one it seemed to me that they managed to feel the pulse of what was happening now and what was about to happen. For example, ""Satisfaction,"" that classic of the rock and roll age, both expressed the feelings of a moment and foreshadowed what was about to unfold: the elevation of rock and roll to the primary cultural means of communication among the young. There we were in the early summer of 1965 with folk music dead and nothing really exciting going on. And then there were the Stones sneering at the emptiness of what so many people saw all around them, not telling you to do anything about it, but letting you know that they feel it too. The music, with its incessant, repetitious, pounding guitar and drums, and that tension filled voice, was so permeated with violence that just listening to it was cathartic.
And the Stones live. If the violence of their music was cathartic, how to describe their concerts? I saw them several times during their early American tours, most memorably in Lynn, Massachussetts, in the spring of 1966. The Stones had their usual major dates lined up on their itinerary and the Lynn gig was not one of them. Lynn is a suburb of Boston and they must have decided to do a quickie number for less than their usual fee in order to fill in an open night. The concert was held in an open air football field that held 10,000 people. It rained that evening, a steady drizzle, and when they finally came on there was a lot of tension and movement.
Everyone wanted to get the show done so that they could put the money into the bank. There was no possibility of a makeup date. Jagger emerged in a tee shirt and spread his hands out like Jesus. He thanked everyone for being there and the band went into ""19th Nervous Breakdown."" The instruments were out of tune, as well as nearly inaudible. Watts had trouble keeping the beat. Everything was a mess except for Jagger, who miraculously managed to deliver. He filled the song with drive and energy and it was enthralling to hear him ringing out through the drizzle over practically no instrumental support. The band went on its disjointed way for the entire set unable to worry about the sound while the rain was pouring down on them, and Jagger continued to go his.
The crowd that night was filled with high school kids and the were very restless. A group of them had massed in front of the stage and the local DJ who had presided over the show decided to come on stage and tell the kids that the concert wouldn&apos;t go on until they all pulled back. The Stones ignored him and went on with ""The Last Time.""
As the set drew to a close they went into ""Satisfaction."" I had seen them do it under ideal circumstances a year earlier and it had been superb. They had gone through the song then with full energy and intensity and then quieted things down a little. Jagger had taken off his jacket and put it near the drums. Then he had picked up a tambourine and walked around the different sides of the stage, talking to the chickies. Towards the end, the band had picked up to full volume, Jagger had thrown the tambourine into the audience, draped his jacket over his shoulder, and done a Frank Sinatra exit. As soon as he had vanished, the band followed him. It had been an altogether beautiful and tragic spectacle.
Jagger attempted the same bit that night and got as far as picking up the tambourine. The audience broke the police line and completely surrounded the stage. Brian Jones signalled to Jagger, who was in a trance, that they had better split. The cops did their best to clear a path but by this time there were literally hundreds of kids milling around what was supposed to have been the Stones&apos; exiting area. When the Stones got into their limousines the cops started exploding tear gas. Idiots that they are, they neglected to put on masks to protect themselves from the gas and were soon incapacitated by their own tear gas cannisters. A great deal of commotion ensued but presumably the group made it out of there safely.
Violence. The Rolling Stones are violence. Their musc penetrates the raw nerve endings of their listeners and finds its way into the groove marked ""release of frustration."" Their violence has always been a surrogate for the larger violence their audience is so obviously capable of.
On Beggar&apos;s Banquet the Stones try to come to terms with violence more explicitly than before and in so doing are forced to take up the subject of politics. The result is the most sophisticated and meaningful statement we can expect to hear concerning the two themes — violence and politics — that will probably dominate the rock of 1969.
Politics has not been fashionable since Dylan left it among musicians. There have always been the few hold-outs left over from the folk music period, but despite the mass media&apos;s continually mistaken references to rock and roll as ""protest music,"" rock musicians have done remarkably little protesting. Protest is a hallmark of the liberal. It is an appeal to the conscience of the majority to remedy some injustice being done to the minority. It presupposes a belief that meaningful change can be worked out within the system. Rock and roll musicians, for the most part, don&apos;t buy that. They don&apos;t take things like government seriously unless they are forced to. They find the whole political process something worthy of contempt.
Protest singers in the past were most often ideologues who set pallid verse to semi-musical melodies. The idea that it is the music that should convey the brunt of their meaning never occurred to them. There were words and there were notes but there wasn&apos;t any music.
The people who are turning to political themes in their music now are different. They don&apos;t do it a as luxury, or for moral reasons. They are doing it because it is part of their lives and they have to express themselves in terms of how what is happening in the streets is affecting their lives.
Personal feelings are becoming increasingly related to political ones and political problems are becoming inextricably bound up with personal ones. In the United States the band which has best come to terms with these connections is the MC 5. That band isn&apos;t protesting anything. They are giving orders: ""Kick out the jams, motherfucker."" They are offering advice. ""It&apos;s time to get down with it, brother."" And they are asking questions: ""Are you going to be the problem or the solution?"" Their idea of politics includes balling, dope, eating, drinking, fighting, and music.
The 5 are young and they are seeking youthful ways to express their feelings. The Stones are a bit older, have been through a lot more, are far better musicians, and are more sanguine about their roles. But in the larger sense they are part of the same thing: there is no way they can separate themselves as human beings from what is going on ""out there."" It isn&apos;t a question of feeling sorry for people in India, as Paul McCartney seems to think. The point is that the things that keep those people in a state of near starvation are the same ones that may force John to take a drug rap, that almost sent Brian Jones to jail, and which has forced Elridge Clever into hiding. Sooner or later, something brings that home to each of us.
Beggar&apos;s Banquet is not a polemic or manifesto. It doesn&apos;t advocate anything. It is a reflection of what goes on at the Stones house, with a few pictures of the house itself thrown in for good measure. Part of what that house looks like has to do with what it&apos;s surrounded by and the most startling songs on the album are the ones that deal with the Stones environment: ""Salt of the Earth,"" ""Street Fighting Man,"" and ""Sympathy for the Devil."" Each is characterized lyrically by a schizoid ambiguity. The Stones are cognizant of the explosions of youthful energy that are going on all around them. They recognize the violence inherent in these struggles. They see them as movements for fundamental change and are deeply sympathetic. Yet they are too cynical to really go along themselves. After all, they are rock and roll musicians, not politicians, and London is such a ""sleepy town.""
They make it perfectly clear that they are sickened by contemporary society. But it is not their role to tell people what to do. Instead, they use their musical abilities like a seismograph to record the intensity of feelings, the violence, that is so prevalent now. From the beginning they themselves have been exponents of emotional violence and it&apos;s hard to imagine any group more suited to voicing the feelings of discontent we all share in these most violent of times. Wherever they wind up themselves, they are writing songs of revolution because they are giving powerful expression to the feelings that are causing it.
Musically the Stones express themselves through three basic elements: rhythm, tension, and energy. ""Street Fighting Man"" is prototypical of the approach. Drummer Charlie Watts lays down an elementary drum pattern, the same one he has been using since ""Route 66."" He strikes the high-hat with a near compulsive regularity and hits the snare drum with such a wallop it&apos;s hard to believe the sound is coming out of only one drum. The rhythm guitar is layed over the drum and is characterized by a violent attack which emphasizes the ""on"" beat. The bass pattern is simple and restrained. Like the guitar it serves to magnify the impact of the beat. The collective effect of the instrumental track is of fantastic thrust forward.
The beat is constantly being pushed, the guitars constantly re-emphasizing the basic movement of the song, the bass providing the perfect floor to the arrangement. And then the voice: Jagger is the source of the tension. At his best (definitely on this track) he sounds like he&apos;s fighting for control, fighting to be heard over the din of the instruments. For all its simplicity it is an amazingly complex style of arranging and a perfect vehicle for expressing the lyrics.
The words are beautiful. Notice how Jagger emphasizes them: ""Ev-ry where I hear the sound of charg-ing, march-ing peo-ple."" The Stones obviously revel in the images of charging people: they&apos;ve sure seen enough of them at their concerts. But they are too mature and too realistic to fall into the trap of slogans and easy answers. All they can really do is sing in a rock and roll band.
""Salt of the Earth"" continues in the same vein and serves as Jagger&apos;s tribute to the ""other half."" Lyrically, the song&apos;s point of view is again ambiguous. Jagger obviously wants to empasize with the ""common foot soldier,"" the working man, the man who is forced to throw his life away on ""back-breaking work"" without ever achieving satisfaction. On the other hand, when he looks into their ""faceless crowds,"" they look ""strange."" He has gotten to a point where he can&apos;t really come to terms with their way of thinking. Nonetheless, the tribute goes on and begins to sound a bit like a drinking song. At one point I expect them to all be standing around the bar toasting the veterans of the Spanish Civil War. The double time at the end pushes the song past that stage and helps it regain its movement and vitality. It is typical of Jagger&apos;s honesty that he was unafraid to use a soldier as symbol of ""The Salt of the Earth."" They are as much victims as anyone else.
""Sympathy for the Devil"" rounds out the group of ambiguous, socially aware songs. To me, it is the most distinguished song and performance of the year. Lyrically, it is a striking picture of a world gone mad. Cops are criminals. Saints are sinners. God is the devil. Whoever is on top makes whoever is beneath him the enemy; actually, it is always the men on top who are the enemy. Those who claim righteousness for themselves are only interested in perpetuating their own power. Those they vilify are really the righteous ones, until they achieve power for themselves. Then they imitate their predecessors and the process repeats itself through history. The narrator, Lucifer, was there when ""Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt, of pain."" He was there when ""the blitzkreig raged and the bodies stank."" And he lays ""traps for troubadors who get killed before they reach Bombay."" And who is telling us all this? A man of wealth and taste. Sounds like what a lot of people would like to become.
The music is brilliant. The cut opens with just the percussion—a sort of syncopated Bo Diddley, precisely the kind of thing Watts excells at. Then they add Nicky Hopkins&apos; rhythm piano, perfectly understated. Wyman&apos;s simple bass line matches Watts syncopation perfectly. Throughout the cut he adds color to the basic rhythm pattern by throwing in some very pretty, loopy bass lines. After two verses of Jagger&apos;s singing, the background voices add that ultra simple ""oo-oo"" accompaniment which continues to grow for the duration of the cut. By the time they reach the end, they sound like a plane taking off, accelerating at an inexorable pace until it finally reaches its normal flight speed, at which point it levels itself off.
Jagger sings with tension and control, constantly pushing himself as far as he can go, but never crossing over that line between power and excess. The guitar solo by Richard is among the finest rock solos I have heard recently. He only uses about five of the simplest rock lines around but he plays them with such finesse they seem to be oozing out of the guitar. His style is pure eroticism and he seems to linger over each note, making sure it comes out exactly like it&apos;s supposed to.
Watts, with Jagger, provides the energy. He keeps his little riff going like a computer. Towards the end he expands his part by a bit: he starts throwing out cymbal smashes on the first beat of each measure. It provides just that extra bit of rhythm and drive.
The rest of the album is made up of largely conventional Stones styled songs. There are some mediocre ones among them, but then that&apos;s part of the Stones. Consistency is not their bag. Among the really fine cuts are ""Doctor, Doctor,"" ""No Expectations,"" ""Factory Girl"" and ""Stray Cat Blues."" ""No Expectations"" is noteworthy for its sentimental melancholy. It has a lovely country feel to it, without actually being an attempt at country music. ""Factory Girl"" is more of the Stones interest in the working class (remember ""Backstreet Girl"") and has a New Lost City Ramblers-type accompaniment, complete with old-timey styled fiddle.
""Stray Cat Blues"" is easily the best of the lot and is pure Stones. It deals with their favorite subject: naughty boys and girls. The lyrics are about a groupie and Jagger comes up with some very tough lines: ""I&apos;ve heard you&apos;re fifteen years old/But I don&apos;t want your ID"" and signs off with ""I&apos;ll bet your mother don&apos;t know you can bite like that.""
Musically, it is one of the songs that make use of the rhythm, tension, energy pattern mentioned earlier. The verse is in the form of one of those great Between the Buttons cuts, ""All Sold Out."" That is followed by a simple chorus. Later, a second chorus is added on top of that, (""Oh yeah, you&apos;re a stray, stray cat . . . "") Each element of the structure adds to the tension of the body of the arrangement. But at the end of each chorus the energy level drops back down to that of the more restrained verse part of the song. It provides the listener with a perfect release. Instrumentally, Keith Richards&apos; performance is again brilliant.
Beggar&apos;s Banquet is a complete album. While it does not attempt Sgt. Pepper-type unity it manages to touch all the bases. It derives its central motive and mood from the theme of ""revolution"" but isn&apos;t limited to that. Over at the Stones house there&apos;s plenty of room for groupies, doctors, jigsaw puzzles, factory girls, and broken hearts as well. Yet even these subjects are colored by the impact of ""Sympathy for the Devil"" and ""Street Fighting Man."" Beggar&apos;s Banquet ought to convince us all that the Stones are right. By putting all these different themes on the same album the Stones are trying to tell us that they all belong together. They do.
The art work in this album is quite nice. The center spread is a particularly appealing depiction of the Stones acting out the album&apos;s title. However, it continues to grate on me that the cover of the album is not what the Stones intended, and that the Stones were forced to abandon the one they had originally intended to use by London Records. The idea that a record company executive should have the right to tell the Stones what is a suitable cover for their album is an outrage. It is typical of the Stones that they held out against the new cover for quite a while and then gave in. It just wasn&apos;t worth the continued hassle. Nonetheless, giving in doesn&apos;t solve the problem. As long as record companies are run by businessmen, artists will never achieve full control over how their art is presented to their public. There has been too much glib talk lately about the power of musicians. Unless musicians organize themselves more effectively, and unless journalists give them all the support they can, things like this will happen again and again. The First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech but it doesn&apos;t forbid a record company from censoring the artists it controls via an exclusive recording contract.
The next time New York&apos;s East Side revolutionary contingent wants to shake somebody up (besides Bill Graham), why don&apos;t they head uptown to London Records? I&apos;m sure the President of London Records could use the education.

176,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/being-there-203447/,"A funny thing happened to singer/songwriter Jeff Tweedy on the way to cult stardom. As a member of Uncle Tupelo, a band of Midwestern small-town teens that initially took its cue from &apos;80s punk, he discovered Merle Haggard, the Louvin Brothers, Hank Williams Sr. and Gram Parsons, the patron saints of roots rock, country division. And with the zeal of a true disciple, Tweedy — together with Tupelo&apos;s co-founder, singer/songwriter Jay Farrar — strived to create a musical language as earthy, honest and personal as that of his heroes. When Tweedy and Farrar split, in 1994, leaving Tupelo in ruins, they left behind four rustic-flavored albums and a rabid following that bowed to the boys from Belleville, Ill., and hailed them as visionaries.
Posthumously, Uncle Tupelo have acquired a mythic status that far out-strips their meager record sales. The title of the group&apos;s first album, No Depression, has become the all-purpose moniker for a nationally prominent fanzine, a boisterously active Internet folder and a new school of country-minded rock bands, including Tweedy&apos;s post-Tupelo outfit, Wilco, and Farrar&apos;s band, Son Volt.
Wilco and Son Volt both put out debut discs last year, and the loyalists are still jousting over which group is the true keeper of the No Depression flame. But with Being There, the follow-up to Wilco&apos;s 1995 release, A.M., Tweedy and his band break free from the confines of the narrow Tupelo legacy by exploring the nuances of noise and atmosphere.
The 19 tracks on Being There are spread across two CDs — a sound aesthetic decision. Each disc functions as a self-contained entity digestible in a single 40-minute sitting. Together, both halves aspire to the nervy sprawl of such double-album predecessors as London Calling and Exile on Main Street, records that forged unified personal statements out of a bewildering variety of styles. Being There is a product of ambitious versatility, particularly in the string-band textures conjured by multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston and the pliant rhythms of bassist John Stirratt and drummer Ken Coomer. Wilco explore the clavinetfueled funk of the Band on ""Kingpin"" and crank up the Sun Sessions-style reverb on ""Someday Soon."" The band also bounces like the Beatles in a dance hall on ""Why Would You Wanna Live"" and evokes an air of desert mystery in ""Hotel Arizona.""
Wilco announce their ambitions in the opening bars of ""Misunderstood"" with a feedback-drenched assault that should clear the room of any Carter Family purists. The cacophony gives way to a plaintive acoustic dirge as Tweedy inserts a quote from ""Amphetamine,"" by the late Pere Ubu guitarist Peter Laughner: ""Take the guitar player for a ride/See, he ain&apos;t never been satisfied/He thinks he owes some kind of debt/Be years before he gets over it."" The lines are apt; Wilco identify strongly with Laughner&apos;s tortured romanticism. In the next song, ""Far Far Away,"" Tweedy is on a bus, watching the prairie whir past as he drives away from a loved one. By ""Monday,"" Tweedy has forgotten all about home as his and Jay Bennett&apos;s guitars blast against a braying brass section like the Stones invading Memphis. ""I only wanna go where my wheels roll,"" Tweedy yelps.
Wilco have not made your standard rock & roll road album. Tweedy&apos;s songs use the one-nighter clichés of Grand Funk Railroad&apos;s ""We&apos;re an American Band"" as a means of exploring deeper issues, particularly faith and commitment and how those qualities are tested by geographical and emotional distances. Being There is an album of parallel journeys that frequently overlap, a tour of the heart that becomes a search for renewal.
These journeys do not follow straight lines. Being There swings from the cocky-guitar raucousness of ""Outtasite (Outta Mind)"" on the first disc to the fatalistic acoustic strumming of ""Someone Else&apos;s Song"" on the second CD. ""Sunken Treasure"" is a jazzy, Astral Weeks-style reverie that unravels into a dissonant eruption worthy of Sonic Youth. When Tweedy sings, ""I am so outta tune with you,"" he could be describing any of the relationships depicted in his songs — with a lover, a friend, even the music. The ambiguity is an attraction in itself.
On Being There&apos;s penultimate track, ""The Lonely 1,"" the perspective shifts from that of the self-absorbed rock singer in ""Misunderstood"" to that of a fan who lives vicariously through music. Fittingly, the album closes with ""Dreamer in My Dreams,"" a ramshackle rave-up that sounds straight out of Rod Stewart&apos;s Gasoline Alley. In the song, Tweedy concedes that ""All the good things/They gotta go,"" but the band holds tight to the tune, pulling it back together each time the arrangement nears collapse.
Being There is named after the 1979 movie with Peter Sellers, and like Sellers&apos; memorable character, the gardener Chance, Jeff Tweedy and Wilco venture out into an anxiety-ridden world sure of only one thing. For Chance, it was the feeling of security he left behind in the garden. For Wilco, it is the solace they continue to find in rock & roll.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204077.10/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325153323-20190325175323-00221.warc.gz

183,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/best-of-the-animals-185855/,"With the Fifties rehashed past the point of musical surfeit, the rich body of Sixties rock must now have its day. Important innovations like surf music and the girl-group sound (particularly Phil Spector&apos;s creations) have already been resurrected. And now the music of the crucial, nearly ten-year-old British invasion, so significant in revitalizing the spirit of rock & roll in &apos;64-&apos;65, is being revived as well.
 
British Invasion bands can be divided into two categories — those inspired by classic Fifties rock &apos;n&apos; roll and hard-core R&B, and those who derived their approach from early Sixties pop music. ABKCO Records&apos; first two British anthologies feature one group of each type. The Animals, with the Stones, were the most prominent example of the former (other important contributors including Manfred Mann, Them, the Pretty Things and the early Yardbirds and Who), and they were exceptionally adept at it. With Eric Burdon&apos;s impassioned vocals and Alan Price&apos;s creative organ superimposed over a throbbing rhythm section, their &apos;64-&apos;66 (pre-psychedelic) legacy is one of the most impressive of the era.
Best of the Animals, despite a certain shoddiness, conveys the rocking excellence of the group. Hits like ""Baby Let Me Take You Home,"" ""I&apos;m Crying"" and ""It&apos;s My Life"" sound great, and the neglected flip side, ""Cheating,"" is a fine rocker. But the amusingly cheesy cover, irrelevant liner notes, general brevity and randomized order are all detriments. More importantly, three of the Animals&apos; biggest and best &apos;66 hits, ""Don&apos;t Bring Me Down,"" ""See Rider"" and ""Inside Looking Out,"" are missing and unaccountably replaced by a multitude of odd and often unimpressive LP cuts. There&apos;s also a strange and inferior alternate take used for ""We Gotta Get Out of This Place.""
All is almost forgiven for the inclusion of the Animals&apos; crowning achievement, ""The Story of Bo Diddley."" It&apos;s a humorous capsule history of rock & roll, which utilizes all the right cliches and incorporates interesting snatches of key historical hits, from Johnny Otis&apos; ""Crazy Country Hop"" to a contemptuous bit of ""Take Good Care of My Baby,"" together with snatches from the Beatles and Stones. Price&apos;s organ holds it together, and Burdon&apos;s sardonic commentary culminates in Bo Diddley describing the Animals as ""the biggest load of rubbish I ever heard in my whole life!"" You might pick up the anthology for this cut alone (but you might be better off hunting for the original on Animal Tracks and looking for other old albums as well).
Herman&apos;s Hermits&apos; package comes off better — 18 of 20 tracks (a shamefully scanty total for a purportively comprehensive anthology, especially when all the cuts are of the two-minute variety) were legitimate hits. The other two cuts (flip sides) are OK, although the compilers might have opted for two big British singles, ""Show Me Girl"" and ""You Won&apos;t Be Leaving,"" instead. The LPs reveal once and for all that Peter Noone & Co. were a first-rate pop group.
Disregard the music hall piffle (""Mrs. Brown,"" ""Henry VIII,"" etc.); Noone always took it as a purely exploitative joke, and a pretty good one on us it was. But the group recorded many excellent pop tunes with pretty melodies, fine harmonies and surprisingly solid instrumentals. Some of the best pop tunesmiths of the day churned out songs for the Hermits (Goffin-King, Graham Gouldman, Ray Davies and P.F. Sloan), and hits like ""No Milk Today,"" ""Hold On,"" ""Don&apos;t Go Out Into the Rain,"" ""I&apos;m Into Something Good"" and ""Can&apos;t You Hear My Heartbeat"" make for extraordinarily enjoyable listening.
London Records has managed to avoid shoddy anthologies by reissuing two of their early catalog items intact, with the original covers and songs. Alan Price, currently prominent via his soundtrack for O Lucky Man!, left the Animals in &apos;65 and formed the Alan Price Set, which had a number of big British hits. Some of these were gathered together on a late &apos;67 American LP called This Price Is Right, finally making its reappearance now. Price&apos;s music is cabaret/music hall-oriented, with a shuffling R&B feeling as well. His pleasantly mellow vocals and expressive piano, added to his previously demonstrated organ abilities (best exemplified here on the minor US hit ""I Put a Spell on You""), make for a thoroughly listenable LP. Five Randy Newman songs (Price was one of his earliest boosters) stand out, and originals like ""Don&apos;t Do That Again"" and ""House That Jack Built"" are also noteworthy. There&apos;s plenty more Price in London&apos;s vaults, and one hopes a second volume will be forthcoming soon.
If any group ever deserved a comprehensive retrospective it is the Zombies. As part of the reissue fever roaring through the record industry, their first hit, ""She&apos;s Not There,"" has been re-released, accompanied by their first LP. The Zombies, with their complex chord constructions, the wistful reflectiveness of their songs and Colin Blunstone&apos;s fragile, breathy vocals, were always mavericks. It shows on even their earliest work, with delightfully delicate original material like ""I Don&apos;t Want to Know"" and ""What More Can I Do"" contrasting almost irreconcilably with inept R&B renditions of ""I&apos;ve Got My Mojo Working"" and ""Can&apos;t Nobody Love You."" However, adding in their first two hits, the unforgettable ""She&apos;s Not There"" and ""Tell Her No,"" the package becomes an unqualified plus, one you shouldn&apos;t pass up if you missed it before.
There are countless Zombie delights moldering in the can or on inaccessibly rare singles or English pressings. Even taking into account London&apos;s fine 1969 Early Days package, there&apos;s enough material for an excellent anthology — if done right. With these four packages (and previous Kinks and Them collections, the former easily the most admirable effort so far), the initial steps of making the music available have been taken. Now it is up to the companies to lavish still more extensive care and attention on this lastingly vital and exciting British rock & roll — the time is definitely right.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202199.51/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320024206-20190320050206-00397.warc.gz
184,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/best-of-van-morrison-vol-2-249720/,"Though he forever pines for his lost youth, drops the heaviest names in the arts-and-letters biz (this time out it&apos;s Oscar Wilde, Samuel Beckett and the perennial James Joyce) and loses himself in obscure mystic reveries, Van Morrison has had trouble getting his vision to take flight for the past decade or so. Always an amazingly talented singer, Van has been relying too heavily on foolproof jazz-lite back-drops for his vocal gymnastics.
Too Long in Exile, his 22nd studio release, effortlessly continues this pattern. It swings, it ponders, but it never surprises. And the paranoia that has been creeping steadily into his music is dead center. ""Too long in exile/Baby, those people just ain&apos;t, just ain&apos;t your friends,"" he sings on the opening title track, which leads into ""Bigtime Operators,"" on which he insists, ""They put a bug in my apartment/To listen in on my calls.""
Fortunately, the album is peppered with covers that help alleviate these outbursts, and on those cuts, Van has a little fun. He gives Ray Charles his due with a hard-nosed rendition of Doc Pomus&apos;s ""Lonely Avenue,"" shares the stage with guest star John Lee Hooker for a sweaty workout of Van&apos;s own ""Gloria"" and segues from Brook Benton&apos;s ""I&apos;Il Take Care of You"" into his own ""Tell Me What You Want"" with unequaled grace.
However, with Van Morrison one desires more than a pleasant listening experience the least Van ever delivers. As everyone knows, certain Morrison recordings are nothing less than magical. It&apos;s the difference between Tupelo Honey, a good album, and St. Dominic&apos;s Preview, a great one.
Unfortunately, that magic also escapes compiler Mick Glossop on The Best of Van Morrison Volume Two. While containing a handful of inspired moments (of course), this collection too often seems arbitrary. Sandwiching two covers Morrison recorded with Them in the mid-&apos;60s Hooker&apos;s ""Don&apos;t Look Back"" and Bob Dylan&apos;s ""It&apos;s All Over Now, Baby Blue"" between a live ""Rave On John Donne/Rave On Part Two"" and ""One Irish Rover,"" both from the &apos;80s, is juxtaposition without context. It amplifies neither era and gives the compilation a tossed-off effect that contradicts Morrison&apos;s deliberate nature. Of the 13 tracks culled from Morrison&apos;s previous eight albums (nothing from his &apos;70s stay at Warner Bros. is included), the highlights (""Real Real Gone,"" ""In the Garden"") sit uncomfortably next to the more languid tunes.
Whatever his faults, Van Morrison&apos;s music is always intensely personal. Scaling down his grand intentions into 15 quick doses does not present a coherent picture. That approach only serves to blur further what is already an elusive, difficult career to comprehend.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201329.40/warc/CC-MAIN-20190318132220-20190318154220-00442.warc.gz

186,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/beyonce-114971/,"""Can you lick my Skittles?"" is the new ""Hurry up with my damn croissants."" Beyoncé has delivered countless surprises in her 15 years on top of the music world, but she&apos;s never dropped a bombshell like this. The Queen Bey woke the world in the midnight hour with a surprise ""visual album"" – 14 new songs, 17 videos, dropped via iTunes with no warning. The whole project is a celebration of the Beyoncé Philosophy, which basically boils down to the fact that Beyoncé can do anything the hell she wants to.
David Bowie, Kanye West and My Bloody Valentine pulled off stealth releases earlier this year. But this is a bigger deal because it&apos;s Beyoncé, music&apos;s glossiest mega-star, working with the likes of Drake, Pharrell and Jay Z. The state-of-the-art videos come from directors like Jonas Åkerlund and Hype Williams. ""Flawless"" features a speech from Nigerian feminist author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. And ""Blue"" has a cameo from her daughter, Blue Ivy, who probably won&apos;t be president until 2048 but has a head start on running the world.  The sheer number of people involved in this top-secret project, and the way they all kept their mouths shut – well, it proves that basically any conspiracy theory is plausible. The nail techs alone for 17 different Beyoncé videos? That&apos;s a mountain of nondisclosure paperwork right there. You crazy for this one, Bey.
The vibe on Beyoncé is moodily futuristic R&B, strongest when it goes for full-grown electro soul with an artsy boho edge. ""Blow,"" the best track here, evokes Janet Jackson circa The Velvet Rope, a song about oral sex that has an air of melancholy in the chilly neo-disco groove. There&apos;s a similar mood in her excellent Drake duet ""Mine.""
Beyoncé throws in too many pageant-ready ballads about believing in your dreams and reaching your goals – but the highlights are the sex songs. ""Drunk in Love"" is a superb duet with Jay Z, 10 years after ""Crazy in Love."" These two still can&apos;t keep their fingers off each other: ""We woke up in the kitchen/Saying, &apos;How in hell did this shit happen?&apos;"" Jay Z adds tasteless Ike-and-Tina jokes as he and the Mrs. lead you on a sexual tour of their stately home, from the front door (""Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol"") to the bathtub, where Beyoncé claims to ""ride it with my surfboard.""
She hits nasty highs all through the album, from the squishy slow jam ""Rocket"" (""Let me sit this ass on you"" – now there&apos;s an opening line) to the Frank Ocean duet ""Superpower."" In the fractured Timbaland production ""Partition,"" she and Jay get kind of rough in the back of the limousine. She has to warn the chauffeur, ""Driver roll up the partition please/I don&apos;t need you seeing &apos;Yonce on her knees."" But the car doesn&apos;t even get to the club before, as Beyoncé puts it, ""He Monica Lewinsky&apos;d all over my gown.""
Beyoncé may have gotten ""bored"" with the popstar routine, as she confesses in ""Ghost."" But only massive hubris could have made a feat like this album possible. And Beyoncé&apos;s hubris makes the world a better, more Beyoncé-like place.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202474.26/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320230554-20190321012554-00209.warc.gz

Garay has them trying everything, from the rap of ""Brotherhood"" to the Genesis-style pomp of ""How Long,"" but throughout, Santana exhibits more competence than enthusiasm. Even material that would have suited the band in the past, such as Curtis Mayfield&apos;s ""I&apos;m the One Who Loves You,"" falls embarrassingly flat, as singer Greg Walker fails to connect with the lugubrious rhythm section.
It&apos;s hard to blame the band for this debacle, though.

The former piece gets a mesmerizing, other-worldly texture from electric sitar, tamboura, berimbau (Brazilian musical bow) and electric guitar and has one of Miles&apos;s most lyrical lines. In effect, both pieces are all-star sessions, with John McLaughlin. Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Billy Cobham, Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul and Airto featured. ""Ife"" is the most recent performance and in many ways the most interesting, with elusive, squiggly reeds, terrific keyboards by Lonnie Liston Smith and delicately propulsive percussion by Mtume and Badal Roy. Only ""Go Ahead John"" misses, largely because two trumpets are overdubbed, causing some congestion, and because McLaughlin&apos;s solo is painfully distorted, as if it were coming through a Sears & Roebuck amp with its fuses blown.

191,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/billion-dollar-babies-255394/,"Concerning Alice Cooper, it is by now axiomatic that any new album is intended only as the soundtrack of the latest group traveling extravaganza. But even considered as a soundtrack, Billion Dollar Babies seems an abortion. The extended numbers (ones around which the stage skits revolve) are the most abrasive. Rather than following Cream&apos;s formula of presenting a tight skeleton on vinyl that can be expanded at will onstage, the Cooper troupers insist upon acting this soundtrack concept out to the bitter end. So we get to hear large stretches of the band in total sonic disarray while dentists&apos; drills roar (""Unfinished Sweet""), snakes hiss (""Sick Things"") and guillotine blades drop (""I Love the Dead""). Zero to each song.
As expected, Billion Dollar Babies doesn&apos;t cut the mustard when viewed musically, either. ""Hello Hurray,"" which opens the album and the current stage act, is a Broadway production number by Rolf Kempf (the play escapes me), once again underscoring the ""show"" aspect of the Cooper experience. The adapted version gives an interesting view of the reluctant cynicism that&apos;s an unavoidable component of the rock star existence, but does precious little else. As on every other cut the band just never manages to mesh musically, and the final chorus merely bluffs its way around becoming the intended musical conjuration of the awesome instrumental power behind a rock singer.
""Elected"" fails similarly, a victim of incredibly inept production. Alice builds the song&apos;s tone steadily throughout, then right at the top of the final chorus, just when you&apos;re expecting the thing to explode into a fist-hoisting anthem, the whole damn thing suddenly fizzles out. Guitars decelerate, horns recede ... it doesn&apos;t make any sense. For a group that&apos;s had such success with power-oriented songs in the past (""Under My Wheels,"" ""School&apos;s Out,"" ""I&apos;m Eighteen""), the approach is as mysterious as it is absurd.
Alice himself is fond of saying that ""Raped And Freezin&apos;"" is ""a classic rock & roll song in the spirit of &apos;Brown Sugar.&apos;"" Believe it if you can, but Jagger and Co. would never be as unmelodic, as given to ridiculously arbitrary tempo changes, or as dependent upon sound effects to create moods as is ole A.C. There&apos;s something about tape-recorded bullfights that just doesn&apos;t fit in with rock & roll.
Donovan and Alice swap lines on the title cut, which is otherwise no different than the rest of the album — tedium ranging from boredom to humdrumity. But seeing as how that has also been a good description of Mr. Leitch&apos;s career, his efforts here make a certain bizarre sense, something I&apos;m sure that only Alice Cooper&apos;s followers could fully appreciate.
While they&apos;re currently quite content to hide behind this ""entertainment"" facade, I know damn well that these guys can be good musicians. They did a version of ""The Train Kept A-Rollin&apos;"" once during a sound check that might have blown the Yardbirds away! Maybe we&apos;ll get a taste of this later this year when guitarist Mike Bruce releases a solo album — could be nice. But as it is now, with each member totally willing to submerge his musical development within the group personality, we&apos;ll continue to see a dependence on cheap tricks and illusions of decadence instead of rock & roll. Personally, I prefer a little music with my decadence, so please excuse me while I put Raw Power on the old Garrard.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202125.41/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319183735-20190319205735-00326.warc.gz
192,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/billy-breathes-202075/,"Phish&apos;s last album, the double CD A Live One, distilled a decade&apos;s worth of dedicated road work by a group that has reinvented improvised rock for a new generation. If Phish have an identity, it is one characterized by endless change and musical risk, a yesterday-today-and-tomorrow sound that draws liberally from rock history and jazz innovation. Combine that with a rich, interactive mythology binding the band and its audience into the coziest symbiosis since you know who, and you&apos;ve got a cultural force to be reckoned with. An exhaustive — and nearly exhausting — consolidation of Phish&apos;s tightly wound tunes and electrifying jams, A Live One, which went gold, finally gave the rock mainstream a chance to see what all the fuss was about.
Then, on their seventh record, they rested: Phish take a well-deserved breather, so to speak, on Billy Breathes, shedding much of the sophisticated trickery that has been their musical trademark. Billy Breathes, the group&apos;s first studio release in two years, is a quiet gem of an album, and it confirms that guitarist Trey Anastasio, drummer Jon Fishman, bassist Mike Gordon and keyboard player Page McConnell are much more than a jam band from Burlington, Vt., with a swelling fan base. As rustic as the New England countryside, Billy Breathes is a warm declaration of optimism packaged in concise, radio-attractive songs.
Phish&apos;s studio work has always been iffy. While the band&apos;s self-produced 1988 debut, Junta (re-released by Elektra in 1992 with extra material), still buzzes with novelty, 1993&apos;s Rift is just shy of being a great concept album. Lawn Boy (1990), A Picture of Nectar (1992) and Hoist (1994), listenable albums with bright moments aplenty, seem more like rough sketches that get a lot juicier onstage. Downright organic in comparison, Billy Breathes — co-produced by the band and Steve Lilly-white — flows like a stream dream.
The album begins with ""Free"" (first line: ""I&apos;m floating in the blimp a lot"") and ends with ""Prince Caspian"" (first line: ""Oh! To be Prince Caspian/Afloat upon the waves"") — songs that celebrate the weightless ecstasy of the group&apos;s instrumental allure. ""Character Zero"" and ""Swept Away"" start out unplugged before veering off into something wilder and more electric; ""Waste,"" ""Talk"" and ""Train Song"" have all popped up during the acoustic mini-sets that Phish recently began integrating into their shows.
If A Live One was Phish&apos;s variation on the Grateful Dead&apos;s Live/Dead, Billy Breathes is part Workingman&apos;s Dead and part Abbey Road, focused on musical essences often obscured by rock-concert spectacle. The songs — written mostly by Anastasio with his longtime lyricist, Tom Marshall (whose craft has matured big time since his ""rhinothropic microgaze"" period) — unspool guileless images of transcendence set against the struggle to evade the pitfalls of everyday miscommunication. ""Talk,"" one of several song titles reflecting the album&apos;s elegant simplicity, could be directed at either a lover or an intruding crowd: ""Nothing&apos;s ever soaking through the filter that surrounds your thoughts,"" sings Anastasio sweetly.
Birth is the subject of the loose suite of tunes that constitute most of the disc&apos;s second half — no surprise, since the album&apos;s title is a nod to Anastasio&apos;s baby daughter. With its intrauterine imagery and dank-underwater jam, ""Theme From the Bottom"" could refer to society&apos;s rejects or a resident of the womb. The blue-grass-flavored ""Train Song"" is imbued with the surreal Americana of O. Winston Link&apos;s photographs of the last steam engines; in the lyrics, passengers hope ""to review the coulds before we were born/And to invite a new game of can&apos;ts.""
The suite proper begins with Anastasio&apos;s mantralike acoustic-guitar solo, ""Bliss"" (written originally for an injured fan), which segues into ""Billy Breathes,"" an airy lullaby with the refrain ""Softly sing sweet songs."" Anastasio&apos;s sustained feedback opens onto a shimmering, Enoesque soundscape. ""Swept Away,"" an appeal for respite from a pressing mob (of fans?), glides into ""Steep,"" a psychedelic instrumental portrait of a 19th-century factory. This fades into the yearning chords of ""Prince Caspian,"" in which Anastasio longs for an austerity symbolized by a grotesque desire to have ""stumps instead of feet.""
While a folky vibe prevails in the back-porch guitar picking and the band&apos;s gorgeous vocal harmonies, condensed suggestions of Phish&apos;s style of surging stage jams are heard intermittently. The arrangements contain secrets — whispering drum brushes, the mating call of a theremin — that I didn&apos;t catch at first; they echo a wide host of influences, some obvious (the Beatles, Traffic, Jefferson Airplane and Pink Floyd), others less so. McConnell&apos;s ""Cars Trucks Buses"" recalls the funky sound of the Meters and the jazz organist Jimmy Smith, while some of the album&apos;s short, fractured song hooks almost call Pavement to mind.
Full of subtle detail and unfashionable heart, Billy Breathes changes moods like a cloudy spring day. It contains one too many ballads: ""Waste,"" with its supplication to ""Come waste your time with me,"" is just too precious. But like the band itself, Billy Breathes is a living thing, low in irony and high in deceptively laid-back ambition. Consider it a breath of fresh air from the country&apos;s biggest cult act.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201904.55/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319052517-20190319074517-00010.warc.gz
193,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/bio-202041/,"At his best Chuck Berry was a hip short-story teller, with insightful, affecting and entertaining pictures to show, set to a strong jumping boogie beat. But he never had much of a way with albums, and the problem with being chief chronicler and day-to-day historian of the ways of an era is that it fades away — and people grow older. Times and audiences change — but Berry hasn&apos;t much.
One of the best things about this current LP is the package with photos of Berry over the years — the cover shot of him as a young man bears an uncanny resemblance to him today. The title song, ""Bio,"" is built on the ever-popular Elmore James ""Dust My Broom"" riff, and the lyrics are just that — Berry&apos;s life from his first record to his Hollywood career. (Nothing, however, about the years since.) ""Hello Little Girl Goodbye"" is an I&apos;m-leaving-you-baby number, again with highly familiar structure, distinguished mostly by nice piano work. (On all but two numbers Chuck is accompanied by members of Elephants Memory, and they add a nice solid backup, working well within the limits Chuck sets — he don&apos;t like anybody getting too fancy, you understand.) ""Woodpecker"" is a pleasant little instrumental jam with riffing by Chuck — but again, nothing exceptional.
""Aimlessly Drifting"" is a slow blues, ain&apos;t-life-on-the-road-a-lonesome-bitch lament, which owes a lot to the Charles Brown standard ""Drifting And Drifting."" As a bluesman, Berry is a good rock & roll player. ""Got It and Gone"" is another guitar player song, ""Johnny-B. —Goode —Take —Thirty —Two."" ""Talking About My Buddy"" is another borrowed riff, this one from Ray Charles, ""Lonely Avenue."" The lyric is an involved and confusing tale of Berry&apos;s ""buddy"" who went on the rock & roll road and learned about life, while Chuck is coming on to this woman who he&apos;s singing the song to because she reminds him of everybody he knows. It makes some kind of sense after several playings, but it&apos;s too long and thin.
The only infectious cut that you want to play again is ""Rain Eyes,"" an almost C&W-sounding boogie number that tells a story of a Louisiana broken home — with Berry double-tracking vocal harmonies. It has all the evocative power and charm of the Berry songs of old — and it jumps steady too.
Bio is OK — but if you never hear it you won&apos;t have missed much — certainly not anything important in Chuck Berry&apos;s musical history. And if that&apos;s a harsh judgment, well, damnit, it&apos;s supposed to be. I don&apos;t know how much longer Berry can get away with putting out albums that are just all right, but I wish he&apos;d put some effort into making the really good one that he has in him.

195,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/bitches-brew-186433/,"Miles&apos; music continues to grow in its beauty, subtlety and sheer magnificence. Bitches&apos; Brew is a further extension of the basic idea he investigated in his two previous albums, Filles De Kilimanjaro and In A Silent Way. In a larger sense, however, the record is yet another step in the unceasing process of evolution Miles has undergone since the Forties. The man never stops to rest on his accomplishments. Driven forward by a creative elan unequaled in the history of American music, he incorporates each successive triumph into the next leap forward.
The wonderful thing about Miles&apos; progress is that he encourages others to grow with him. Within the context of his sound there is more than enough room for both his musicians and his listeners to pursue their own special visions. Looking back on the history of Miles&apos; ensemble, we find the likes of John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, Tony Williams, Ron Carter, and Wayne Shorter. He always seems to select the best young jazzmen in the country and then gives them the freedom to develop their own unique modes of playing. Miles is known to be a stern disciplinarian, but never a tyrant. When a man has performed with the group long enough to gain a firm footing, he leaves as a recognized giant on his instrument.
The present Miles Davis organization is certainly no exception to this tradition. There is more pure talent here than in any group of any kind currently performing. Chick Corea&apos;s piano is so full of technical and conceptual innovations that one is caught between a feeling of wonderment and the gnawing question, ""I wonder how he does all those things?"" It was about a year ago that a Downbeat reviewer went totally ga-ga trying to understand Chick&apos;s playing (he gave it ""no stars"" and complained about how far out it was), so rather than risk the record reviewer&apos;s funny farm I&apos;ll just ask you to listen to it.
Dave Holland&apos;s bass and Jack DeJonette&apos;s drums lay down the amorphous rhythmic patterns for Miles&apos; electrified sound. To put it briefly, these chaps have discovered a new way to cook, a way that seems just as natural and just as swinging as anything jazz has ever known. The soloists on the album — Wayne Shorter on soprano sax, Bennie Maupin on bass clarinet and John McLaughlin on electric guitar — are fully accustomed to this new groove and take one solid solo after another.
The freedom which Miles makes available to his musicians is also there for the listener. If you haven&apos;t discovered it yet, all I can say is that Bitches&apos; Brew is a marvelous place to start. This music is so rich in its form and substance that it permits and even encourages soaring flights of imagination by anyone who listens. If you want, you can experience it directly as a vast tapestry of sounds which envelop your whole being. You&apos;ll discover why fully one third of the audience at Miles&apos; recent Fillmore West appearances left the hall in stunned silence, too deeply moved to want to stay for the other groups on the bill. As a personal matter, I also enjoy Miles&apos; music as a soft background context for when I want to read or think deeply. In its current form, Miles&apos; music bubbles and boils like some gigantic cauldron. As the musical ideas rise to the surface, the listener also finds his thoughts rising from the depths with a new clarity and precision. Miles is an invaluable companion for those long journeys you take into your imagination.
But don&apos;t let my cerebral bent influence your listening. Whatever your temperament, Bitches&apos; Brew will reward in direct proportion to the depth of your own involvement.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202003.56/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319163636-20190319185636-00373.warc.gz
196,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/black-and-blue-86726/,"Although the Rolling Stones now sing about their children and families as often as their stupid girlfriends, we still try to retain our old image of them, under our thumbs and out of our heads. Musically, the Stones aren&apos;t the same band anymore, either, although the continued use of the same rudiments — the drumming, the ceaseless riffing, the vocal posturing — might make it seem otherwise at a hasty glance. But the band that made Black and Blue isn&apos;t the same one that made 12 x 5 or even Aftermath. But that doesn&apos;t mean today&apos;s Stones are not a great band playing great music. They&apos;re a different sort of band, playing a different kind of music.
When Mick Taylor joined, more than a guitar style changed, although what changed may have had less to do with the new guitarist than seemed obvious. By 1969, the Stones had already begun their break from simple blues and rock, remember. And even though the technically adept, emotionally sterile Taylor has been replaced officially by the rock archetype, Ron Wood, it is still fatuous to imagine the clock turning back. For at least five albums, the best Stones songs have relied on strings, horns, keyboards and eccentric vocal combinations as much as on guitar, bass and drums. No guitarist could change that. But the audience — and in a sense, I suspect, the Stones themselves — still expects each album to contain some traditional guitar rock. In a way, Black and Blue is an admirable album just for its refusal to bow to the past. A few songs here try to sound like ""Brown Sugar"" and ""Tumbling Dice"" and those few aren&apos;t the best ones.
Still, the Stones have problems. Keith Richard recently has seemed to run out of melodic ideas altogether and, like the majority of their post-Exile on Main Street repertoire, the new numbers are based on loose riffs rather than tight song structures. Consequently, the music lacks energy. (The lack of energy has been written off to age, but that is absurd. Like the Who or any rock band, the Stones are obsessed in their way with age and time, but unlike the rest, they&apos;ve matured with confident gracefulness. For Soul Survivors, I guess, dying before you get old is simply not relevant.)
What has really dissipated the Stones&apos; enormous energy is a lack of organization and control. This is most obviously displayed as a production flaw, although the lack of song structure is a symptom, too. The Glimmer Twins (Jagger/Richard&apos;s nom de production) kept control of It&apos;s Only Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll until the end, when ""Fingerprint File"" finished things with unredeemed self-indulgence. This time, they&apos;ve lost control; it took them too long to make the record, and the weariness shows.
Too much of Black and Blue picks up the trail of ""Fingerprint File."" ""Hot Stuff,"" which opens side one, and ""Hey Negrita,"" which opens side two, are intricate funk jams, fusing reggae, Latin rhythms and the Meters&apos; brand of funk without achieving the focused mood of ""Fingerprint File."" Some of the playing is exceptional — on ""Hot Stuff,"" Charlie Watts might be playing .44 magnums instead of drums — but it never coalesces to slam the message home.
A producer&apos;s more objective voice could have made the difference. Merely resequencing the songs would have helped. In the middle of a side, the repetitive sameness of ""Hot Stuff"" or ""Hey Negrita"" would have seemed less portentous, at least.
There is plenty of good stuff left, although all of it is marred by the need for fuller, firmer instrumentation. ""Hand of Fate,"" which isn&apos;t as melodic as the Stones riff usually is, is brought to life by a blistering Wayne Perkins guitar solo and Jagger&apos;s incredibly live vocal. ""Crazy Mama,"" the wild little rocker that closes the set, is hot stuff. It sounds as out of control as the Faces, although Wood doesn&apos;t play on it. (He&apos;s ""in the band,"" but he only plays on two songs.) The lyrics are marvelous: ""&apos;Cause if you really think you can push it/I&apos;m gonna bust your knees with a bullet."" Those two are the only hard rockers on the album, and the only time Jagger pulls the standard macho-demonic act, too. The former is perplexing news, but the latter may be regarded by one and all as a good omen.
Jagger&apos;s new role is as a professional singer, and he&apos;s great at it. ""Melody"" ought to be a tentative experiment with Billy Preston&apos;s jazzy keyboard sound. Instead, it&apos;s a triumph, Jagger&apos;s voice swooping and snaking around Preston&apos;s piano and harmonies. If Black and Blue leaves us nothing else, it is the knowledge that Jagger has become a total pro in a way that, of rock&apos;s great white vocalists, only Rod Stewart and Van Morrison can match. This, with the album&apos;s two ballads, ""Fool to Cry"" and ""Memory Motel,"" is material he can sing with pride until he&apos;s 50.
""Fool to Cry"" harks all the way back to the confessional style of one of Mick&apos;s original influences, Solomon Burke. He talks and cries through the number, riding against the waves of Nicky Hopkins&apos;s string synthesizer. Stalked by the same lonely terror that haunts so many recent Stones numbers, Jagger is consoled and sometimes berated by his daughter, his woman, his best friends. He opens with a neat, oblique comment on his own parenthood, another sign of his maturity. But what is finally striking about the song is that Mick Jagger is now living up to his inspirations. He tried to match Otis Redding and Marvin Gaye for power in his younger days, and failed brilliantly. Older and wiser, he proves their equal as a singer of ballads.
For ""Memory Motel,"" a sort of return to ""Moonlight Mile,"" the stops are all pulled out. Once more, Watts propels the tune with his drumming. The story begins when Mick meets a girl before last summer&apos;s tour. (The real memory motel is near the house in Montauk, Long Island, where the band rehearsed.) But it soon becomes entangled with his recollections of the tour.
The singing is nothing less than spectacular. Jagger is powerful in his yearning, almost a supplicant. But the real revelation (as always) is Keith Richard, who sneaks in some really touching lines:
Mighty fine, she&apos;s one of a kindShe got a mind of her ownShe&apos;s one of a kindAnd she use it well
This is a perfect description of Keith Richard on last summer&apos;s tour, racing forward to sing ""Happy"" and running the show with more poise than he&apos;s ever been given credit for.
But ""Memory Motel"" is more than just a vignette or two. In the end, it becomes the perfect agony-of-the-road song, for it dwells not just on the difficulties of touring, but also on the ultimate joys: As Watts moves in like a locomotive, pushing the song upward, Jagger explains in one brief flash what it&apos;s worth to him, what keeps him coming back for more: ""What&apos;s all this laughter on the 22nd floor?/It&apos;s just some friends of mine/And they&apos;re bustin&apos; down the door!"" There&apos;s no way to capture the exhilaration he expresses as his pals roust him from his reverie, lifting him away from his cares. For that one moment, at least, Jagger feels his music as deeply as he ever has.
I remember often these days how long it has been since rock was essentially a fad. Yet we still treat it cavalierly, dismissing careers on the basis of a single disliked album. We are often cruelest, too, to those who have given us most, seeing only the short term, and forgetting that we deal with careers now, not just one-shot hits. Black and Blue may not be the invincible Rolling Stones of our dreams, but that is also a virtue in its way.
Black and Blue leaves me remembering the first important lesson I learned from the Stones: ""Empty heart is like an empty life."" This may not be the same band which told us that, but those sullen teenagers would recognize this one, and be proud.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202671.79/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322135230-20190322161230-00264.warc.gz
197,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/black-celebration-192232/,"Routinely dismissed as a band of synth-pop robots, Depeche Mode actually uses its machines to make some of the most human sounds around. Black Celebration is certainly this British quartet&apos;s most melodic effort to date: the clanging disco-concrete fusion of early LPs like Construction Time Again has mellowed into a brand of brooding, romantic music only hinted at on last year&apos;s Some Great Reward. ""I haven&apos;t felt so alive in years,"" gushes singer Dave Gahan on ""But Not Tonight,"" this LP&apos;s ghostly closer, although for composer-lyricist Martin Gore, even celebration is pretty bleak.
Gore dissects his gloomy obsessions with wit and intelligence. He&apos;s abetted by his bandmates, inventive technicians who understand that machines weren&apos;t meant to sound like souped-up electric organs. Despite its campy horror-show title, ""Fly on the Windscreen — Final"" is the sort of matter-of-fact meditation on mortality most people flash on behind the wheel of a car. A bank of synths buzz ominously through the verses of ""Fly,"" amplifying the unease, then whoosh gratefully when the first chorus reaches for life&apos;s only solace: ""Come here kiss me NOW.""
Most of these ditties are unabashed love songs, albeit brutally honest — quirky ones that pick apart popular notions of emotional independence (""A Question of Lust"") and adolescent sex (""A Question of Time,"" ""World Full of Nothing"") to an itchy, mechanized beat. Songs like these and some serious image-mongering have won Depeche Mode a loyal teen following, appropriately enough. But underneath their bleached-blond, black-leather pose lurks musical maturity and a wry sensibility deserving of a wider (read adult) audience.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202484.31/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321030925-20190321052925-00558.warc.gz
198,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/black-ice-255464/,"In the world according to AC/DC, sex, money, politics and other trappings of adulthood are a sick joke — but rock is sacred. No one this side of Chuck Berry has written so many great rock & roll songs about rock & roll, and no band short of the Ramones has so militantly refused to reach beyond the basics of the form. AC/DC offer a vision of the Stones if Keith had won every argument: no concept albums, no keyboards, no disco, no ballads, no gospel choirs. And Black Ice is their best argument in years — maybe decades — that evolution is for suckers.
Keeping your sound static places all the pressure on your songwriting. And for the first time since 1990&apos;s The Razor&apos;s Edge reached Generation Beavis, guitarists Malcolm and Angus Young have written tunes worthy of their musical muscle — though not enough to fill an album. With radio-savvy producer Brendan O&apos;Brien on board, the best stuff nearly lives up to their career peaks, especially ""Rock N Roll Train,"" where the brothers Young toss fat, slashing chords at each other like knife jugglers. Drummer Phil Rudd swings beneath with inhumanly restrained beats — he&apos;s so reluctant to play a fill that he makes Charlie Watts sound like Dave Grohl.
Similarly, bassist Cliff Williams seems content to play pumping eighth notes on every AC/DC song ever — except the funky walking line he lays down on the excellent ""She Likes Rock N Roll."" Another instant classic, ""Big Jack,"" has the swagger of a long-lost Back in Black track. Even songs that rely on well-worn tricks — the two-string high-note riffing on ""Anything Goes"" recalls ""For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)"" — have enough verve to get over.
AC/DC avoid the cheerful sexism of the past (see the oral-sex ode ""Givin the Dog a Bone""). Otherwise, the words haven&apos;t changed much, aside from a new preoccupation with apocalyptic meteorology (""Skies on Fire,"" ""Stormy May Day,"" ""Black Ice""). The title of ""War Machine"" is ominously topical, but the lyrics are vague enough (""call of the wild...that thing gone wild"") to suggest that the ""machine"" is just another phallic metaphor. Phew.
Unlike original frontman Bon Scott, a born shrieker, Brian Johnson is a natural baritone, delivering tortured-weasel high notes through sheer force of will. Recently, he&apos;s sounded more wheezy than menacing at the top of his range, but O&apos;Brien has him hitting his notes again here — and the band emphasizes the choruses by returning to the rich backup vocals that enlivened its greatest hits.
For a group of guys who are so convinced they&apos;re an ""album band"" that they refuse to sell their songs individually online, AC/DC have had trouble making consistent albums since 1981&apos;s For Those About to Rock. While Black Ice pulls away from that trend, it doesn&apos;t reverse it: The album feels longer than its 55 minutes, thanks to a stretch of throwaway rockers including the mindless ""Spoilin&apos; for a Fight"" and the generic-even-by-their-standards ""Wheels.""
But there&apos;s something almost elegiac about Black Ice&apos;s multiple odes to rock — ""Rocking All the Way,"" ""Rock N Roll Dream,"" etc. These guys are true believers, fighting a war no one told them ended long ago. ""We&apos;re gonna rock &apos;round...the town/We&apos;re gonna make it right/We&apos;re gonna make it rock all night,"" Johnson yelps at one point — making it clear that his band still finds resonance in words that were clichéd by 1956. And for that, you&apos;ve got to salute them.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201922.85/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319073140-20190319095140-00390.warc.gz
199,rollingstone.com/music/,music,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/black-magic-102695/,"Don&apos;t ask me what&apos;s happened to Martha & the Vandellas. I can&apos;t figure it out either. Here&apos;s their latest album — a more respectable package than their last, Natural Resources, but another collection of odds and ends carelessly wrapped, the tissue paper fillers spilling out at the seams and packed so thick you almost chuck the whole thing out before you find the good parts.
Perhaps it is the inevitable result of the way Black Magic was organized, or disorganized. Although there is no documentation — only a ""coordinator"" is credited — the album is apparently the work of several different producers or production teams, each working on their own material. For instance, ""Bless You,"" written by the Corporation, was also produced by them, just as the other previously issued single, ""In and Out of My Life,"" was produced and written by the same team, George Gordy and Lawrence Brown — all credited on the 45s, not the album. With a likelihood of two other producers contributing to the album, and even a cut (an uninspired, tired reworking of George Harrison&apos;s ""Something"") retrieved from the last LP, the final product has a predictably paste-up, uneven quality. This is the sort of barely interested handling given unproven groups with one hit single. Martha & the Vandellas surely deserve better treatment, and that they&apos;ve been shrugged off like this by Motown for the past few years just ain&apos;t right. The heat wave may be over, but that&apos;s no reason to freeze the poor girls out.
In spite of this, Black Magic contains some very nice work and Martha Reeves, at least, survives (the tendency is to build up the Vandellas, Sandra Tilley and Lois Reeves, with an electronic ""depth"" device that makes them sound like an anonymous chorus, or place the instrumental track between them and Martha, burying the girls). The opening track, ""No One There,"" stands out as perhaps the only one worthy of the group, certainly the best thing they&apos;ve done since their 1970 single, ""I Should Be Proud."" The understated arrangement and style are reminiscent of the early Supremes or Martha&apos;s own ""My Baby Loves Me"" — bright and crisp. Lyrically, it uses the same sort of specific imagery that distinguished ""I Should Be Proud"" (left alone, Martha is tormented by ""Cars that use the driveway just to turn around/Talking to an emptiness makes such a lonely sound"") and leaves you with a vivid picture of a woman ""lying in my darkened room with love I long to share."" Martha doesn&apos;t sound as powerful as she once did; the intensity has leveled out and much of the toughness is gone, but she retains a warm, rich, insinuating quality that makes even the opening hums and moans utterly delicious Because it tries too hard to recapture the old Martha & the Vandellas feeling, the second cut, ""Your Love Makes It All Worthwhile,"" doesn&apos;t quite make it. Just when you start jumping around thinking, ""Live Wire!"" ""Quicksand!"" you notice the song&apos;s too thin, not half loud enough, has a tambourine instead of hand-clapping and Martha lacks the proper grit. Oh well.
The second best cut, written by Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson and, I suspect, produced by them, is ""Tear It Down."" It begins like a Valerie Simpson number: just a few notes on the piano, a thumping drum and Martha announcing, ""I wanna sing a song about pride — listen,"" and goes on to include the best use of the Vandellas and one of the tastiest production jobs here. ""In and Out of My Life,"" the current single, is respectable but bland. Martha comes on strong in this context and the sound, especially the bass line, is nice, but, finally, it just sort of sits there.
I don&apos;t even want to talk about the rest of this stuff: the silly ""Bless You""; a strangely out-of-joint, terribly embarrassing version of ""I Want You Back"" (I&apos;d like to see the Jackson 5 try ""Heat Wave""); a lifeless ""Anyone Who Had a Heart"" that should have been great; ""Benjamin,"" which sounds like a moderately intelligent show tune but a show tune nevertheless.
I don&apos;t understand it: Martha & the Vandellas, one of the great groups of all time, shuffling out here with this half-assed collection of tunes while the Undisputed Truth are treated like royalty. Maybe it&apos;s just Motown Politics. Or maybe the group is just very untogether right now. Oh, come and get these memories.",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203865.15/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325092147-20190325114147-00025.warc.gz
