1,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-acts-biggest-hit-cover-song/,"With bands like Disturbed, Bad Wolves and Weezer recently scoring gigantic hits by covering old classics, it’s worth noting that this isn’t anything new for the rock world. Some of the most iconic artists in rock and metal history got their biggest hit with a cover, despite building a discography filled with unforgettable cuts. Elvis Presley's most successful song was a cover of Big Mama Thornton. The crown jewel of Elvis’ untouchable body of work, “Hound Dog,” sold 10 million copies globally and became the King’s highest-selling single of his career. “Hound Dog” also topped the U.S. pop chart for 11 weeks, cementing a record which stood for a staggering 36 years. Fellow Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Joan Jett created one of music’s most illustrious solo careers after leaving the Runaways. Though Jett has graved the U.S. Top 40 a total of nine times, her only No. 1 hit is “I Love Rock ’n’ Roll,” a cover of an Arrows song from the ‘70s. Most people don’t even know Jett’s megahit is a cover, proving how synonymous the song is with rock’s leather-clad queen. Tesla’s “Signs” is instantly recognizable, but it was the second time the song was a huge hit. Five Man Electrical Band popularized the cut in 1971, selling half a million copies of the single. When Tesla made their version of “Signs,” it peaked all the way at No. 8, besting the original which only hit No. 24. Thanks to “Signs,” Tesla sold a million copies of their 1990 album, Five Man Acoustical Jam. Check out these 10 Acts Whose Biggest Hit Was a Cover Song in the Loud List above.

2,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-albums-you-wont-believe-went-platinum/,"In modern times, it’s nearly impossible for rock act to earn platinum albums. In today’s record industry, where bands who play stadiums can’t sell a million copies of an album, it’s truly surreal to look back at acts who easily got their platinum plaques in the recent past. In the 2010s, only acts like Kid Rock, Nickelback, Fall Out Boy and Paramore have been able to attain platinum status, but that’s about it. Soundgarden achieved platinum status with their Telephantism compilation, but that's because one million copies were included in packages for the video game Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock. Even the biggest names in rap and pop are having a rough time, whereas just a decade ago, groups were selling millions of albums after releasing just one radio hit. These days, it's quite an achievement for a major rock band to even earn a gold album for shipments of 500,000 copies. The 10 artists found in this Loud List aren’t necessarily bad, but most of them happen to be one-hit wonders. Remember when Ugly Kid Joe played the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards -- the same year that Nirvana stole the show with “Lithium”? That was off the strength of “Everything About You,” which led to Ugly Kid Joe’s debut album going double platinum. It’s safe to say he group hasn’t experienced the same success since. How about the post-grunge radio rock explosion of the early 2000s? Thanks to often overplayed radio hits, bands like Default and Crossfade got some pretty fat record sales, selling over a million copies of their breakout albums each.

3,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-artists-wrongly-labeled-as-satanic/,"‘Satanic panic’ has existed in music long before Tony Iommi played his first tritone. However, due to metal’s imagery, brutality and subject matter, many groups have jumped the gun to label an artist ‘Satanic.’ Here are 10 times they were dead wrong. One of the greatest videos on YouTube was shot by Dimebag Darrell himself. While Pantera were chilling in their hotel on tour, a group of Christians came in and literally tried to exorcise demons from the Cowboys From Hell. It’s absolutely hilarious to watch, especially due to the fire effects added in post-production. Marilyn Manson has been blamed for just about every negative event to happen since the early ‘90s. Religious groups were quick to claim Satan was doing his work through Manson, but in an iconic interview with Bill O’Reilly, the Antichrist Superstar brilliantly laughed off any Satanic stamp. Regardless of how well spoken Manson was, it hasn’t stopped religious groups from protesting his concerts around the country. Burzum’s Varg Vikernes is many things, including a convicted murder and a noted white supremacist, but he’s no devil worshipper. In a video on his personal YouTube channel, Vikernes dismisses any ties with Satanism and even crushes the media’s perspective on Satanism in the world of ‘Satanic black metal.’ Check out these 10 Artists Wrongly Labeled as Satanic in the Loud List above. 10 Saddest Metal Songs of All Time Top 11 Rock + Metal Drinking Songs ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204736.6/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325234449-20190326020449-00374.warc.gz

As pop stars and mumble rappers continue to be showered with media attention, every metal mention stands out like a guttural vocal at a farmers market, so we collected 10 of them for this Loud List. As if Margot Robbie didn’t already gain favor from metalheads for playing Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad, she landed even more cred by shouting out Silverstein, Bullet for My Valentine and Slipknot while guesting on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. While being interviewed by Fallon, Robbie called the Slipknot show she attended “probably the best concert I’ve ever gone to.” Robbie continued, “Even if you don’t like metal, I think you’d appreciate a Slipknot concert, because it’s incredible to watch.” Who knew that pop princess Demi Lovato grew up listening to deathcore? During an interview with Front Row Live Entertainment, Lovato spoke about Job for a Cowboy and Bring Me the Horizon as bands she continues to revisit. The “Sober” singer also reminisced about seeing Unearth and Dimmu Borgir live — headbanging the whole time, losing a shoe in the pit and crowdsurfing to the stage. Much respect. During the lifetime of iconic actor Sir Christopher Lee, he didn’t just love heavy metal — he sang it. Along with his own heavy metal records, Lee sang with Rhapsody on “The Magic of the Wizard’s Dream” and provided an epic spoken-word performance for Manowar’s “Dark Avenger.” Check out Jim Carrey, Lady Gaga, Kat Von D and more in these 10 Awesome Celebrity Metalheads in the Loud List above. 2018’s Best Metal Albums… So Far WWE Superstars on Their Dream Rock + Metal Wrestlemania Entrances ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202781.33/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323080959-20190323102959-00022.warc.gz

These rock and metal legends got so big they were offered spots on TV’s most popular kids shows… and they knocked it out of the park. Who remembers Pre-Hibernation Week? Spongebob Squarepants pulled one of the greatest cred moves in Nickelodeon history by employing the services of Pantera. The band got name-checked and everything on Spongebob, which used “Death Rattle” to score the entire “Pre-Hibernation Week” episode. If you’ve never seen Dave Mustaine’s cameo on Duck Dodgers, you’re missing out. The futuristic Daffy Duck series aired in the early 2000s, with Mustaine voicing himself as a shredder who can strike down UFOs with his guitar laser beam. Marvin the Martian didn’t stand a chance, and Megadeth’s frontman even got praise from Daffy himself in the show. One of Alice Cooper’s most iconic roles was on The Muppet Show. He had plenty of memorable moments on the legendary Jim Henson series, but we chose to highlight this scene with Sam the Eagle. As the Muppets’ resident disciplinarian, Sam didn’t approve of Alice’s antics, calling the shock rocker “demented, sick and degenerate,” which Cooper naturally took as a compliment.

Crowd surfing can be the thrill of a lifetime for a fan, and these audiences made sure our disabled friends experienced an unforgettable moment. At a recent Prophets of Rage festival show, one kid in a wheelchair didn’t just crowd surf through the gigantic crowd… a team of people carried his chair on their shoulders and carried him toward the front. You can see this guy rocking out harder than anyone in the pit and it’s got to bring a smile to your face. One Iron Maiden fan actually made it into a pro-shot concert during the band’s Book of Souls tour. To get a shoutout from Bruce Dickinson in front of tens of thousands of fans is pretty incredible. “I’ll tell you man, awesome!” Bruce said. “That’s made my year.” It doesn’t get any cooler than that!

9,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-bands-influenced-by-alice-in-wonderland/,"The time has come, my little friends, to talk of other things, of Manson, Ghost, In This Moment and other rock kings and queens. Yes, today, we are taking a trip down the rabbit hole to examine the many artists who have drawn inspiration from beloved children’s book author Charles L. Dodgson, whom you better know as Lewis Carroll, the man who penned 1865's Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and its sequel, 1871's Through the Looking-Glass. When Disney first adapted the Lewis Carroll classic in 1951, it was a groundbreaking film for the studio as it was the first to ever feature a heroine who did not have a love interest. Alice was an independent girl who let adventure and curiosity lead her. She solved her own problems, sometimes with the help of the friends she made along the way, and was not just another damsel in distress, waiting for a Prince to save her. She was strong, savvy, and eventually, became a queen for her own bravery, not because she married into royalty. This wasn’t only Disney’s first feminist film, but unfortunately, their last until the '90s. The Alice-verse has drawn so many in the alternative and metal scenes to its whimsy. This is likely because the story seems to have lots of drug references. Alice’s “trip” down the rabbit hole is often thought to be a metaphor for the hallucinations that come with using psychedelics. Many of the characters, such as the Walrus, the Caterpillar, and the Dodo Bird smoke various pipes and hookahs, and at one point, Alice is even referred to as a “weed” by the talking flowers. Not to mention, Alice consumes some “magic mushrooms” at one point. While experts do not believe this was the intent of Carroll’s imagination, it hasn’t stopped pop culture figures from interpreting it as such. In addition to the curious psychedelic metaphors, Alice’s Adventures take a very grim turn when she meets the Red Queen, a vicious tyrant who has a penchant for beheading people. No fairy tale would be complete without a villain, but there is something extra dark about the savagery of the Queen’s preferred method of murder. This is just another element that makes the sweet children’s tale metal AF. So follow us down the rabbit hole, to Wonderland we go!

10,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-bands-inspired-by-tolkien-lord-of-the-rings/,"Join us on a journey from Middle-Earth all the way to Mount Doom in Mordor to explore the realm of heavy metal bands that are heavily inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien’s timeless fantasy series, The Lord of the Rings.  It’s unsurprising that the cult novel series, which was later adapted into an award winning movie trilogy by Peter Jackson, has been often cited in heavy metal. Fantasy and mysticism are integral themes in heavy metal and in some cases, it's the foundation that many rock artists have built their persona upon.  Plus, the doomy hellscape of Mordor is a setting that rivals hell itself, making the perfect fodder for lyrical brutality. LOTR is also so much more than just mythology and escapism. It has very real themes of friendship, adventure, betrayal, greed, and mortality, evoking a genuine roller coaster of emotions with every book in the series. It is a brilliantly crafted collection of literature, blending fantasy and reality in a manner that resonates deeply with every reader, making them feel as if they are on this epic journey with our beloved protagonists. The influence of Tolkien is vast, and surfaces in a plethora of ways. Some bands have only written a song or two whereas some have written entire albums. There are even a few on this list who haven’t been known to write a single lyric about Mordor or Middle-Earth, but simply derived their namesakes from the novel. So pack your bags, grab the Pippen to your Merry, and get ready to venture though the most timeless series of all time via heavy metal and rock ‘n’ roll! Blind Guardian There are plenty of bands who worship in the house of Tolkien, but none who have made it a staple in their career quite like Blind Guardian. The power metal outfit have not only written a wealth of tunes based on Lord of the Rings, but even delivered a concept album based on the series in 1998, aptly titled Nightfall in Middle-Earth. The band is so heavily embedded within the Tolkien-verse that when news broke that the film series was on the way, rumors spread like wildfire that the band had been tapped to write the score. Disappointingly, this was untrue and a real missed opportunity for one badass soundtrack! Black Sabbath When writing “The Wizard” for Black Sabbath’s self-titled debut album, bassist Geezer Butler was reading LOTR, which inspired him to base the lyrics off of the wise wizard and Istari Order member, Gandalf. The song is a bit of a double entendre as it also serves as a metaphor for the band’s own personal wizard - their drug dealer! Burzum You certainly won’t find hobbits or wizards or elves in any  Burzum songs; however, the band name itself means “darkness” in The Black Speech, the fictional language spoken in Mordor. In fact, the word can also be found on the infamous ring inscription, which reads, “Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul/ ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.” If this sounds unfamiliar, it’s because you likely know it better as, “One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them / One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.” If you still aren’t convinced that someone as evil as Varg Vikernes would cite the works of a devout Catholic in his art, his nickname, Count Grishnackh/Greifi Grischnackh, is a nod to Grishnákh, the captain of the Orcs. Even his first band was named Uruk-Hai. This was another Black Speech phrase for “Orc-folk” and specifically applies to the strongest race of Orcs in Mordor who are the servants of Saruman the Wise a.k.a. The White Hand. Amon Amarth Much like Burzum, Amon Amarth only eponymously pays homage to Lord of the Rings. Amon Amarth literally translates to “hill of doom” and is another name for Orodruin, the volcanic “Mount Doom” in which our loving protagonist, Frodo Baggins, journeys to once and for all destroy the ring. You can’t blame them for finding inspo in Mordor because there is something just so metal about a fiery mountain of doom. Rush Rush drummer Neil Peart is a hardcore fan of literature, including the epic works of Tolkien. He first incorporated the influence of LOTRin 1975 with the song “Rivendell,” named after the majestic Elven city that is home to Elrond. Just a year later, he wrote “The Necromancer” which references the nickname Gandolf bestowed upon Sauron in The Hobbit, providing a stark contrast to the themes of “Rivendell.” The latter opus is split into three parts, likely to mimic the novel’s trilogy format. Led Zeppelin This list would not be complete without an appearance from these legends since Led Zeppelin wrote a wealth of LOTR-inspired material. Contrary to popular belief, “Stairway to Heaven” is not among them, however, the title of “Misty Mountain Hop” references the Misty Mountains or Hithaeglir. “The Battle of Evermore” is filled with metaphorical references to the book, such as the lines “The dark Lord rides in force tonight” and “The ringwraiths ride in black, ride on.” And, of course, “Ramble On,” which retells a very rock and roll version of events in which there are fair maidens in Mordor and Gollum is a girlfriend thief. Gorgoroth Gorgoroth are yet another band who cleverly and stealthily pay tribute to LOTR. While they haven’t written anything that outright references the series, The Plateau of Gorgoroth is a wasteland laden with volcanic ash in the heart of Mordor. This is where Sauron’s army can be found, waiting for his commands and looking out for any potential intruders. Megadeth When coming up with the title for Megadeth's Endgame track, “This Day We Fight,” Dave Mustaine reflected on Aragorn’s moving battle speech in The Return of the King and drew his inspiration from there. As the trilogy comes to a dramatic conclusion, Aragorn leads the Army of the West in their final fight against Sauron. Seeing the fear in his army’s eyes, he delivers a rousing motivational speech. “...I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day. An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the Age of Men comes crashing down, but it is not this day! This day we fight!” Sabaton This Swedish power metal outfit Sabaton are known for their frequent lyrical themes of war and fantasy, which makes it unsurprising that their song “Shadows” from 2007’s Metalizeris all about Mordor and the terrible army of the evil Sauron, the dark lord who created The Ring. Dimmu Borgir As I compiled this list, I developed a newfound appreciation for Norwegian black metallers Dimmu Borgir and how they have subtly paid homage to Lord of the Rings  without being too ostentatious about it. It’s like planting little secret nuggets that only the most devout Tolkien fans would notice. Dimmu Borgir is no different. While they make no direct references to the novels, frontman Shagrath’s namesake is a play on the name Shagrat, the orc captain of the tower of Cirith Ungol. If there’s a lesson to be learned here, it’s that J.R.R. Tolkien is a beast at coming up with black metal band names without even trying!   ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202476.48/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321010720-20190321032720-00374.warc.gz
11,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-bands-who-influenced-iron-maiden/,"Iron Maiden are one of heavy metal’s more enduringly popular and influential bands.

After scouring the Internet for the most bizarre groups we could find, here are 10 Bands You Won’t Believe Actually Exist. Many of these acts have been labelled “The Weirdest Band in the World” by media outlets, including Estonian rock band Winny Puhh. The 2013 performance you’ll see in this clip features the band dressed like wrestling werewolves hanging upside down while screaming maniacally. Note the spinning two-man drum kit in the back as well. This was actually broadcast on Estonian television in an eliminator for the Eurovision song contest. Another of our personal favorites is the Radioactive Chicken Heads, a comedic band fronted by a punk rock carrot and backed by an army of chickens. Picture the Dead Kennedys on acid. Another ridiculous act on this list is Mac Sabbath, a Black Sabbath cover band dressed as demonic McDonalds characters who turn Sabbath classics into food-based cuts.

Sure, we’ve all rocked out to “Sabotage” and “Fight for Your Right (to Party)” but New York City’s finest have even harder rocking songs to offer. Defunct since the 2012 death of Adam ‘MCA’ Yauch. The Beasties Boys broke down barriers between hip-hop and rock, and even introduced the mainstream to hardcore punk (they were a hardcore quartet before morphing into a hip-hop trio). The Beastie Boys even paid tribute to metal, inviting Slayer’s Kerry King to shred on “No Sleep Till Brooklyn.” The three MCs sampled some of rock and metal’s biggest bands for their work. You can clearly hear Black Sabbath’s iconic “Sweet Leaf” riff on the Beasties’ Licensed to Ill track “Rhymin’ and Stealin’.” The Beastie Boys’ major label rap debut features “Rock Hard,” a song that samples AC/DC’s “Back in Black” riff. The out-of-print song was meant to be released on the Sounds of Science anthology, but AC/DC  -- who never approved the sample -- pulled the plug on those plans.

16,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-best-cannibal-corpse-songs/,"Cannibal Corpse, one of death metal's original purveyors of brutality, continue to stay on top over 25 years into their career. With 13 albums under their belts, the Buffalo-turned Tampa veterans have been hacking, sawing, bludgeoning, and carving their way into the heavy metal pantheon, widening and deepening the grooves etched into its walls with each successive release. Never straying from their lyrical path, some would call the band a one-trick pony, but those people are forgetting that the best thing about riding a pony is that it never throws you off; you always know what to expect from the pony, which is why you got on it in the first place. Throughout the last quarter century, Cannibal Corpse have endured a host of lineup changes, with bassist Alex Webster and drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz being the only original members left. In spite of this, they have remained remarkably consistent in their output. This makes for a difficult task trying to cut down the band's extensive discography into a short list of the 10 Best Cannibal Corpse songs, but after careful consideration and smashing our faces against our desks, we've got it all figured out. Get ready for some windmilling as we count 'em down! The opening track off Gore Obsessed is a pummeling that's all over before two ticks of the minute hand pass. The chorus features some of vocalist George 'Corpsegrinder' Fisher's finest moments, displaying gutturals that come from the depths and those menacing highs that no death metal vocalist is able to replicate with such conviction. The guitar work here is familiar and unmistakably Cannibal Corpse, but there's a certain energy on it that truly sets it apart from so many other songs. We never claimed that Chris Barnes was a well-adjusted man. No. 9 on our list of the 10 Best Cannibal Corpse songs sees the sophomore track off 1994's The Bleeding make the cut. Over the years, Barnes became more intelligible with his defining death growl, which only makes songs like ""F---cked With a Knife"" that much more sickening. The title really says it all, so we'll leave the discovery of the rest of the gory details to you. Cannibal Corpse made quite the splash in 2006 when they released 'Kill.' Heralded as one of the band's best albums, it features a relentless batch of songs, including the fan-favorite ""Make Them Suffer."" Through frenzied guitar work and a swirling mass of riffs, the guys fire on all cylinders and toss in an unforgettable vocal hook to make this one of the best songs the band has ever written. Perhaps one of the catchiest Cannibal songs, ""Sentenced To Burn"" rides an undeniable groove that has surely encouraged some solo bedroom slam dancing and probably one or two red-faced explanation as to what those limb-flails are categorized as. Despite being one of the most straightforward songs from the band, it has a replay value that can't be ignored. ""Devoured By Vermin"" was the first taste fans got of former Monstrosity vocalist George 'Corpsegrinder' Fisher replacing the infamous Chris Barnes. A tortured shriek welcomes the album and the rest of the band wastes no time getting down to business, immediately putting on a convincing display that Cannibal Corpse are no worse for the wear without their iconic original vocalist. Cannibal Corpse are known for slowing things down occasionally, acting like a steamroller slowly crushing you underneath. The band is deceptive yet foretelling within the first few seconds, letting fans think they're going to be treated to one of those slow, crushing death metal hymns. The pace picks up quickly, but they don't forget to slow it back down to let Corpsegrinder's agonized high shrieks play their part in the chorus. ""This next song is about shooting blood out of your c-ck!"" Those are the words that typically precede this song live as Corpsegrinder always gives an introduction to each song. The song follows up album opener ""Hammer Smashed Face,"" which is quite the difficult task. With tug-of-war like tempo changes, ""I C-m Blood"" sees the band pull familiar tricks out of their bag of brutality that helped define the sound of one of the genre's best and enduring bands. ""A Skull Full of Maggots"" is actually one of the nicer Corpse songs, at least by gruesome comparison. The song clocks in at just over two minutes, but this is plenty of time for the band to work their way through some of the best sounds of the early death metal days. A live staple to this day, the includes a scream-along of the word ""MAGGOTS!"" for Cannibal fans to eat up. ""They think they know who I am / All they know is I love to kill! / Face down, dead on the ground / Find me before another is found!"" Anyone who's seen Cannibal Corpse live has screamed these words out after those infamous guitar chugs kick the song off. Considering their uncompromising brutality, the band know how to write a hook or two, striking the oddest balance you can find to define their style. You didn't expect to see any other song at No. 1, did you!? ""Hammer Smashed Face"" is not only the best Cannibal Corpse song, but arguably the finest contribution to the death metal genre on the whole. These riffs have bored their way into the brains of metalheads for nearly 25 years and still induce a some of the most violent mosh pits around. The tale of bludgeoning veiled through what can loosely be considered hooks is pure devastation, reigning over any other Cannibal Corpse song there is. Now that we've wrapped up what we think are the 10 Best Cuts from Cannibal Corpse, we want to hear from you! What do you think is the best Cannibal Corpse songs and what songs should have made the list? Let us know in the comments below.

17,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-best-guns-n-roses-videos/,"During their first era, Guns N' Roses were a fixture on MTV and the music video network's backing of the band's artistic vision helped the group on their trajectory to the top of the rock world. As the band continued their rise, their videos proved to more elaborate. They even managed to tie several of their clips together into what amounts to a conceptual trilogy. As time has passed, Guns N' Roses' visual representations have almost become as well known as their songs. With that in mind, we took a look back at some of the band's best clips. Join us in reflecting on the 10 Best Guns N' Roses Videos below. Part of what made the early era of Guns N' Roses so great was the pure unabashed energy and the ability to fully embrace their performance. You get a glimpse of that in the band's ""Garden of Eden"" video, as Axl Rose mugs for the camera's fisheye lens while his bandmates rock and stomp around behind him. It's a simplistic video idea but one that works incredibly well. During the 'Use Your Illusion' era, there was no hotter ticket than to see a Guns N' Roses show. One look at the band's ""Live and Let Die"" video and you can see why. The frenzied performance of Axl Rose combined with one of the baddest bands in the land made for an infinitely watchable experience. Part of the band's ""trilogy,"" ""Estranged"" opens with the definition of the word ""illusion"" as a form of deception. In one of the more cinematic videos in the band's canon, a SWAT team crashes in on Axl Rose's home as the singer lays balled up in a barely conscious state, somewhere between reality and a dream state where dolphins swim along the Sunset Strip. What does it all mean? Watch and come up with your own interpretation. Life on the road can be a lonely place, as expressed in the Guns N' Roses video for ""Patience."" Axl Rose whistles and wistfully sings about a faraway love while viewers watch a series of hotel rooms, corridors and lobbies. Never has room service seemed like such a solitary action. The clip paints a mood fitting of the song and stands out as one of their better videos. There are no special effects or high concepts here, but there's something iconic about the video for ""Sweet Child O' Mine."" Whether its the leather-jacketed, top hat wearing Slash noodling away during the song's opening moments, the bandana-sporting Axl or Duff McKagan in his CBGB shirt, this black-and-white, grainy looking video is THE look we most often associate with the band. It's primarily a performance clip of the band rehearsing while various crew and entourage members hang out. While it's a fly on the wall feel, we're pretty jealous of those who just got to hang out during even the pre-show moments to witness the brilliance. Guns N' Roses' rise to the top was pretty meteoric and you get the feel of that in their ""Paradise City"" video. In just a short time, the band found their way to playing stadiums and in the ""Paradise City"" clip you see the expanse of the empty venue during soundcheck as the band prepares to entertain, some of the backstage moments and the crowd beginning to flow in for what proved to be an electrifying performance. As we've seen over time, it's hard to make a video for a soundtrack song that incorporates footage from the film that doesn't seem cliche. But for their song ""You Could Be Mine,"" which turns up in the Arnold Schwarzenegger blockbuster Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the band has fun with it. Part performance piece, part movie promo, ""You Could Be Mine"" scores with Schwarzenegger willing to shoot scenes to tie it all together as the Terminator weaves his way through a crowd ready to target the band. As part of the Guns N' Roses video trilogy, Axl Rose finds himself in pretty dire straits again in the ""Don't Cry"" video. Scenes of a bitter spat involving a gun, shots of him attempting to stay afloat while being pulled under water and helicopters with spotlights hovering oh so close as the band performs above a tall building set the tone. Themes of jealousy, death and relationships gone bad also permeate the clip, with the video ending with Axl looking upward from a grave that bares his name and a baby emerging from a bath. As Axl writes at the end of the video, ""There's a lot goin' on."" Our first real glimpse of Axl Rose was hopping off a bus and entering ""the jungle,"" so to speak. ""Welcome to the Jungle"" found the singer being introduced to a whole new world, one filled with ""fun and games."" Quick hitting shots meant to portray society's fascination with sex, war and violence as played out on TV, while visuals of the band's raucous performance fill out the rest of the clip. It's a powerful first visual statement and one that has stood the test of time. If you're confused by the ""Don't Cry"" and ""Estranged"" videos, perhaps ""November Rain"" can help tie it together. The epic clip centers on the wedded bliss of a love fulfilled followed by the agony of a love lost. We also get a full-on backing symphony, some pretty powerful visuals of Slash rocking a guitar in a dusty church courtyard, a somber funeral procession and Axl Rose waking in a sweaty panic. We've shared our favorite Guns N' Roses videos. Now tell us yours. Let us know what you would add and subtract from this list in the Comments section below.

18,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-best-hard-rock-albums-2018/,"2018 was a rich year for hard rock, with some of the genre’s biggest bands releasing new albums. Whether from rejuvenated acts, longtime headliners or up-and-comers, here are the 10 Best Hard Rock Albums of 2018. Alice in Chains are more likely to disavow the Seattle Seahawks and become a Nirvana cover band than to release a bad album. The title Rainier Fog perfectly encapsulates everything Alice in Chains’ sixth full-length represents. Even when there’s rays of sunlight poking through (see “Never Fade”), this record is 53 minutes of gloom that lingers like the grey skies. It’s a change of pace for the grunge legends, who lean less on riffs, opting to conjure moods that, at times, are a few shades darker than some of their classic material. With every new album, Halestorm cement their status as one of hard rock's elite bands. Vicious isn't a dramatic shift from previous releases, but does provide a honing and sharpening of their sound. From the raucous chart-topping single “Uncomfortable” to the sexually charged “Do Not Disturb,” Halestorm aren’t resting on their laurels. Oh Maynard, what can’t you do? A Perfect Circle’s latest full-length, is the follow-up to 2004’s Emotive, yet it has more in common with the languorous skewed hard rock of 2003’s Thirteenth Step. The lion’s share of Eat the Elephant may have been composed by multi-instrumentalist Billy Howerdel, but once again, it’s Keenan who provides the emotional meat of the album’s impact.

The year also saw a re-emergence of the punk scene with some bright new faces on the scene. There were also still a few vets from the '70s continuing to make their mark. And industrial rock was beginning to creep in on the mainstream. While hard rock hadn't yet reached the commercial mass it would have in the '90s, 1988 gave us plenty to chew on and was huge for a few bands in providing the building blocks to a stellar career.

20,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-best-hard-rock-albums-of-1998/,"The times, they were a changin' in 1998. The grunge era that had dominated the decade was starting to fade out and even the remaining stars of the genre had begun to evolve their sound in order to survive. As one major movement expired, another one was knocking down the door to take its place, as what many dubbed nu-metal was making its presence felt in a big way. A fresh wave of harder-edged rock bands emerged, some employing rap styles in their aggressive approach. Others who were just plain heavy also seemed to get lumped under the nu-metal umbrella as well. And a few grunge vets and nu-metal progeny heavily populate this list. But the bands that fall outside of those descriptors and created their own path are the ones with perhaps the biggest impact on music.

In this Loud List, we count down our picks for the 10 Best Hard Rock Albums of 2017. In the rock realm, 2017 was Stone Sour’s year. With the release of Hydrograd, Stone Sour scored their fourth No. 1 song on the Active Rock chart with “Song #3.” Stone Sour also won two honors at the 2017 Loudwire Music Awards, taking home a ‘Hand of Doom’ for Hard Rock Artist of the Year and Hard Rock Album of the Year. We had two other hard rock forces, Starset and Nothing More, perform at the 2017 LMAs. Starset increased their star power with the new album Vessels, which peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard 200 chart. Nothing More released the masterful The Stories We Tell Ourselves this year, peaking at No. 15 on the Billboard 200. Both albums placed high on our year-end list. As for punk, Australian champs Frenzal Rhomb put out a fiendishly catchy album, Hi-Vis High Tea, this year. Clocking in at under 35 minutes, the 20-song record outlines Aussie drug culture, classic punk humor and Frenzal’s utilization of their favorite word, which begins with a “c.” If you’re looking for some solid modern punk, throw this album on.

23,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-best-metal-albums-1998/,"1998 didn’t go down as a banner year in heavy metal history, but then, things could have been worse – in fact they had been much worse, verging on cataclysmic, in recent times … Since the advent of grunge, in fact, heavy music (at least the kind performed in leather, not flannel) had generally been marginalized in America, if not the rest of the world, and the recent emergence of nu-metal as a commercial bright spot offered little consolation. So as one looks back at the strongest, most enduring albums released in 1998, the overarching impression is that of a transitional period: one where numerous younger styles – nu-metal, stoner metal, goth-metal, etc. – were still scratching for a foothold, while one older style, in particular – death metal – had achieved maturity and was producing some of its best works. ’98 was also unkind to heavy metal’s wizened ‘80s survivors, most of whom issued LPs not worthy of this list, but that of course meant hope for the future in the shape of many impetuous upstarts with nothing to fear, and everything to gain. The final selection of the 10 Best Metal Albums of 1998 therefore turned out, half grab bag, half death fest, but one thing’s certain: it’s rarely predictable and never boring.

Among the relative newcomers are bands like Power Trip, who have reignited old school thrash with a sensational year on the back of Nightmare Logic, meanwhile Code Orange appear to be the next big thing in hardcore upon issuing Forever.

You can check out Loudwire’s full Top 30 list, but we compiled our Top 10 picks for this video Loud List. 2018 was an incredible year for Judas Priest. The Metal Gods released Firepower, which is widely considered their best album since 1990’s Painkiller. When a band’s nearly 50 years into their career, fans are usually lucky if a new album contains one song that’ll make a greatest hits compilation. For Judas Priest, they cranked out career defining cuts like “Lightning Strike,” while expanding on their versatility with “Never the Heroes” and “Sea of Red.” This year’s best surprise came on 4/20, when Sleep released The Sciences with zero warning. The band’s first album since Dopesmoker was an instant classic, exhaling doom-ridden cuts that’ll melt you into the couch. With their classic take on Sabbath worship, Sleep wrote some all-timers with “Giza Butler” and the battle hymn “Antarcticans Thawed.” 2018 was arguably the year of Ghost. With Tobias Forge publicly unmasked due to a lawsuit from his former bandmates, the mystique of the Swedish occult band was in jeopardy. However, with the introduction of Cardinal Copia and the anthem-filled Prequelle, Ghost became bigger than ever thanks to massive cuts like “Rats” and “Dance Macabre.” Check out our picks for the 10 Best Metal Albums of 2018 in the Loud List above. 2019’s Most Anticipated Hard Rock + Metal Albums ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201521.60/warc/CC-MAIN-20190318172016-20190318194016-00151.warc.gz
26,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-best-metal-songs-2013/,"The best metal songs of 2013 display how wide-ranging the genre has become. While all of the tunes fit within the metal universe, several of these bands are vastly different from one another. After much debate, we've compiled our list of the 10 Best Metal Songs of 2013, which features songs from veteran metal pioneers, extreme metal mavens, metalcore heroes, experimental acts and much more. In celebration of the year in metal, check out our picks for the 10 Best Metal Songs of 2013 below: From: Pinnacle of Bedlam Suffocation delivered another slab of death metal brutality and technical prowess in 2013. 'Pinnacle of Bedlam' is the band's first post-reunion album without acclaimed drummer Mike Smith as Dave Culross mans the sticks. The album starts off with 'Cycles of Suffering,' which is an instantaneous punch delivered to the gut. Frank Mullen's gutturals being immediately brutal as an all out riffing assault bombards the listener and brings the pain. From: 'One of Us is the Killer' The Dillinger Escape Plan are one of modern metal's most dynamic and unpredictable bands, both live and in the studio. 'When I Lost My Bet' is a shining example of this notion, as the band switches between hardcore riffing, dizzying lead work, and schizophrenic rhythmic attacks, all wrapped up in the bow of Greg Puciato's manic vocals and lyrics. Each member's wide range of influences all intertwine with each other as Dillinger add to their growing legacy. From: 'Ultraviolet' Kylesa are an ever-evolving bunch, taking their brand of sludge and melding it with post-metal and psychedelic elements to create something truly their own. 'Unspoken' is a trance-inducing song with rolling rhythms and cosmic texturing that will have you lost in time through its five minute run. This hypnotic dirge takes the band's sound to new places as they shift gears from the typical riff-fest and showcase their diversity. From: 'Queensrÿche' Queensrÿche split into two groups this past year, with this incarnation featuring singer Todd La Torre. The vocalist demonstrates his abilities on 'Where Dreams Go To Die,' taking things from somber to energetic within the song. This track is the first penned by now full-time guitarist Parker Lundgren, as the band is back to being a full on collaboration of all members. There's some obvious bitterness in the lyrics, but they work well outside of the context as a throwback to the glory days of Queensrÿche. From: 'Volition' Protest the Hero have yet another intriguing offering with 'Volition' and continue to grow their unique brand of a melting pot of metallic influences. Overt technicality in the guitar playing opens up 'Drumhead Trial' and somehow manage to work into a more conventional song structure with a traditional metal overtone. Modern metal elements collide with old school sounds in this high-flying and eclectic song. From: 'Aftershock' Motörhead have never disappointed across their 21 studio albums, the latest being 'Aftershock.' The band churns out just what fans wanted, but with a little more edge and attitude than they've had lately. 'Heartbreaker' kicks things off with a bang on 'Aftershock,' instantly showcasing Motörhead's unwavering take on the rock/metal hybrid they've laid down for nearly 40 years. From: 'Sempiternal' Bring Me the Horizon dished out another critically acclaimed album with 'Sempiternal.' The band have expanded their sound and continue to mature as they combine aspects of their early sound with melodic breaks and hardcore riffing. 'Shadow Moses' boasts one of the most anthemic choruses of the year with gang shouts to echo the mindset of the lyrics. Songs like this are the reason Bring Me the Horizon are still on the upswing in their career. From: 'Infestissumam' While Ghost B.C. could have already been considered a breakout band after their debut, 'Opus Eponymous,' they took things to a new level with 'Infestissumam' helping to bring their image to full fruition. 'Year Zero' sees the choirs in full effect as Ghost meld their brand of pop sensibilities with overtly Satanic lyrics and has made converts of countless metal and rock fans. From: 'Colored Sands'  The heat was on Gorguts mainman Luc Lemay after assembling his all-star cast of musicians and resurrected the legendary Gorguts in 2008. Five years after the reformation, 'Colored Sands' was released and exceeded all expectations. 'An Ocean of Wisdom' was the second song to be heard before the album's release and immediately had old fans swooning and new ones lining up in droves to hail their new death metal masters. From: '13' With all of the anticipation of the release of '13' and the pressure on Black Sabbath, 'God Is Dead?' swiftly alleviated any doubts from fans and gave the band a huge sigh of relief. After 35 years between Sabbath albums with Ozzy Osbourne, they delivered what fans have been fantasizing about all of those years. 'God Is Dead?' is a push and pull of heaviness and atmosphere, which embodies what the band was all about from the beginning. Do you agree with the songs on our list?

You can check out our full Top 30 list, but in this Loud List, we count down our Top 10. Always the heroes are Judas Priest, who put out their best album since Painkiller with 2018’s Firepower. Priest’s 18th studio album came close to being our Metal Album of the Year, but “Lightning Strike” was a shoe-in for Metal Song of the Year. Rob Halford’s flawless voice, plus Glenn Tipton’s playing despite his battle with Parkinson’s, are pure gems that gave 2018 metal an extra shine. On Halloween, Slipknot returned from hiatus, surprising fans worldwide with their first new track since 2014. “All Out Life” represents everything the Knot stands for, throwing aside mediocrity and the idea that newer means better. Old does not mean dead, and though Slipknot are far from elders, the 20-year vets reaffirmed their hard-earned place as one of metal’s greatest bands. Let’s stray from the more obvious picks and shine a light on Alien Weaponry — one of metal’s most exciting new prospects. Not since Roots has indigenous music been used so profoundly in metal, and with “Kai Tangata,” Alien Weaponry delivered one of the year’s most addictive tracks.

The character of a singer's voice is extremely difficult to replicate or improve upon, and let's not even get into the complexities of songwriting. However, these 10 vocalists stepped up to the challenge and achieved unbelievable feats. In this list, there are two types of replacement singers present. One type took over when a group was still in relative obscurity, launching the project to new heights after something intangible just clicked. Philip Anselmo replacing Terry Glaze in Pantera and Corey Taylor replacing Anders Colsefni in Slipknot both fall into this category and their contributions simply can't be underestimated. The second, and perhaps most difficult, type took over for established legends and rock gods only to achieve that status themselves. You'll find the usual suspects such as Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson and AC/DC's Brian Johnson on this list, but some of the men featured are sure to surprise you. Two different vocalists who sang for one single iconic act even grabbed Top 10 spots.

29,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-best-rock-songs-2013/,"The best rock songs of 2013 come from a diverse group of artists, with several veteran acts taking the spotlight this year. Bands like Alice in Chains, Korn, AFI and Bad Religion all proved that they're still thriving after 20-plus years in the game. Meanwhile, acts like Avenged Sevenfold and Stone Sour, who've dominated the 2000s, continued to reign in 2013. We had some very tough choices to make in narrowing the standout tunes of 2013 down to a list of the 10 finest, but we feel like these tracks stood out among the rest. Check out our list of the 10 Best Rock Songs of 2013 below: From: 'Earth Rocker' With the title track off their critically acclaimed album 'Earth Rocker,' Clutch deliver a throwback rock anthem. The song features blistering guitars and a monstrous vocal from frontman Neil Fallon. The tune is pure aggression and pure rock 'n' roll from beginning to end. From: 'Connect' Sick Puppies know a thing or two about creating rock radio hits, and 'There's No Going Back' is among the band's most infectious tunes ever. The lead single off their 'Connect' album features a call-and-response chorus that gets stuck in your head upon first listen, making it one of the catchiest hard rock songs of the year. From: 'True North' Bad Religion have been churning out infectious and thought-provoking punk-rock songs for more than 30 years, and the title track off their 2013 album 'True North' is no exception. Despite only clocking in at 2:15, the song packs a punch and features incredibly intriguing lyrics written by frontman Greg Graffin. From 'Hail to the King' Avenged Sevenfold have their share of detractors, but there's a reason they're one of the biggest bands on the hard rock scene. Their latest disc, 'Hail to the King' is an ambitious album that delivers throwback riffs with a modern twist. The epic title track is one of the biggest rock anthems of the year. From: 'The Paradigm Shift' Korn fans were excited when guitarist Brian 'Head' Welch officially rejoined the band in 2013, but little did they know he was working on a new album with the guys for several months. While the band released the radio friendly 'Never Never' as the first single off 'The Paradigm Shift,' it's the track 'Love & Meth' that truly captures the impact of Head's return to the band, as he and Munky deliver some soaring riffs. From: '...Like Clockwork' Six years since the release of their previous album, Queens of the Stone Age returned to both critical acclaim and fan adoration in 2013 with the disc '... Like Clockwork.' While there's a number of standout tracks, the soaring tune 'I Appear Missing' is a perfect example of the beautiful sonic landscapes the band displays throughout the entire album. From: 'Sound City' Soundtrack The stars aligned when Dave Grohl set out to make his 'Sound City' documentary, for which he collaborated with a number of rock luminaries, but none bigger than Paul McCartney. The former Beatle joined forces with the surviving Nirvana members on the track 'Cut Me Some Slack' and the result was nothing short of amazing. From: 'Burials' Fans got their first taste of AFI's new album 'Burials' with the track 'I Hope You Suffer,' and it was immediately clear that singer Davey Havok and company were back in a big way. The musically haunting track features one of the most powerful choruses of any song released in 2013, with Havok spilling his emotional guts into the lyrics. From: 'The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here' Alice in Chains intended 'Hollow' as a preview track off 'The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here' before actually releasing an official first single. However, the song caught on quickly and rose to No. 1 on the rock singles chart -- and deservedly so. The track features Jerry Cantrell and William DuVall harmonizing over a powerful riff that harkens back to AIC's classic sound. From: 'The House of Gold & Bones Part 2' In April of 2013, Stone Sour hit rock fans with 'House of Gold & Bones Part 2,' continuing the triumphant musical story they began telling in 2012 with 'Part 1.' Among the standout tracks on 'Part 2' is 'Do Me a Favor,' a song that combines aggressive verses, an infectious chorus and some incredible musicianship. Corey Taylor & company did rock fans a great big favor releasing this track, which earns the No. 1 spot on our list of the 10 Best Songs of 2013.

We promise it’s almost over, but first, we’re counting down the 10 Best Rock Songs of the year. In the rock world, 2018 was the year of the cover song. You won’t see Weezer’s “Africa” cover on this list, but you will see Bad Wolves’ viral cover of the Cranberries’ “Zombie.” Another killer cover came from Marilyn Manson this year, with his surprise version of the Lost Boys theme, “Cry Little Sister.” After more than a decade of waiting, A Perfect Circle returned with a full album of new music. Eat the Elephant turned out to be a gorgeous album, with “Disillusioned” getting released on January 1. Beyond the song’s sonic beauty, “Disillusioned” is a poignant look at our dependency on technology, which is only going to increase in the coming years. One of the year’s biggest surprises was the rise of Greta Van Fleet. All of a sudden, the cute kids who made Led Zeppelin-esque music became a legitimate phenomenon, releasing Anthem of the Peaceful Army and selling 80,000+ copies in its first week. There were plenty of GVF songs to pick from in 2018, but our choice for this list is the groovy and progressive “Lover, Leaver (Taker, Believer).” Check out our picks for the 10 Best Rock Songs of 2018 in the Loud List above.

31,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-best-rock-videos-2015/,"The music video form is alive and well in 2015. Just take a look at our staff picks for the 10 Best Rock Videos of 2015 to see what we mean. Not only do each of the clips feature great rock songs, but they also use the music video as an art form. You've got some very artistic clips using animation or claymation to tell their story. There's also videos that have a sense of humor or darker dramatic elements that entertain while telling their story. And we've got videos that touch on deeper issues like nuclear war, media bias, profiling in police shootings and juicing in sports. Take a look at our 10 Best Rock Videos of 2015 below. The Darkness kicked off their support of the Last of Our Kind album with the ""Barbarian"" video, an eye-catching clip that told the tale of Edmund the Martyr, cut down by Ivar the Boneless. The animated clip is like a comic book come to life, with its panels delivering the story with visual glory. Loudwire's readers agreed, with the video reaching our Battle Royale Video Countdown Hall of Fame earlier this year. Primus delivered the super sweet ""Candyman"" video late in 2015 and this psychedelic clip, much like the song, takes its influence from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Using claymation, directors Ivan Landau, Edgar Alvarez and Webster Colcord deliver a stunning visual tale, plopping the viewer right down into a candy-filled wonderland. Chris Cornell not only belts a pretty solid tune, but he gets to show off his acting chops, as well. In the ""Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart"" video, the singer is a cowboy, sharing a jail cell with a guitar playing Eric Roberts while they both wait to hang. It's a pretty dire fate awaiting Cornell in this cinematically shot video, but there's a twist in store before Cornell drops from the gallows. Watch and enjoy. Major props go out to Future User's Tim Commerford, who went to great lengths for his art in the ""Mountain Lion"" video. Watch as he skateboards through Los Angeles, shoots up with steroids and later sets himself ablaze in a ""don't-try-this-at-home"" finale. Also, look for disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong making a cameo in the clip. Bring Me the Horizon went the cinematic route, telling a tale that we wish played more of like a TV series than a 7-minute plus video. The ""True Friends"" video centers on a police investigator increasingly haunted by a tragic incidence involving a young woman. Who is playing the mind games? You'll have to watch as it all plays out. The band's own Oli Sykes directed the video, which hinges on the tormented portrayal by actor Steve Oram. Seether offered one of the more thought provoking videos of the year in ""Nobody Praying for Me."" The interactive video allowed viewers to follow the story of a police shooting from the viewpoints of multiple subjects. In total, we see the days of the officer involved, a bystander and the youth of color shot in the incident as well as news reports delivered by media outlets with different slants. In the end, the idea of the Sherif Higazy-directed video was to remind viewers not to rush to judgment based on pre-conceived notions and to fully investigate before rendering a conclusion. Marilyn Manson as a street healer? That's what we get in ""The Mephistopheles of Los Angeles"" video. The stylish video opens with a narration by The Wire and Boardwalk Empire actor Michael K. Williams, setting up the story we're about to see. Manson has his group of disciples. Is he what he appears to be or something more sinister? Watch this visually intriguing clip. Would you like to play a game of thermonuclear war? No, this isn't War Games, but the threat is very real in Avatar's ""Vultures Fly"" video. As we see in this animated clip, a two groups of what appear to be brainwashed workers go about their day, doing as their told. But unfortunately that means sending the world into a nuclear mess as they push the buttons to ensure mutual destruction. This animated video reached the Battle Royale Video Countdown Hall of Fame and recently was voted by Loudwire readers as the Rock Video of the Year. Disturbed made quite the impression upon their return, unleashing their single ""The Vengeful One"" with a powerful and impactful video. Directed by Phil Mucci, the clip finds longtime Disturbed mascot ""The Guy"" riding into town and infiltrating a news network led by robotic newscasters that have been brainwashing the minds of viewers. It's not long before ""The Guy"" issues his brand of mayhem and justice, attempting to break the spell that the viewing world is under. Three words -- clown fight club! Whether you find clowns funny or scary, there's something people can gravitate toward in the Offspring's clever clip for ""Coming for You."" What initially appears to be the typical bungling clowns doing pratfalls for laughs turns into something more sinister as these clowns are out for blood. Bit by bit, the comical battle turns more gruesome and bloody, that is until a mime enters the fray! It's bloody good fun and immediately made a mark upon its debut. The Offspring's ""Coming for You"" is our Top Rock Video of 2015. What is your favorite rock video of 2015? These are our picks. What are yours? Let us know in the Comments section below.

32,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-best-rock-videos-2016/?trackback=tsmclip,"Many bands left their mark with music in 2016, but how many completed their vision with equally as interesting videos? The visual medium can add an extra layer of understanding and appreciation for the song and with our 10 Best Rock Videos of 2016, we're celebrating some of the best offerings. Bands like A Day to Remember, Shinedown, Sum 41 and Puscifer went the more humorous route with their clips. Five Finger Death Punch offered something truly personal for their entry. Disturbed, Avatar, John 5 and The Temperance Movement get points for delivering more artistic visions and Beartooth deliver a surprising narrative that made us stand up and pay attention. Get a look at our picks for the 10 Best Rock Videos of 2016 in the countdown below. Not only is ""White Bear"" a great track from The Temperance Movement, but the band delivered an eye-catching video for the song as well. Director Steven Sebring manipulates time and light with some interesting camera techniques that capture the beauty in movement of a band fully engrossed in their performance. Avatar have always delivered a visual presence with their music and that carried over this year with the geometric wonder that is their ""For the Swarm"" video. The aggressive rocker is accompanied by a visual assault as the band members appear on colorful cubes the fall into formations mirroring the sound of the music. This Johan Carlen-directed clip introduced fans to the band's new album and definitely left its mark. Beware! There's danger ahead in Beartooth's ""Aggressive"" video. The clip is delivered from the viewer's point of view, taking you on a frantic journey that includes the packing of several sharp instruments, rummaging through random drugs, spray painting property, attacks on others, tossing a molotov cocktail and more destructive behavior. But the big reveal is ultimately what sells the clip and makes you question what you just saw. Thumbs up for excellent use of storytelling in this one. Maynard James Keenan has shown a wicked sense of humor and a fascination with pugilism, so we get a bit of both in the Puscifer video for ""The Arsonist."" The animated clip envisions Keenan as an MMA fighter first squaring off against Ronda Rousey, then joining her and fellow fighters Cat Zingarno, Holly Holm and Cristiane ""Cyborg"" Justino as they take down the Trumpzilla that threatens the town. It's a bit of biting commentary right in the midst of election season that definitely landed its punch. So ... much ... pop ... culture! Can Sum 41 escape it? Can anyone? The band has a little fun with the overabundance of trending topics that appear to be chasing down the band's members in their ""Fake My Own Death"" video. Will they escape Kim Kardashian's ""break the Internet"" photo, Angry Birds, Bill Cosby or other destructive forces? Watch and see how many familiar items you can pick out. John 5 and the Creatures encounter some real creatures in their video for ""Making Monsters."" Directors Matt Zane and Johnny Coffin help John 5 with the video, which features a young boy working on some models of creatures, leaving them in his work space and having them suddenly come to life at night. Watch as a mini-John 5 rocks in a ""monster"" band with the Creature from the Black Lagoon and Frankenstein. In one of the funnier videos of the year, Shinedown does not hold back in skewering not only themselves but also the music industry as a whole in their ""Asking for It"" video. The band recruited child actors to play themselves, while the real Shinedown members appear as video crew members. The clip really takes jabs at the band's image and picks apart some of the the thinking in the industry. Overall, it's a fun clip that's well executed by the band and director Darren Doane. And we've got Darren Doane's work back-to-back with the director helping A Day to Remember with another humorous clip, ""Naivety."" The clip centers on the supposed reunion of A Day to Remember, but it comes when each of the members are well into old age. The guys have their fair share of issues, like fighting over Depends and struggling to load gear, not to mention dosing off while driving the van to gigs. But get them onstage, and they can still put on a show like no other. Disturbed's ""The Sound of Silence"" cover was already powerful, but thanks to director Matt Mahurin, it got an equally impressive visual representation. The director uses black and white, light and darkness and shadows all to great effect. And if you were unsure of how much David Draiman connected to the lyric, all you need to do is watch the closeups on the singer's expressive face as he sings. Five Finger Death Punch typically make some sort of mark with their videos, but they may have delivered their most personal clip to date with ""I Apologize."" Singer Ivan Moody's battle with addiction issues have come to light over the past year, and the somber clip for the track addresses that head on. Moody is seen walking through a graveyard with a shovel, passing by a number of familiar names on gravesites -- Joplin, Hendrix, Weiland, Staley, Cobain, Bonham, Morrison and more. Eventually he comes to his own headstone with a born date but no end. As he sits atop a freshly dug grave, he ponders his fate and in the process invites us in to his world. Nathan Cox directed the affecting video, one that moved us while bringing attention to those dealing with various forms of addiction. For the artistic expression and honesty, we salute Five Finger Death Punch's ""I Apologize"" as our Rock Video of the Year. We've shared our favorite rock videos of the year? Now it's time for you to tell us your favorite clips. Head to the Comments section below and share your input.

33,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-best-worst-national-anthem-performances/,"Being invited to perform the National Anthem at any event is an absolute honor. Vocally, it's one of the most daunting tasks with its intimidating rises and falls and the nervous anticipation of a stadium full of people awaiting the high notes. Throughout the decades, some artists have gone on to deliver defining performances of the ""Star Spangled Banner,"" while others floundered, either making mistakes or just flatlining completely with an underwhelming rendition. And that brings us to the purpose of this Loud List. For every incredible, moving performance of the National Anthem, you'll find its ugly counterpart. Let's start off with what's basically unanimously hailed as one of the greatest interpretations of all time: Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. It's one of the most arresting pieces of guitar performance in rock history as he demonstrates authoritative command over his six strings. On the flip side, there was Flea's bass only rendition at a Los Angeles Lakers game that was downright bewildering as fans searched for any trace of a familiar note. We didn't limit this one just to rock and metal as it'd be hard to compile a list of great National Anthem performances without recognizing the show stopping vocal prowess of Whitney Houston. We even went outside of music altogether as you'll see with cringeworthy footage of comedienne Roseanne Barr who should have walked out with a butcher's apron to alert everyone to what was about to go down.

34,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-biggest-rock-metal-stories-2013/,"As 2013 draws to a close, we look back on the many stories, triumphs and tragedies that affected us all this year. We were shocked by some, disgusted by others, inspired by many and even reduced to tears at times. There were many headlines in the worlds of rock and metal in 2013, but these are the stories that made us stop in our tracks. We were hit by some tragic deaths in 2013, including the loss of Slayer's Jeff Hanneman, Deftones' Chi Cheng and former Iron Maiden drummer Clive Burr. Some of rock and metal's biggest names spent a great deal of time in jail and/or court, while others accomplished feats that had never before been done. It's been a mixed bag of the good, bad and the ugly this year, and we count down the 10 Biggest Rock + Metal News Stories of 2013 below: The metal world lost a legend on March 12. Early Iron Maiden drummer Clive Burr died at age 56 due to complications from Multiple Sclerosis. Burr is remembered as one of heavy metal's all-time greatest drummers, having manned the kit for Iron Maiden on their self-titled album, 'Killers' and 'The Number of the Beast.' ""This is terribly sad news,"" said bassist Steve Harris. ""Clive was a very old friend of all of us. He was a wonderful person and an amazing drummer who made a valuable contribution to Maiden in the early days when we were starting out."" Metallica took some incredible chances this year while planting landmarks along the way. Apart from hosting the second edition of the band's Orion Music + More Festival and releasing the 3D concert film 'Metallica: Through the Never,' Metallica also accomplished a feat never attempted before by their contemporaries. In 2013, Metallica became the first band to ever perform in all seven continents in one year, finishing the checklist with their 'Freeze 'Em All' gig in Antarctica in early December. Deftones bassist Chi Cheng passed away this year from complications due to injuries suffered in a 2008 car crash. Chi, who was mostly in a coma since the accident, had begun to show some responsive signs last year. Although Chi was going in and out of the hospital, Deftones fans remained optimistic about the bassist's eventual recovery, but Chi died on April 13 after his heart suddenly stopped beating. ""He left this world with me singing songs he liked in his ear,"" Chi's mother wrote. ""He fought the good fight. You stood by him sending love daily. He knew that he was very loved and never alone."" 2013 was a truly triumphant year for Black Sabbath. Along with releasing their long-awaited '13' album, the metal legends did some intense touring, including a North American run originally scrapped due to Bill Ward's contract issues and Tony Iommi's cancer diagnosis. When '13' was released in June, it became the first Black Sabbath album in the band's history to hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts. '13' also topped the German, Canadian, Danish and U.K. album charts, among others, as Iommi continued to courageously battle his lymphoma while performing around the world. Motorhead frontman Lemmy Kilmister scared us a bit this year with various health issues, but the iconic rocker has since pulled through. This year alone, Kilmister had an implantable defibrillator put into his chest, suffered from a hematoma, and was forced to leave the stage at Wacken after feeling faint. Lemmy went on to chalk it up as ""paying for the good times."" Regardless, Motorhead put out an awesome album this year in the form of 'Aftershock.' On Dec. 12, Slipknot released some shocking news. After 18 years with the band, drummer Joey Jordison parted ways with the pinnacle metal act. Slipknot has always been an incredibly tight unit, with all members becoming one creature the second they hit the stage. The brotherhood seemed unbreakable, so Jordison's departure was truly unpredictable. ""It is with great pain but quiet respect that, for personal reasons, Joey Jordison and Slipknot are parting ways,"" reads an official statement from the band. We all wish Joey the best in whatever his future holds."" This year, Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins was convicted of the most disturbing crimes in rock history. On Nov. 26, Watkins pleaded guilty to a total of 11 charges including two counts of attempted rape and a count of sexual assault of a child under 13. One of the children in question was less than a year old. Additionally, Watkins admitted to three counts of sexual assault involving children; six counts of taking, making and possessing indecent images of children; and one act of possessing an extreme pornographic image involving a sex act on an animal. Lamb of God vocalist Randy Blythe displayed tremendous courage and honor by returning to the Czech Republic to stand trial for manslaughter. Blythe was back in the U.S. before the trial and was advised by many not to return to the Czech Republic, but even though many cried corruption, Blythe faced the music and was ultimately given a ""not guilty"" verdict. Although Blythe wanted to clear his name, the vocalist also chose to stand trial to give the deceased Lamb of God fan's family the same sense of justice. This was a truly shocking story from 2013. As I Lay Dying vocalist Tim Lambesis was arrested on May 7 on charges of attempting to hire a hitman to murder the singer's estranged wife, Meggan. Tim Lambesis shares three adopted kids with Meggan, having adopted the children from Ethiopia. Divorce papers showed concern from Meggan Lambesis about Tim's behavior, and the As I Lay Dying frontman's lawyer would go on to blame steroid use for devastatingly affecting his thought processes. As of this posting, Tim Lambesis' trial is tentatively set to begin in early 2014. On May 2, the tragic news of Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman's death was made public. The iconic shredder died from liver failure, but Hanneman had also been suffering from necrotizing fasciitis since 2011, taking him off the road and decreasing the man's quality of life. The man who composed thrash masterpieces such as 'Raining Blood,' 'Angel of Death,' 'War Ensemble' and many others left us way too early, leaving metalheads worldwide with tears in their eyes. Which story do you think is the biggest of 2013? If we missed one, post about it in the comments section below.

36,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-brushes-with-death-watch/,"Rockers have always been drawn to a dangerous lifestyle whether it be on or offstage. Risky behavior and freak accidents have almost taken some of our most beloved musicians, but luckily, they escaped these brushes with death. Has any living rock star had more brushes with death than Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx? During his days as a raging addict, Sixx overdosed a total of… you guessed it… six times. In this video you’ll hear the story behind his most famous overdose, where the bassist actually flatlined for two minutes. Thanks to a metalhead EMT, however, two shots of adrenaline to Sixx’s heart kept the bassist from going into the light. Heavy drinking almost put Guns N’ Roses bassist Duff McKagan out of commission after his developed extreme pancreatitis from years of alcohol abuse. It almost killed McKagan and left the man with internal third-degree burns. Let’s get into the freak accidents you’ll find in this Loud List. KISS legend Ace Frehley had a legendary encounter with 220 volts of electricity onstage. Even more frightening could be Metallica frontman James Hetfield’s accidental near-evisceration. Flaming magnesium which fueled Metallica’s pyro at the time caught Hetfield, who suffered ridiculous burns because of the mister.

37,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-castle-metal-albums-you-need-to-hear/,"Right about now you may be asking yourself: what the heck is Castle Metal, anyway? Well, fear not, because you’re not the first heavy metal adventurer to beg the answer to that mystical query, but suffice to say that Castle Metal refers to heavy music bearing lyrics about ancient days, both historical (i.e. the Middle Ages, or thereabouts) and legendary (e.g. packed with dragons, wizards, kings and queens). Since the earliest days of Black Sabbath, heavy metal has provided fans with an escape from their dreary life’s routines; but not until the launch of Ritchie Blackmore’s Rainbow did the style we celebrate today really come into focus start taking shape, slowly gaining other champions as the ‘70s drew to a close. Then, with the arrival of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, fantasy themes started to dominate many bands' repertoires, including those of Iron Maiden, Saxon, Angel Witch and many more. Former Rainbow singer Ronnie James Dio, too, continued to wield his Castle Metal sword, first with Sabbath and then his own band (it should go without saying that you should already own all of those early Dio LPs), even as he added real world subjects into the mix. Yet, for Rainbow’s battalions of 1980s disciples (and beyond), many of whom found parallel entertainment in the massively popular role playing game of Dungeons and Dragons, fantasy realms were all they knew, or cared to sing about, and it’s these groups that wound up dominating our gallery of the 10 Castle Metal Albums You Need to Hear.

There are countless people who've suffered the same issue, and these 10 songs are some of the most likely reasons. Many metal songs stand the test of time due to how catchy they are. As modern metal gets heavier and more complex with polished production, new music can become more inviting than the gems of old. However, there's no substitute for a well-written track that's infectious in nature. Vocal lines will bounce around in your skull for days. How many times have you walked down the street humming along to the chorus of Judas Priest's ""Living After Midnight"" or Iron Maiden's ""Run to the Hills""? A massive riff can hold the same power. Randy Rhoads' immortal work with Ozzy Osbourne is perhaps most celebrated in ""Crazy Train,"" one of metal's greatest riffs of all time. Big leads like Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"" and Pantera's ""Walk"" helped get mainstream airplay for bands that otherwise may have been considered too heavy for public consumption.

In these 10 cases, many critics or even the majority of critics panned a record which went on to become an universally acclaimed classic. Historically, the moments that divide professional critics come when a massive shift in the sonic landscape appears. In 1970, that shift arrived with Black Sabbath’s debut album, signaling the arrival of heavy metal. Many critics didn’t get the group’s sound, with Rolling Stone calling Sabbath “just like Cream, but worse” and veteran critic Robert Christgau dubbing Black Sabbath “the worst of the counterculture on a plastic platter.” It’s hard to believe these days, but critics used to love beating up on Queen… not just for one album, either. During Queen’s ascent to legitimate rock gods, Rolling Stone never quite understood the operatic rockers, giving the band’s Jazz album a brutal review: “Makes me wonder why anyone would indulge these creeps and their polluting ideas.” The Chicago Tribune also gave Jazz a 1.5/5 rating, while the Village Voice bestowed a C+ upon on record. Apparently, “Fat Bottomed Girls,” “Bicycle Race” and “Don’t Stop Me Now” just didn’t exude that star quality. AC/DC are one of the world’s greatest examples of a pure rock ’n’ roll band, but their style wasn’t entirely welcomed once they made their way over to the U.S. In a now infamous Rolling Stone article, High Voltage was called “calculated stupidity” and the “all-time low” of hard rock. Thankfully, the public heard “It’s a Long Way to the Top,” “The Jack” and “T.N.T.” and begged to differ.

Iron Maiden may be the most consistent metal band of all time, only delivering true duds during the Blaze Bayley era. Since Bruce Dickinson’s comeback at the turn of the millennium, Maiden have released more incredible albums than almost anyone in the 21st century, with legitimate all-timers in Brave New World and The Book of Souls. One of the greatest comebacks in rock history belongs to Alice in Chains. With the legendary Layne Staley long gone from drug addiction, the Seattle alt icons chose to move forward with new singer William DuVall, stunning fans with the excellent Black Gives Way to Blue and The Devil Put Dinosaurs here. With Jerry Cantrell leading the charge, Alice in Chains will launch Rainier Fog this year, and if its singles are any indication, the album will rip. When it comes to punk, no band has a resume like Bad Religion. Ignoring the disastrous Into the Unknown, Bad Religion’s four-decade discography is spotless, releasing some of the 21st century’s catchiest music.

A rule we set for this list is that all the ‘“classic” members of the band currently have to be alive, which is sadly why you won’t see Pantera and Led Zeppelin here. Also, the bands have to be completely inactive, so we didn’t include Smashing Pumpkins or Skid Row here, since those bands are still active despite missing classic members. Perhaps the most obvious act to mention is Rage Against the Machine. Though fans are getting their fill with Prophets of Rage, the addition of Zack de la Rocha on the mic makes for a completely different animal. The small number of reunion shows since RATM’s breakup in 2000 have felt like worldwide celebrations and if the original four of Rage ever decided to reform, they’d surely be able to fill stadiums with loyal fans. It’s hard to believe the White Stripes have been broken up since 2011, but during their rise in the 2000s, the Stripes were one of the few bands who injected new life into rock and roll. Tracks like “Seven Nation Army” and “Icky Thump” brought a classic rock sensibility into the mainstream, reintroducing the world to the power one man can have behind a guitar. We still miss the metronomic drumming of Meg White backing up bandmate Jack White, so we’re certain a reunion would be gigantic.

While Jay is the star of this Loud List, there are plenty of other memorable characters you’ll meet. At a Misfits show, a shirtless dude invaded the punk band’s stage, evading three security guards before diving back into the crowd. As those same guards caught a different stage crasher, our shirtless friend got back onstage and treated fans to some drunken breakdancing. Of course, we had to include the infamous onstage fight between a pre-Nevermind Nirvana and a wasted fan. With a drink in one hand and a microphone in the other, the sunglasses-and-fisherman’s-hat clad man shouted more incoherently than Kurt Cobain and sloppily fell into various Nirvana members. He lasted a long time onstage, but was eventually thrown off by the band. Switching gears, a heartwarming moment between Chester Bennington and a fan is featured in this list. During the period when Chester fronted Stone Temple Pilots, he embraced a highly intoxicated stage crasher with tribal tattoos, singing along with the long-haired lush.

We rounded up some of your favorite acts’ first shows ever for this Loud List. When Corey Taylor joined Slipknot, he didn’t even wear a mask for this inaugural gig. The powerhouse frontman did have some makeup around his eyes and what looks like a suit jacket, so there aren’t many recognizable CMFT elements in this Slipknot show, which took place at the Safari Club on Aug. 24, 1997. Of course, the Ramones played their first show at CBGB’s in New York City. The future punk legends didn’t get a very favorable reception, likely due to the almost nonexistent crowd. Joey Ramone was a much different performer back then, doing his best New York Dolls act. The Ramones even had an onstage fight over what songs to play during their first gig, resulting in a yelling match that’s forever captured on film. Unlike most bands during their first performance, Rage Against the Machine were immediately incredible. Zack de la Rocha had a pro’s command of the stage, while the instrumental section remained crazy tight the entire show. No wonder RATM’s rise seemed to happen overnight.

If you haven’t seen ‘Worst Band Ever Butchers Pink Floyd,’ you haven’t spent nearly enough time on YouTube. In what’s become a legendary clip, a group of middle-aged men gathered in front of a music store to entertain the locals. Performing Pink Floyd’s “Comfortably Numb,” the band was completely out of time, and frankly, didn’t seem to know the song at all. The destruction of David Gilmour’s iconic guitar solo is especially egregious… and we hope this gentleman was forever banned from playing Floyd, even in private. If the creators of South Park skewered Avenged Sevenfold like they did Dio, it would sound exactly like one of the bands in this list. This cover of “Unholy Confessions” is pretty terrible, but you’ve gotta give these young men credit for keeping the energy up. Sometimes you’ve gotta fake it ’til you make it, and if you’re having a blast onstage, you’re already coming out a winner. Speaking of Dio, one of the funniest entries in this list is a complete “Holy Diver” disaster. This heavy metal duo couldn’t even get past the main riff, unable to line up the guitar and drum parts.

Whether it's the most the most mainstream music to the most left-field metal, nearly every rock-related artist is inspired by the John, Paul, George and Ringo. For instance: when the Fab Four released “Twist and Shout,” it was the blueprint for what would become hard rock. With John Lennon utilizing a harsh vocal style, Ringo Starr annihilating his drum kit and the entire band roaring through the cut at what was then a lightning-fast pace, the Beatles conjured a kind of energy never seen or heard before. Going from a cheesy pop-rock band to progressive giants, the Beatles brought experimental music to the masses with Rubber Soul and Revolver. The latter was especially artistic with tracks like “Eleanor Rigby,” “Yellow Submarine” and “Tomorrow Never Knows” expanding the borders of popular music. Later into the Beatles’ career, they became one of the heaviest bands to pre-date the metal genre. Though heavy metal and doom metal are both attributed to Black Sabbath, the Beatles wrote what could be considered the first proto-metal song with “Helter Skelter.” Those grooves don’t lie. Furthermore, the group laid the foundation for doom with “I Want You (She’s So Heavy).” The final three-minute guitar line in “I Want You” was pure Iommi before Iommi was Iommi… and you can quote us on that.

How many bands have released one album just to dissolve almost immediately after? And how many acts are willing to walk away from fame after suddenly exploding with their debut? The Sex Pistols may be the ultimate example of band who only needed one album to establish a brilliant legacy. Never Mind the Bullocks launched the underground movement of punk rock into the mainstream while simultaneously moving the genre into its most rebellious form. Despite both fame and infamy, the Sex Pistols called it quits after a disastrous U.S. tour. Sadly, death is also to blame for halting a group’s momentum. Mother Love Bone seemed destined for mainstream success, but a heroin overdose from frontman Andrew Wood ended Mother Love Bone even before the band’s debut, Apple, even hit shelves. Hardcore punk legends The Germs fell to a similar fate after vocalist Darby Crash’s suicide at age 22 ended the band’s run. Death also touched bands like Heaven & Hell, Control Denied and Mad Season.

It’s one of the rarest feats in music, especially if an act has been around for decades. But believe it or not, there are 10 amazing bands that have remained intact since day one. The most impressive streak in this list belongs to Radiohead. Since forming in 1985, the exact same lineup has performed on each album and at each live show. Most marriages don’t last 32 years, let alone a creative partnership between five dudes. You’ve got to give Radiohead credit, as they’ve pulled it off remarkably well. Rammstein also stand out as a rarity in music. Since 1994, the six-man industrial juggernaut has remained structurally sound. The members of Rammstein cite group therapy as a major reason why they’re all still working together, with guitarist Richard Kruspe even claiming that if one bandmate leaves Rammstein, the German metallers will be finished. Sadly, some of these bands chose to call it quits instead of search for another member. In the case of Rage Against the Machine, they functioned at an iconic level from 1991-2000 before Zack de la Rocha walked away.

The departure of Ozzy Osbourne from Black Sabbath in 1979 set the stage for two incredible comebacks. After a few years of internal strife with Ozzy and a couple of lackluster albums, Black Sabbath seemed to be fizzling out, until Ronnie James Dio came on board. Breathing new life into Sabbath, Dio committed his vocals to the modern classics Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules. Ozzy also came roaring back after being fired, beginning metal’s greatest solo career with Randy Rhoads on guitar. When Bruce Dickinson left Iron Maiden in 1993, the band officially entered its dark age. With guitarist Adrian Smith already gone, Maiden was stripped to its core, releasing two underwhelming albums with Blaze Bayley on vocals. Iron Maiden were basically playing clubs at that point, but Dickinson and Smith’s 1999 return put Maiden back in arenas. 2000’s Brave New World turned out to be Maiden’s finest effort in over a decade, kicking off a second Renaissance for the iconic band. After the phenomenal Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Red Hot Chili Peppers essentially crapped the bed with its follow up, One Hot Minute. The difference? Dave Navarro replacing John Frusciante on guitar, so when Frusciante finally returned for Californication, he helped RHCP become the biggest band in the world.

Just see how many rock, metal and even pop acts have covered the Birmingham blueprinters’ music. To many metalheads, “Black Sabbath” is the heaviest song ever written. Tony Iommi’s use of the tritone is often seen as the launching point for heavy metal as a genre, crafting “Black Sabbath” as one of the most distressing tracks ever. Fellow doom act Type O Negative embraced covering “Black Sabbath” as the ultimate challenge — make the heaviest song even heavier. It’s certainly creepy and Peter Steele is the only vocalist who could do the cover justice. Melvins are one of rock’s finest ambassadors of the almighty riff, thanks in part to the influence of Tony Iommi. The sludge merchants took one of Iommi’s best riffs, “Into the Void,” and put their own spin on the cut. If a Black Sabbath track is ever going to be in good hands, Buzz Osborne is the man to trust.

The extreme metal band has taken a few dynamics from Slayer, notably the use of speed and infernal sonic landscapes, and it shows in this cover. Dani Filth maintains a rapid-fire delivery with his trademark guttural, while CoF’s instrumental section lays down Slayer’s parts at a ripping pace. Perhaps the most famous Slayer cover is Vader’s version of “Raining Blood.” The song has been a staple of Vader’s live show since the late ‘90s, being featured prominently on Live in Japan and Night of the Apocalypse. Piotr Wiwczarek’s distinguished guttural vocals add another uncomfortable layer to “Raining Blood,” adding another hazardous edge to the immortal song. We need to talk about Tori Amos for a second. The singer-songwriter launched into an experiment called Strange Little Girls in 2001, where she covered songs originally sung by men. Track 11 is a piano rendition of “Raining Blood,” performed at a snail’s pace. It’s a beautiful cover, but Amos’ approach is also uncomfortable — a feeling Slayer fans are all too comfortable with.

Chuck wasn’t just amazing at writing riffs, but setting them up with crushing preludes. You can hear this best on “The Philosopher” as Schuldiner’s tapping beautifully introduces that crushing palm-muted chord progression. Another masterful use of chords to set a tone can be heard on “Crystal Mountain,” which also makes an appearance in this list. Some of Schuldiner’s most masterful work is rooted in complexity. One of Chuck’s most inventive riffs comes in the form of “Flesh and the Power It Holds.” It’s as catchy as it is technically proficient, standing out as one of the most memorable pieces on The Sound of Perseverance.

Decades later, songs like “Stand Up and Shout,” “Rainbow in the Dark,” “Don’t Talk to Strangers” and “Holy Diver” are among the most beloved heavy metal cuts of all time. Rap and metal together as one genre? Hell no! At least not until Rage Against the Machine came along and melded those worlds together with undeniable power. Suddenly, a band existed that appealed to metalheads, punks, hip-hop fans and just about everyone else. There’s not one weak track on Rage Against the Machine, instead filled to the brim with political protest anthems. Forget ""best debut of all time,"" Guns N’ Roses’ Appetite for Destruction is the best album of the 1980s, at least in our estimation.

You sit in silence wondering why it doesn’t just stop, but the seconds keep ticking by. Suddenly, something you’ve never heard before blasts into your ears! It’s the almighty hidden track, and these are our picks for the 10 greatest ones in rock and metal history. It’s hard to believe that The Clash’s “Train in Vain” was actually a hidden track on London Calling, especially since it’s now one of their most famous cuts. Actually, it wasn’t supposed to be hidden, but The Clash submitted “Train in Vain” after the London Calling sleeve had already been printed. The song’s memorable chorus has been put into TV shows, movies and skate videos, so chance are you’ll recognize “Train in Vain” even if the title doesn’t ring any bells. Ever “slide a mile six inches at a time on Maynard’s dick”? Any Tool fan who’s made it to the end of Salival has. The now out-of-print box set spans 74 minutes, the final four of which belong to “Maynard’s Dick.” Like much of Tool’s work, “Maynard’s Dick” has become a cult favorite with fans, and it’s genuinely a great track. Hidden tracks often feature the bizarre and unexpected, which can be said about Green Day’s “All By Myself.” Pop punk is a haven for humor, and “All By Myself” is drummer Tre Cool’s tribute to masturbation. Taking center stage for the track, Tre Cool even describes breaking into someone’s home and whacking it in their room, but not in so many words.

Check out our Top 10 picks for the Greatest Iron Maiden Riffs right here. Want to be transported to NWOBHM heaven? Just pop a copy of Powerslave on your record player. Starting the album strong, Iron Maiden launch right into “Aces High,” rolling, turning and diving with one of heavy metal’s strongest leads. Dive deeper into Powerslave and you’ll find the Egyptian-inspired title track along with perhaps Maiden’s greatest epic ever, “Rime of the Ancient Mariner.” Fear of the Dark has been seen as a low point in Iron Maiden’s discography, marking the final album from Bruce Dickinson before his return a decade later. However, may we be so bold as to include not one, but TWO, riffs from the album on our list? Oh, we did it! The album’s title track is one obvious inclusion, but can you guess the second entry from Fear of the Dark? We showed plenty of love to Iron Maiden’s Paul Di’Anno era, as well. One of Maiden’s most daring riffs came from the very first album. Of course, we’re talking about “Phantom of the Opera.” Its a bizarrely timed riff, especially when paired with Di’Anno’s vocal part. We also threw Iron Maiden’s eponymous concert staple in the mix, because how can you pass up that sick riff?

The Metal Gods have written some of their genre’s finest riffs, so we’ve compiled our picks for the 10 Greatest Judas Priest Riffs. Has there ever been a more epic intro to an album than “The Hellion / Electric Eye”? The two opening tracks, which flow together seamlessly, solidified Screaming for Vengeance as a classic album even before Rob Halford sang his first note. The structure of “Electric Eye” became the blueprint for countless future metal riffs where bands would loop around the same lick with a slight change in each measure. All these years later, it still rips harder than most metal bands could even imagine measuring up against. Judas Priest’s commercial breakout, British Steel, is an absolute riff fest. Pounding the world like a battering ram, British Steel helped usher in the ‘80s, giving us immortal riffs like “Breaking the Law” and “Living After Midnight” while keeping it heavy with cuts like “Grinder.” However, only one riff made it on our list. Can you guess the chosen one? Though Point of Entry was a little too “rock” for the metalheads out there, one undeniably phenomenal track is “Desert Plains.” Beyond Halford’s soaring vocals, the cut features a lead riff that’s beefy as it is melodic, and it’s a classic example of what Priest can do better than any other band.

The male/female vocal dynamic has endlessly enriched the world of metal, especially when it comes to the genre’s symphonic side. One of metal’s most dynamic vocal duos is Simone Simons and Mark Jansen of Epica. With Jensen’s growls and Simons’ operatic jumps, Epica are able to depict drama at every turn. One of the most underrated duos conspired to bring sonic self-care into modern metal. Devin Townsend and Anneke van Giersbergen created gorgeous music together for 10 years in The Devin Townsend Project. Perhaps the duo’s best work can be found on the lush Epicloud record, one of Townsend’s most awe-inspiring albums. Of course, this list couldn’t be complete without the classic Nightwish lineup. The team of Tarja Turunen and Marco Hietala sung measures of magic together on the Century Child and Once albums, allowing Nightwish to become Finland’s biggest band. Marco has since recorded excellent albums with Anette Olzon and Floor Jansen, but the Tarja era is still considered the golden age.

It’s our list of the 10 Greatest Masked Rock + Metal Acts! For this list, we decided to choose entire bands or one-person acts who wear actual masks instead of just face paint, so you won’t find iconic acts like KISS and King Diamond here. Rock and metal has a rich history of theatrics where a visual element brings added depth to a musical concept. Some musicians don’t just obscure their faces, they transform head-to-toe into legitimate monsters. GWAR is the most famous example, portraying intergalactic warmongers who “kill” famous humans onstage and squirt horrendous fluids into the crowd. Lordi is another example of monster rock, making history by winning the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest. When you think of metal, Australia may not be a country that immediately comes to mind, but the Aussies have produced perhaps the two greatest masked extreme metal bands in history: Portal and The Berzerker. Both bands were way ahead of the curve musically, testing the limits of where extreme metal could go. Of course, the modern metal landscape would look drastically different without Slipknot, the psychotic masked nine who put on one of music’s greatest live spectacles.

These are the greatest metal albums ever made… period. Call us Ozzy fanboys, but the iconic singer makes three appearances in this list for good reason. With Black Sabbath, Ozzy’s tortured vocals helped birth the first form of heavy metal. For our money, Paranoid and Master of Reality are the two most essential Sabbath albums, both making this Top 10. As for Ozzy’s solo career, his introduction to guitar god Randy Rhoads gave us another all-timer with Blizzard of Ozz. No Top 10 is complete without Iron Maiden’s first record with Bruce Dickinson, The Number of the Beast. Beginning their transition from raw metallers to epic storytellers, Iron Maiden became the Beethovens of NWOBHM with cuts like “Hallowed Be Thy Name” and “Children of the Damned.” Of course, “Run to the Hills” and “The Number of the Beast” became timeless classics as well. Perhaps it’s a bold claim, but we threw Tool’s 2001 magnum opus, Lateralus, on our list. We’ve previously named Lateralus the greatest album of the 21st century so far, bringing Tool’s spiritual and philosophical dynamics to its zenith. Fans use the messages within Lateralus as their personal compass, and that’s an achievement that few bands can claim.

You’ll find some of the most masterful concept albums on this list, including two that are considered perfect: Queensryche’s Operation: Mindcrime and King Diamond’s Abigail. Throughout the decades, both records have remained as the benchmark for all concept albums, challenging any modern band to tell a story with the same tact.

62,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-greatest-metal-riffs-1980s/,"The 1980s was riff heaven for metalheads. With the advent of thrash and the New Wave of British Heavy Metal further advancing to metal’s forefront, a golden age of music ruled the decade. Though Metallica are undoubtedly thrash’s most prominent band, there was no greater thrash riff master than Slayer’s Jeff Hanneman. The Slayer shredder penned dozens of iconic riffs, perhaps none more celebrated than “Raining Blood.” Three decades later, it remains one of thrash’s heaviest and most distressing riffs, as if it was handed to Hanneman by the dark lord himself. Iron Maiden and Judas Priest both released their most celebrated works in the 1980s, both going the whole decade without a true dud in their respective catalogues. Priest entered the ‘80s with pure metal strength immediately with British Steel, giving us an incredible riff on “Breaking the Law.” Maiden’s standout ‘80s riff is arguably “The Trooper” from 1983’s Piece of Mind and it’s truly a song Maiden fan can hear every single tour without getting tired of the incredible guitar attack. Ozzy Osbourne may have been booted from Black Sabbath, but he wasn’t done working with heavyweight riff lords. Recruiting guitar phenom Randy Rhoads, Ozzy struck back with “Crazy Train.” Who would have thought that after Tony Iommi's godlike collection of riffs from the ‘70s that Ozzy Osbourne’s fresh-faced guitarist would pen a riff that outdid any of Iommi’s work in the ‘80s?

However, you wouldn’t know it by checking out the 10 Greatest Metal Riffs of the 1990s. The king of metal riffs in the 1990s was the iconic Dimebag Darrell Abbott. Throughout Pantera’s dominance in the ‘90s, Dimebag compiled one of the strongest catalogues of riffs in metal history. Chunky cuts like “I’m Broken” and “Cowboys From Hell” defined the decade, but arguably no riff had more staying power than “Walk.” Just two chords and a bend… that’s all it took to compose one of metal’s most punishing riffs. Though metal in the mainstream wasn’t huge in the ‘90s, the extreme underground was as healthy as its ever been. Cannibal Corpse ruled over brutal death metal throughout the decade, giving us the unrelenting “Hammer Smashed Face.” Across the pond, Carcass experienced their definitive years as well, offering a killer riff with “Corporal Jigsore Quandary.” The golden age of thrash took place in the ‘80s, but Megadeth remained exceptional in the early ‘90s. After all, it’s when they unleashed their magnum opus, “Holy Wars… the Punishment Due.” Another riff that thrives off simplicity, it never fails to get fans moving in the pit.

For this Loud List, we explore 1990-1999 to prove the dreaded decade wasn’t so bad for metal after all. The undisputed kings of metal in the ‘90s were Pantera. Releasing classic after classic throughout the decade, it’s no surprise to see the Cowboys From Hell take multiple spots on this list. A cut from Vulgar Display of Power was chosen for 1992, but it’s not the song you’re thinking of. You’ll also find a riff-tastic track from Far Beyond Driven featured for 1994. The ‘90s was a period when alternative metal really took off in the mainstream too. Tool turned from a promising young band to a legitimate cult with Ænima, and the Bill Hicks-inspired almost-title track was as powerful as Tool’s desire to see Los Angeles sink into the Pacific Ocean. The decade also saw the birth of nu-metal, with Korn leading the charge. The Bakersfield band hit their high watermark in 1998 with Follow the Leader and its most powerful single, “Freak on a Leash.” During an era when boy bands were topping the charts on TRL, “Freak on a Leash” famously knocked them off the top spot, waving a triumphant black flag for metal.

In this video, we run through 2000-2009 and choose the single metal cut that reigns supreme for every year. Following the groove and nu-metal wave that delivered metal through the ‘90s, progressive music suddenly exploded at the turn of the millennium. Though Tool experienced much success in the ‘90s, they really became a cult in the early 2000s with Lateralus. They followed the gigantic album with 10,000 Days, which further indoctrinated fans with the word of Maynard. Extreme music got more extreme in the 2000s, especially thanks to bands like Meshuggah. No band crushes with blistering technicality quite like the Swedish djent titans. You’ll find two ‘Shuggah tracks in this Loud List, representing the Nothing and obZen albums. Opeth also grab a prominent position in this video with one of their most brutal and sophisticated songs. When discussing 21st century metal, Mastodon should always be one of the first names flying out of your mouth. Having released four damn-near-perfect albums in the 2000s, Mastodon slowly became underground metal’s most admired and accomplished act of the decade.

In this video, we salute the bands that are so metal they had to write about metal itself. Corny? Damn right it is! Sammy Hagar’s classic “Heavy Metal” track is a boot-scootin’ shoulder shaker and it totally rules through its unapologetic originality. Exactly like Hagar lives his life, “Heavy Metal” is a total party and its inclusion in a South Park episode exposed a new generation of fans to the Red Rocker’s cut. If any band has earned the right to pen tracks about heavy metal, it’s Manowar. The Kings of Metal have been scripting scenes of war and steel for nearly four decades, often dressing like Hercules posing for Playgirl magazine. Manowar have written plenty of tracks about their beloved genre, but we chose “Die for Metal” to represent their body of work for this list. “They can’t stop us / Let ‘em try / For heavy metal / We would die!” High up on this list, we had to include Venom’s signature piece that defined an entire genre, “Black Metal.” Beyond how simply awesome the song is, “Black Metal” is like a course in Metal 101.

With years and even decades having passed since these albums changed the metal landscape, there have been outliers we were shocked to learn had never seen a live audience. When Pantera unleashed Vulgar Display of Power, it was only the second album representing their new sound. With such a monumental album raising the Texans to the status of metal gods, you assume they’d bust out all 11 tracks at some point, right? Nope! There’s one song Pantera never took to the stage — “Regular People.” Exactly why is a mystery, especially since “Regular People” is far from a low point on the remarkably consistent Vulgar Display of Power. Iron Maiden’s Powerslave is one of the iconic metal band’s most beloved and commercially successful albums. Just eight tracks long, a single Powerslave track has been excluded from Maiden’s sets for nearly 35 years — “Back in the Village.” Even the instrumental “Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) ” has been played dozens of times! Meshuggah is the most powerful rhythm machine on the planet, devastating fans with intricate and wildly technical extreme metal.

The Pittsburg act introduced the world to their third studio album, Forever, just 13 days into the new year and it struck all the right chords with fans. The album’s title track is a pummeling work that straddles the line between gratifying and nightmarish. It’s also been wildly successful for Code Orange, getting 1.6 million streams on YouTube alone.

Our first list starts when it all began… the 1970s. With Loudwire’s staff all weighing in with their opinions, we settled on the best song of each year from 1970-1979. In the early ‘70s, heavy metal was just emerging out of the primordial ooze. Only a few bands really embodied the metal style, with Black Sabbath at the forefront. Choosing Black Sabbath to represent various years wasn’t a tough decision at all, but selecting a single song was brutal. After all, the Black Sabbath and Paranoid albums were both released in 1970… so which precious jewel do you keep if you can only have one? You’ll find classics from the almighty Judas Priest throughout this list, starting with “Victim of Changes.” As Priest continued to develop into the ultimate heavy metal band, their songs became rip-roaring masterworks clad in leather and studs, so we had to select yet another track to honor their contributions. You’ll find two entries from Ritchie Blackmore in this list with two different bands. From Deep Purple to Rainbow, Blackmore’s guitar work and songwriting was revolutionary in metal’s early years. Arguably no guitarist in history has gotten to work with more incredible singers than Blackmore.

In this list, we narrowed the decade down to find the best song of each year from 1980-1989. You can’t talk about ‘80s music without mentioning Metallica. The rise of the Bay Area thrashers has still never been matched in metal, and their best work came throughout the ‘80s. With four landmark albums released in a five-year period, it was obvious Metallica had to represent multiple years, so you’ll see the icons entered twice in this list. 1980 was when Iron Maiden took hold of the Union Jack and led the charge for the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. It was essentially a perfect decade for the band, whether Paul Di’Anno or Bruce Dickinson was on the mic. Both singers actually make appearances on this list, so get ready for two eras of Maiden. The ‘80s also saw the birth of death metal. The Godfather of Death Metal, Chuck Schuldiner, began his untouchable career in the late 1980s, penning classics like “Zombie Ritual” in 1987. Morbid Angel would bring death metal into a more extreme and blasphemous realm with 1989’s Altars of Madness and its standout track, “Chapel of Ghouls.” Check out our picks for the 10 Greatest Metal Songs of the 1980s (Year by Year) in the Loud List above.

The four-stringer shares writing credits on legendary cuts like ‘Master of Puppets” and boasts the sole writing credit for “(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth.” Burton’s masterpiece, however, may be “For Whom the Bell Tolls.” Along with being one of Metallica’s most memorable riffs, Burton brought his bass to the forefront of an iconic song, leading the powerhouse track with his haunting tone and unapologetic distortion. As for Mustaine and Hammett, you’ll hear plenty from them.

72,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-greatest-neoclassical-guitarists/,"Much of rock and metal’s roots can be easily traced back to classical music. These guitarists made that well known while ushering in a unique style of heavy guitar playing. These are our picks for the 10 Greatest Neoclassical Guitarists! Make no mistake, you don’t need to be in a neoclassical band to be a neoclassical guitarist. Neither Deep Purple nor Rainbow are true neoclassical bands, but guitar legend Ritchie Blackmore is well-known as a pioneer of the neoclassical style. Heavily influenced by Bach, Mozart and others, Blackmore utilized diminished sevenths and switching between pentatonic scales to help develop the style, which would later be refined by musicians like Yngwie Malmsteen. Yngwie has risen to become the king of neoclassic guitarists. His debut solo album, Rising Force, marked a shift in what a heavy metal guitarist could accomplish. Twenty albums later, Malmsteen’s influence can be heard in the style of modern shredders and even thrash giants. Before delving into pure neoclassical shred, Marty Friedman became a thrash god with Megadeth. Between his and Dave Mustaine’s refined playing, Friedman brought Megadeth’s sound to a more sophisticated place than their thrash contemporaries. It’s no wonder why Friedman is often thought of as the most missed member of Megadeth. Check out the 10 Greatest Neoclassical Guitarists in the Loud List above! Watch More Loud Lists!

73,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-greatest-nirvana-riffs/,"We continue our series of ""Greatest Riffs"" Loud Lists with the most dominant rock band of the 1990s, Nirvana. A rock and roll riff machine, Kurt Cobain created (or straight-up lifted) some of the most iconic guitar leads of the past 30 years. You’re probably assuming we put “Smells Like Teen Spirit” at No. 1, right? Not so fast! Though “Smells Like Teen Spirit” is perhaps the definitive song of the ‘90s, we think there’s at least one better riff from Nirvana’s collection. Though we adore the four-chord perfection of “Teen Spirit,” one In Utero cut stands out with even greater character, and more importantly, originality. For all you Bleach fans, don’t worry, we added the best lick from Nirvana’s debut album because few songs can boast the raw power of the intro for “School.” We even pulled a track from Nirvana’s Incesticide compilation. Nope, it’s not “Sliver.” We actually gave the nod to “Dive,” a deeply underrated track that celebrates Nirvana’s sludge influences. Nirvana’s “All Apologies” often gets credit as the ultimate softer song in the Seattle band’s collection. Kurt Cobain’s vocal approach is stunning on the track, but that main riff is intoxicating. You’ll see “All Apologies” take a high position in this video as well.

74,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-greatest-rage-against-the-machine-riffs/,"Our next Greatest Riffs Loud List is focused on the once-in-a-generation political powerhouse Rage Against the Machine. Though the band only released three original full-length albums, this was still one of the most difficult riffs lists we’ve put together. The world of rock owes a debt of gratitude to riffmaster Tom Morello and the deep grooves of Tim Commerford. The force of RATM’s music is spread pretty evenly between the band’s four members, but the riffs have always been what caused Rage’s fans to explode at each live show. Rage’s self-titled album is riff heaven. Tom Morello was a serious guitar virtuoso even back in his 20s, writing iconic leads for songs like “Bombtrack,” “Wake Up” and “Killing in the Name.” We were immediately introduced to his expansive use of the guitar in the early ‘90s as well, like Morello’s iconic use of his axe’s pickup switch on “Know Your Enemy.” Moving on to The Battle of Los Angeles, Rage Against the Machine brought their riff game back to the days of their first album. “Testify” grabs listeners immediately, holding on with an iron grip as the album delves into “Guerrilla Radio” and “Sleep Now in the Fire” in the first half alone! “Born of a Broken Man” is incredible as well, standing out as perhaps RATM’s most underrated monster riff.

75,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-greatest-rammstein-riffs/,"Our next countdown focuses on one of modern metal’s most riff-oriented bands, Rammstein! Heavier than a Till hammer, Rammstein’s riffs are the driving force of the band and we’ve narrowed their finest leads down to this Top 10 list! “Du Hast” has got to be one of the most headbangable songs in history. Once that guitar lead hit after the electronic ramp-up, all hell breaks loose at a Rammstein show. The Grammy-winning Sehnsucht cut has one of the most menacing riffs in modern metal, with the accompanying “Du Hast” video creeping out every MTV kid glued to their television. Speaking of HEAVY, how about that “Sonne” riff? It’s one of the main pieces to point to when discussing Rammstein’s mastery of rhythmic leads. The dark, brooding atmosphere completely overpowers Rammstein’s lyrics about the sun, which are fairly light-hearted. You wouldn’t guess it by the brutality of that lead riff, though. One of Rammstein fans’ all-time favorite tracks is “Engel,” which translates to “Angel.” It’s another simple riff, but cuts deep with its tone and precision. Guitarist Richard Kruspe will often talk about the importance of a strong picking hand when it comes to playing and “Engel” put that very strength on display.

To celebrate the greatest rock and metal guitarists who keep the foundation tight and unstoppable, Gear Factor and Squiggy present this Top 10 rhythm guitarists list. Malcolm Young — a rock legend we lost far too soon. Behind the flashy solos and wild antics of brother Angus, Malcolm Young kept AC/DC the most solid rock band perhaps of all time. Always perfectly in the pocket, Malcolm’s rhythm playing was inspirational to countless guitarists, with the AC/DC legend often being called the greatest ever at rhythm guitar. Another rocker who shaped a generation of rhythm guitarists is Johnny Ramone. Down stroking power chords almost exclusively, Johnny helped give the Ramones a raw style that had been touched on by the Stooges, but never fully explored. Johnny essentially invented the punk rock style, which would later be copied by speed metal and pop punk bands, not to mention every punk band to ever exist. In 2018, the world’s most powerful rhythm machine is undoubtedly Meshuggah. Accompanied by complex timing and a disgusting tone, Marten Hagstrom is a massive piece of what keeps Meshuggah pumping. No matter how many times ‘Shuggah switch time signatures, Hagstrom is always perfect, never allowing a moment of human weakness to be shown onstage.

77,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-greatest-rock-moments-in-live-tv-history/,"Live television was once the conduit for bringing rock ’n’ roll into the homes of millions, but things certainly have changed, haven’t they? As we yearn for the good old days, let’s check out some of the greatest rock moments in the history of live TV. The MTV Video Music Awards was the central hub for live rock in the ‘90s, producing some truly unforgettable moments. Pushing the boundaries of conventional taste, MTV allowed Marilyn Manson to deliver an anti-religious ‘State of the Union’ address, where he dismissed “the fascism of Christianity” and “the fascism of beauty.” It was extremely powerful, as was Nirvana’s iconic performance of “Lithium,” which almost got taken off the air when Kurt Cobain began strumming the chords to “Rape Me.” Few performances scream “Rock Gods!” more than Queen’s set at Live Aid 1985. With just 25 minutes to play, Queen roared through one of the most powerful gigs in history, and it was all broadcast live throughout the world. Now that the show can be watched on-demand via YouTube, the performance will forever live on as the moment Queen became the undisputed heavyweight champions of rock ’n’ roll. Not all of these moments are performances, though Dee Snider’s surgical destruction of the PMRC could certainly be considered one. Dee’s entire testimony is must-watch stuff, as the Twisted Sister icon defended heavy metal as a whole, serving a hot plate of logic to Al Gore himself, whose wife Tipper was intent on blacklisting “offensive” content in music. You can’t help but wonder how hot under the collar Al Gore was when Snider accused the politician’s wife of searching for S&M references for her own perverted mind.

As the year draws to a close, we’ve rounded up our picks for the 10 Greatest Rock Songs of 2017. The breakout rock band of 2017 is undoubtedly Greta Van Fleet. Though the young throwback band hasn’t even recorded a full-length album, Greta’s two 2017 EPs, Black Smoke Rising and From the Fires, generated tons of buzz. “Highway Tune” even hit No. 1 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart and the video, which debuted here at Loudwire, has accumulated 6.5 million views on YouTube. A Perfect Circle surprised fans with new music in 2017, intriguing the rock world with “The Doomed.” The cut is wildly multi-dimensional, bringing electronic, war metal and twinkling ballad dynamics into the fold. “The Doomed” doesn’t necessarily offer any clues as to what APC’s fourth studio album will sound like, but the track has kept fans seething for the band’s next offering. During a year when we lost both Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington to suicide, both musicians released gorgeous ballads in 2017. Chris Cornell’s “The Promise” reminded the world of the Soundgarden legend’s incredible vocal prowess, and while Linkin Park’s One More Light album was heavily criticized, the heart-wrenching title track holds up.

79,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-greatest-slayer-riffs-watch/,"Continuing our Loud List series on rock and metal’s best riffs, we move on to arguably thrash’s most powerful riff machine, Slayer. Throughout Jeff Hanneman’s lifetime, he composed a collection of metal’s most sinister and uncomfortable riffs worthy of the most terrifying of hellscapes. The intro riff for “Raining Blood” is one of the most intense leads in music history, instantly burning itself into your memory on first listen. Reign in Blood is full of classic riffs, including the somewhat underrated “Postmortem,” which Hanneman also composed. Slayer were riff masters from their very first album, Show No Mercy, especially with the first track of side two, “Black Magic.” A few years later, Slayer had further developed their signature sound, abandoning many of the NWOBHM dynamics which influenced their early songs. Hell Awaits is perhaps when Slayer truly became the band we know today, with “At Dawn They Sleep” setting a terrifying tone for what was to come. When Slayer decided to change things up with the masterful South of Heaven, they didn’t jettison riffage like they did with relentless speed. South of Heaven is a gold mine of riffs, boasting incredible licks like “Silent Scream,” “Live Undead,” “Mandatory Suicide” and, of course, the album’s title track.

All four members of the Armenian-American quartet are essential in keeping SOAD’s sound so unique, but the band’s collection of riffs is seriously mesmerizing. Metalhead music theory nerds will tell you the same — System of a Down completely abducted the harmonic minor scale. If any modern act tries to write using that scale, they’ll automatically be compared to SOAD… that’s how gigantic System’s impact was with incorporating Middle Eastern influence. You can hear it all over System of a Down’s debut album, especially on cuts like “Spiders” and “Know.” If System of a Down is riff heaven, Toxicity brought fans to Valhalla. The album which cemented SOAD as a worldwide phenomenon saves an incredible amount of power for the back half. After pummeling fans with modern classics like “Prison Song” and “Chop Suey!”, Toxicity features one of the strongest closing tracks in rock and metal history, “Aerials,” and that comes after fans had their minds blown with “Science,” “Psycho” and the album’s title track. It’s been a long and painful wait since SOAD unleashed both Mezmerize and Hypnotize in 2005. Both albums had their share of incredible riffs, like the rapid-fire “B.Y.O.B."" and they both showcase a more sombre side of System as well, as Daron Malakian leads the way with “Hypnotize,” “Lonely Day” and “Lost in Hollywood.” Check out our picks for the 10 Greatest System of a Down Riffs in the Loud List above! 10 Greatest Rage Against The Machine Riffs 10 Greatest Tool Riffs ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202496.35/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321051516-20190321073516-00447.warc.gz

Whether the band’s songs were carried by guitarist Adam Jones or bassists Paul D’Amour and Justin Chancellor, Tool have put together a gigantic collection of riffs for a band with just four albums and one EP. You’ll find riffs spanning Tool’s entire career in this list, starting from the Opiate EP. You can truly hear the birth of Tool on Opiate as Jones was just beginning to become a riff master. The Tool guys upped their game with their first full-length, Undertow, gifting fans with powerful leads like “Bottom” and “Prison Sex.” If you’re only just starting to get into Tool, we advise you begin with Riff Heaven… also know as Ænima. Every single full track has at least one amazing riff, most notably “Forty Six & 2,” “Pushit” and “Ænema,” but there’s literally no bad place to start in Ænima. As for albums, it’s about as perfect as a band can hope for. Tool continued their prestige into the 21st century with Lateralus and 10,000 Days. The massive success of “Schism” brought the greatest bass riff of the 2000s, with Adam Jones adding a second dimension with his guitar work. As for 10,000 Days, the prize riff is arguably “Jambi,” which could be the most sonically heavy Tool lead ever.

The country that gave us the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and countless other legends, has also been the world’s leader in heavy metal, giving birth the genre in 1970 with the almighty Black Sabbath. Metal only expanded from there, delivering Judas Priest and Motorhead just a few years later. Once Iron Maiden came into the fold in the early ‘80s, England’s fate as metal’s most important country was sealed in granite, never to be touched even when America flourished in the ‘80s with thrash and death metal. Extreme metal’s corpseflower also bloomed in the U.K. with Napalm Death and Carcass innovating the sound of grindcore. Of course, we wouldn’t have the term “black metal” without the iconic Venom, who personified the vision of evil within heavy metal, opening doors for fellow extreme pioneers like Cradle of Filth down the line.

Like true heroes, these 10 bands invited kids onstage to jam with them in front of hundreds or even thousands of people. It seems like once these rockers got to a monumental point in their careers, they wanted to give back. Everyone who has ever strummed a guitar or bashed a drum kit can look back to an idol who inspired them. Green Day’s Billie Joe Armstrong gives lucky fans the opportunity to join the band onstage every night, but in this instance, Armstrong reached out to a very young guitarist. Unsure at first if the kid knew the chords to “Jesus of Suburbia,” Billie kept a close eye on this youngster, but quickly understood the guitarist knew what he was doing. Metallica have been known to invite hoards of kids onstage to rock out with them. In this Loud List, you’ll see a group take hold of each instrument and jam “Seek & Destroy” with the thrash legends. One guitarist was hardly bigger than the axe itself! But he strapped it onto his shoulder and rocked the lead riff like a pro… in front of an arena crowd, no less. You’ll even see some musicians invite their own kids to jam with them. Dave Grohl gave his daughter a thrill by letting her drum on a cover of Queen’s “We Will Rock You” at a Foo Fighters gig in Iceland, while Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker handed off the sticks to his son, proving that talent certainly does run in the family.

Whether Blackmore is being purely ridiculous or has the world’s driest sense of humor, his interviews are the stuff YouTube wormholes are made of. Back in the Deep Purple days, Blackmore’s feud with singer Ian Gillan was very public. It got so bad that Blackmore actually divulged a plan to attack Gillan from behind with a mob of friends. “We’ll beat him up, but he won’t know it’s me,” the guitarist said, even though a camera was right in his face. Blackmore’s upbringing was quite strange, as he a describes his mother as a “gypsy” who used to “put spells on people.” Apparently, Ritchie picked up a few tricks from old Mum. “I learned all these curses and superstitions, how to read people’s minds,” Blackmore said before adding the comedic cherry, “And my father worked at the airport.” More philosophically, Blackmore also claims to think much more about death than life, as you’ll see in this video compilation. “I think death is very important. I think it’s going to happen to all of us,” he expressed before clarifying, “Most of us, not all.

With each era of shock rock, acts need to go further and further to elicit a great reaction. In the 1950s, shock rock was arguably invented by Screamin’ Jay Hawkins and popularized thanks to his blackout drunk recording of “I Put a Spell on You.” The following decade, Arthur Brown stoked further panic with “Fire.” Some of the most memorable moments in this list happened completely by accident. Alice Cooper’s infamous chicken incident only occurred to due Cooper’s fundamental misunderstanding of the birds. Needless to say, Alice learned that not all birds could fly after he threw a chicken into the air at a Toronto performance. When Ozzy Osbourne bit the head off a bat, he didn’t do it to personify evil or piss off animal rights activists. The Prince of Darkness thought a fan had thrown a rubber bat onstage, but after Oz chomped into it, he realized the mistake he had made. In more contemporary shock rock history, Gorgoroth became the 21st century’s most shocking band after their 2004 Black Mass in Krakow. Filling their stage with “crucified” nude models, Satanic symbolism, sheep heads impaled on stakes and 80 litres of sheep blood poured all over the stage, Gorgoroth were charged with religious crimes in Poland.

Metallica’s Some Kind of Monster documentary is essentially 141 minutes of drama starring metal’s most commercially successful band. Following Jason Newsted’s departure from Metallica, the band had to find a new bassist and write a new “comeback” album following the disappointing Load and Reload, all while navigating James Hetfield’s recovery from alcoholism. The moment we chose from the doc has become iconic not just for its incendiary words, but Kirk Hammett’s epic facepalm. John 5’s time with Marilyn Manson was chaotic to say the least, but most of the conflict took place off stage. However, one crack in the armor appeared when Manson full-on kicked John while performing “The Beautiful People” at Rock am Ring 2003. John threw down his guitar with rage, screaming at Manson. Things got ugly, but it didn’t get physical between the two, which can’t be said for Lamb of God. Randy Blythe and Mark Morton squared off in one of the ugliest bandmate brawls ever caught on film. An intoxicated Blythe had been antagonizing his bandmates, while threatening to “sucker punch” Morton.

One piece of footage comes from Rock on the Range 2012 during a Five Finger Death Punch set. FFDP crowds are notoriously crazy, especially when Ivan Moody asks fans to come up and shake his hand. In this clip, you can’t even see where the crowd surfing begins, with people being passed up over a hundred people deep. Also, make sure to look out for the empty wheelchair making its way to the front. Faith No More’s Mike Patton is already a hero to many, but he became a god with this crowd surfing moment. The crowd passed the vocalist all the way from the stage to the bar while he sung “Ashes to Ashes.” Patton even sat on the bar, screaming into fans’ faces for the rest of the song. What a legend.

Nirvana were lined up to play ""Lithium"" after a heated disagreement with MTV over the fact the Kurt Cobain had insisted the band play ""Rape Me"" on national television instead. The grunge act caved in to the demands, but when you're live and the cameras are rolling, anything can happen. Before launching into ""Lithium,"" Nirvana's controversial moment came when they played the opening chords of ""Rape Me,"" which their frontman had so ardently championed. But wait, there's more! Later on, Krist Novoselic hurled his bass upward, only to watch it return on a downward trajectory straight to his face. After all was finished, Dave Grohl grabbed the mic and taunted Guns N' Roses' frontman, repeatedly saying, ""Hi Axl! Hi Axl!"" Was it risky? For sure. But it worked — we wouldn't be talking about it today if it didn't! 1995: Courtney Love Crashes Madonna Interview at MTV VMAs Poor Kurt Loder. They say to live life with no regrets, but we're sure the anchor would love to take a mulligan for his interview with Madonna at the 1995 MTV VMAs. All was going smoothly until Courtney Love hurled her shoe up toward Loder and Madonna. Despite pleas from the pop star to keep Love out of the interview, Loder waived her up anyway. Slurring her speech, Love realized she was interrupting, apologized and then crouched down on the floor to discuss footwear, among other things. The MTV anchor realized his lapse in judgement and dismissed Madonna while awkwardly trying to recover his greasy-handed fumble. No regrets, huh? 1996: Van Halen (With David Lee Roth) Go Off Script at MTV VMAs, Things Get Awkward Nothing about a Van Halen original lineup reunion was cemented at this point, but all signs pointed north as the four classic members of the party rock act made their first public appearance together in over a decade at the 1996 MTV VMAs. This night would live in infamy in VH lore for destroying a chance for the reunion to materialize, as David Lee Roth went off script, much to the chagrin of his guitar player Eddie. A blowout ensued backstage after the band presented the Best Male Video of the Year, leading to the most maligned era of Van Halen's career as they then enlisted former Extreme singer Gary Cherone as their new frontman. 1997: Marilyn Manson Condemns Society + Religion, Strips Down to Leather Lingerie at 1997 MTV VMAs You can't have awards show controversy without Marilyn Manson's name cropping up at least once (more on that to come). As you've certainly come to notice, the MTV VMAs have been a lightning rod for outrageous moments and the shock rock industrialist made headlines (quite the common feat) as he took the podium for a State of the Union-like address. Preaching from his mic-adorned pulpit, Manson confidently condemned the ""fascism of Christianity"" and the ""fascism of beauty,"" setting up his deranged performance of ""The Beautiful People."" As the network likely breathed a sigh of relief that Manson's controversial moment was behind him, he then stripped down to a leather corset and matching banana hammock. Beautiful. 1998: Marilyn Manson's Outfit Raises Eyebrows Apparently not enough people called the FCC after Marilyn Manson's performance at the MTV VMAs the previous year, as he was invited back in 1998. While many held the belief that the awards was a pretty dope show, Manson had a different ""Dope Show"" in mind. Everything was surprisingly normal (as normal as anything can be in the realm of Marilyn Manson)... until he shed his fluffy blue boa in a gender-bending showcase. His latex blue suit was exposed with prominent, nipple-less breasts and viewers were reminded of what his backside looks like in case they had scrubbed it from memory after the rocker's 1997 stunt. How's that for your next day wardrobe wrap-up, Joan Rivers? (R.I.P.) 2000: Rage Against the Machine's Tim Commerford Protests Limp Bizkit's MTV VMAs Win Who remembers when this happened? During Limp Bizkit's acceptance speech for Best Rock Video at the 2000 MTV VMAs, Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford wasn't having it. True to his band's name, Commerford engaged in a silent but camera-worthy protest, scaling the sharp-angled fixture set behind the acceptance podium. Fred Durst asserted that the whole ordeal was ""pretty phat"" and recognized how true the defiant act was to the spirit of rock 'n' roll, even conceding that Commerford ""should be getting the award."" Perhaps the red-capped frontman sniffed out the motive. Anyway, MTV wound up cutting to commercial while security earned their paychecks and the bassist was jailed for the night. 2007: Tommy Lee + Kid Rock Fight Over Pamela Anderson at MTV VMAs Another MTV VMAs in the books, another infinitely memorable moment! Unlike so many other wild incidents in the awards show's history, the punch-up between Kid Rock and Motley Crue drummer / wildman Tommy Lee stemmed from a previous event. Both rockers had been married to Pamela Anderson at different points in their respective careers and when Lee said some unsavory things to Kid Rock prior to the 2007 VMAs (while at a birthday party for Anderson's son), both saw red when they met face to face. Fists were thrown and tables cleared after Kid Rock found the skinsman occupying his seat at the table after returning from the bathroom. Naturally, the police sorted out the details that followed. 2013: The Dillinger Escape Plan's Greg Puciato Cuts His Face Open at Revolver Golden Gods, Band Wrecks Their Gear Blood at a Dillinger show? Well, that actually sounds about right, but typically it comes from the pit, not down the forehead of frontman Greg Puciato. There was blood, there was sweat and now we're shedding tears that the band has decided to call it a career. We'll miss the erratic and downright dangerous performances The Dillinger Escape Plan have provided over the years — like their set at the 2013 Revolver Golden Gods. At the tail of their showcase, Puciato made fire marshals bug-eyed with a fire breathing stunt and the set culminated in TDEP thrashing their equipment, leaving the stage more battered than their singer's face. 2014: Revolver Golden Gods Credit Warrant's Jani Lane as Motorhead Member During 'Fallen Heroes' Tribute The ""Fallen Heroes"" segment of the 2014 Revolver Golden Gods was poised to be an all-time highlight. With Zakk Wylde seated in front of a piano performing ""In This River"" (written as a tribute to the late Pantera riff-slinger Dimebag Darrell), images of rock and metal's departed icons flashed by on a massive screen behind him. What was supposed to be one of the most touching moments in rock was derailed when late Warrant singer Jani Lane was seen, regrettably credited as a member of Motorhead.

A term taken from the irritating buzzing noise mosquitos make, paparazzi often unearth the worst from the celebrities they cover, thanks to a willful invasion of privacy and somewhat predatory tactics to get their subject on film. What does it take for Good Guy Grohl to actually lose his cool? Paparazzi. The Foo Fighters frontman has sparred with them various times, asking if they were a gang in one clip and encouraging them to follow Tori Spelling, who was just down the street. In this compilation, you’ll see a short moment at the airport where Grohl responds to a question about Katy Perry, saying, “Dude, I don’t do interviews with people that aren’t fucking journalists.” Axl Rose actually fought a paparazzo at an airport in 2009. As you can see in the first seconds of the clip, a man grabs a female member of Rose’s entourage by the arm and pushes her aside, prompting an angry response from the GN’R singer. When tensions didn’t die down, Rose lunged at a media member, punching them in the head before the scuffle was ultimately broken up. Even the ever chill Paul McCartney has battled paparazzi in the past. After asking cameramen numerous times to leave him and wife Nancy Shevell alone, Sir Paul verbally decimated the pap. “You’ve got the morals of what? Morals of a rat,” the Beatle said unapologetically. A trip down the YouTube wormhole will show plenty of Macca vs. paparazzi moments, but this was our No. 1 contender.

If you’re anything like us, you look to music for moments of levity, so we put together these 10 tracks to boost your spirits during a dark time. A major determining factor for this list is a song’s lyrics. The untrained ear may miss the inspirational messages hidden within guttural vocals, but for Lamb of God fans, “Walk With Me in Hell” is a lifeline offered via stereo. Randy Blythe presents the listener a gift of companionship with lyrics like, “Take hold of my hand / For you are no longer alone / Walk with me in Hell.” These words have given countless fans a glimmer of hope during life’s terrible moments, replayed again and again for sacred comfort. If there’s one metal band that represents empowerment and destroying the demons of past, it’s Pantera. These factors are demonstrated perfectly throughout “A New Level.” The cut has inspired fans who feel “Shit on, pissed on, spit on, stepped on, fucked with” to leave their old trials behind in favor of a new life. The song’s chorus, “A new level of confidence and power,” is one of metal’s most iconic and its transformative vigor remains unscarred by time. Iron Maiden cranked out one of metal’s most inspiring tunes on Somewhere in Time, not just in terms of lyrics, but mood. “Wasted Years” is an eloquent reminder to focus on the beauty of today rather than time wasted or unappreciated. With its euphoric chorus, “Wasted Years” often brings grown adults to tears at Iron Maiden shows. Are you one of them?

Whether you get an electrifying concert or an unmitigated disaster is a flip of the coin, but no matter what happens, you’re unlikely to forget witnessing the Antichrist Superstar live. Manson has been dangerous from the very beginning. After Manson exploded with his second full-length album 1996's Antichrist Superstar, he began playing huge shows around the world. At the 1997 Bizarre Festival, Manson went a bit nuts on his drummer, throwing drinks and gear behind the kit. Around this same era, Manson almost demolished Twiggy Ramirez with a mic stand, knocking over some PA speakers instead. Some of these moments are fiercely entertaining, while others (like Manson’s 2012 Soundwave run) left fans feeling disappointed. During Soundwave, Manson was in rare form, slurring his words while singing and talking with the crowd. Manson always aims to be an agent of chaos, but sometimes his unhinged nature ends up taking away from the fans enjoying his music. Manson hasn’t been above assaulting his own bandmates onstage. It’s been both hilarious and confusing each time, like when he gave John 5 a kick while performing “The Beautiful People” at a festival. Another instance shows a wild Manson knocking over his bassist before punching out one of his own stage lights.

No exaggeration: virtually every teenage boy who spent parts of that decade listening to metal in their bedrooms, was most likely doing so while flipping through the pages of Stephen King’s growing bibliography.

For this Loud List, we rounded up some of the most obscure branches of metal’s family tree. It was only a matter of time before surf metal and ska metal were attempted by some mad metal scientists. We’re not saying it works, necessarily, but the song “R.I.P.TIDE” by a band of the same name, is entertaining at the least and deserves more than a measly thousand views on YouTube. Same goes with “Cosmic Super Ghoul” by ska metal weirdos Gloominous Doom. Onto concoctions that (by all conventional wisdom) shouldn’t have worked, but did, we arrive at Zeal & Ardor. The only act to ever attempt mixing blues, black metal and slave spirituals, they got metalheads’ attention with Devil is Fine, only to follow it up with one of 2018’s finest releases, Stranger Fruit. The underground phenomenon of Z&A still isn’t on most metalheads’ radars, but absolutely should be. Metal fiends may be familiar with Nekrogoblikon’s brand of goblin metal, but an equally hilarious brand of music was spawned a decade ago — Orc rock. This is thanks to one-man vocal/keyboard project ORCumentary, which proves to be the guiltiest of pleasures alongside Mac Sabbath or Okilly Dokilly.

95,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-moments-that-nearly-destroyed-rock/,"Some moments in time were so pivotal that they changed the course of rock ’n’ roll history. We’ve put together 10 of these moments, that if altered only slightly, could have destroyed rock music. In 1948, the iconic inventor of the solid-body electric guitar, Les Paul, almost died in a car accident before he could design the technological innovations that made modern music possible. While recovering in the hospital for over a year, Paul was given more than enough time to think, allowing him to perfect a new technology called multitrack recording. A couple of years later, the Gibson Les Paul was designed, and where would rock be without the Les Paul? Black Sabbath‘s Tony Iommi is the godfather of heavy metal, but his career was almost cut short at 17-years-old, when he was involved in an industrial accident that chopped off the tips of the middle and ring fingers on his fretting hand. As a result, Iommi adjusted his approach to guitar, with down-tuned strings to ease his playing, creating a signature sound for Black Sabbath. Had the accident been worse, heavy metal as we know it may have never existed. Should music be “rated” in the way that movies are? Back in 1985, an organization called the Parents Music Resource Center -- the PMRC for short -- argued for that very system. To help support their argument, they came up with a list of songs, known as “The Filthy Fifteen,” including Venom, Mercyful Fate, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, AC/DC and Twisted Sister. To battle the PMRC, Dee Snider and Frank Zappa took on Tipper Gore and her panel, testifying on live television and helping rescue music from the grips of censorship.

There’s actually plenty of room for beauty within the bloodshed, and we put together our picks for the most beautiful voices in death metal history. Gutturals can certainly be beautiful, like an ugly baby can be gorgeous in the eyes of a parent, but we narrowed this list down to clean singing. Most of these vocalists are brilliant in both styles, like Opeth frontman Mikael Akerfeldt. If anyone made grace and sophistication cool in death metal, it’s Akerfeldt. For decades, he’s been the vocal embodiment of Lucifer — singing like an angel while unleashing howls from the depths of Hell. Amorphis experienced their Renaissance when Tomi Joutsen joined in 2005. Having taken a death-doom approach in their early days, Amorphis found their identity when Joutsen’s voice made them one of the best melodeath acts on the planet. That sentiment extends to 2018, with Amorphis’ excellent 13th album, Queen of Time. Not every voice in this list is beautiful in the realm of pop sensibility. Sotiris Anunnaki V of Greek symphonic death metallers Septicflesh offers a vintage approach to singing. Accenting the medieval and romantic-era orchestrations of the band, Sotiris sings almost like a witch casting a spell, but the whimsy of his technique is hauntingly warm.

For this list, we took into account sonic heaviness, lyrical content, vocal delivery, production, how brutal the song was considered at the time of its release and much more. We also didn’t limit ourselves to brutal death metal, as audio savagery can come in many styles. Of course, Cannibal Corpse takes a high spot on this list for their revolutionarily heavy “Hammer Smashed Face.” Never has a song represented the violence of brutal death metal so perfectly, and the time of its release, it was the most offensively disturbing track to become fiendishly popular. Its inclusion in Ace Ventura is stuff of legend, and its lyrics still gut listeners 25 years after its release. As metal continued to get heavier in the 21st century, bands took down-tuning and guttural vocals to their very depths. During the rise of deathcore, Whitechapel stood out for their brutal tone and depraved lyrics, earning them greater admiration than their deathcore contemporaries. We’d also be remiss to neglect Cerebral Bore, one of the most overlooked metal acts of the 2010s. Though they only released one album, “The Bald Cadaver” contains some of the most chilling lyrics in metal history, and the fact they’re delivered by a female vocalist earns them extra brutality points.

If it wasn't for a hotel receptionist calling Guns' management one night, Slash may have never been resuscitated after literally dying from an overdose. Drummer Steven Adler nearly faced death, as well, suffering from a cocaine-induced stroke at the height of his addiction. Guns N' Roses history is also plagued by a number of riots which took place after the band stopped performing mid-show, one such instance taking place after Axl Rose attacked a photographer.

The insane amount of money spent on Guns N’ Roses’ Chinese Democracy album has become stuff of legend. It took a freaking decade to finish GN’R’s sixth record, with the list of personnel longer than the credits of a Kanye West album. Reports indicate that $13 million was spent on the effort, making it the most expensive album in history, minus Michael Jackson’s Invincible. One incredibly costly album that actually paid off was Def Leppard’s classic Hysteria. The band reportedly spent $4.5 million on the 1987 release, which inflates up to roughly $10.2 million in today’s market. Thankfully, the album sold over 25 million copies worldwide, easily making up for its humongous budget. Hell, the guys in Def Leppard may have even taken home some extra scratch. During the height of their career, Korn had plenty of cash to burn, which they did ad nauseam for 2002’s Untouchables.

An incredible voice isn’t always necessary when a band writes great songs, but when a vocalist goes from unpolished and off-pitch to being a skilled powerhouse, the band always hits a new level of success. M. Shadows wasn’t always one of his generation’s top singers. When Avenged Sevenfold released Sounding of the Seventh Trumpet in 2001, they didn’t stand out much amongst their metalcore/post-hardcore contemporaries. After experiencing vocal issues so severe he needed surgery, Shadows had to reinvent his style and technique, leading to his arena-filling performances we all know today. Early fans of Peter Steele’s thrash band Carnivore had absolutely no idea what the man was capable of vocally. Steele utilized a gritty bark on his ‘80s material, fitting Carnivore’s New York sound, but offering no melody or harmony. Steele became a master of both dynamics in the ‘90s with Type O Negative, elevating the singer to iconic status thanks to his deep bass-baritone and heart-wrenching delivery. Mastodon’s Troy Sanders deserves a lot of respect for his growth as a singer. Starting with brutal caveman grunts on Remission, Sanders’ style was already captivating, but when he switched largely to clean singing, Troy didn’t immediately nail the technique.

One of the most evil sonic ceremonies you can witness is Behemoth live. Beyond the blood, fire and iconography, Behemoth turn each show into a black mass, practicing magick and Satanic worship every night. Ever since the release of The Satanist, Behemoth have ramped up their live show to create the most intense experience possible, and if you’re up front, you may even receive communion. Gorgoroth’s 2004 Black Mass in Krakow was so controversial that the concert footage was originally confiscated by police. It was eventually released in 2008, depicting sheep heads on stakes, crucified nude models and 80 liters of sheep blood. Black Mass Krakow is still the most legitimately terrifying concert ever filmed, as Gorgoroth turned their stage into a living image from Hell. Some of these live bands are terrifying due to the legitimate danger of attending the gig. The Dillinger Escape Plan put on some of the most insane shows in rock history, and if you were in the front 10 rows, you were probably smashed in the head by either Greg Puciato or Ben Weinman.

103,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-most-underrated-bands-1970s/,"In this new string of Loud Lists, we pay tribute to the often overlooked bands of each decade. First up — the most underrated bands of the 1970s. The ‘70s was a time when experimentation was at its peak in popular music. Rolling off the LSD movement of the late ‘60s, more bands began to explore alternate dimensions with their music. No weirder band came out of the ‘70s than Magma, a progressive / art rock collective that sang using an entirely fictional language, Kobaïan. As punk rock began its ascent in the 1970s, bands like the Ramones and the Sex Pistols led rock’s most dangerous genre into the public eye. Punk exploded by the late ‘70s, but acts like the Stranglers and the Damned never quite hit that iconic level of their peers, despite releasing incredible music during punk’s heyday. The decade was one of the most exciting times for progressive rock. Though some bands turned the genre into a bloated instrumental wankfest, others balanced infinite dynamics with expert virtuosity. Never truly appreciated in their time, Camel released seven studio albums in the 1970s and they’ve held up incredibly over time.

We went through out music collections to pull out the most underrated bands of the 1980s. One of Switzerland’s finest metal exports, Coroner, put out three filthy albums in the late ‘80s. Based in thrash, Coroner were a highly experimental band for the genre, incorporating progressive, highly technical and avant-garde styles into their sound. Though Coroner haven’t put out an album since 1993, they’re still touring today, so go check them out! If you’ve delved into the ‘80s, chances are you’ve come across Manilla Road. The heavy metallers filled the ‘80s with a total of seven studio albums, including underground classics like Crystal Logic and The Deluge. Perhaps Mark Shelton’s vocal didn’t vibe with the increasingly heavy decade, but Manilla Road’s music has withstood the test of time and found a new audience in the 21st century. Though they came up in the CBGB movement that spawned Blondie and the Ramones, punk weirdos the Cramps didn’t get their due like their contemporaries. Pioneering the psychobilly subgenre, the Cramps remained underground heroes throughout their career, releasing their most celebrated material in the ‘80s.

Having already paid respect to bands from the days of heavy metal’s birth, the NWOBHM and the dawn of extreme music, we’re getting into the alt-dominated decade of the ‘90s. While Nirvana and Pearl Jam were releasing albums that sold over 10 million copies, bands like Dinosaur Jr. and Screaming Trees experienced much more modest success. Though their music was boosted by the alt/grunge wave, even landing them on late night talk shows, both bands were very underrated, yet stood the test of time. If you type “Demolition Hammer” into Google, you’ll get page after page of power tools instead of the NYC thrash band. Coming up just after thrash’s golden age, DH released three albums in the early ‘90s via Century Media. The band absolutely crushed, but their complex structures didn’t meld with an audience that was further embracing the art of simplicity. We’d be remiss to ignore the desert rock pioneers of Kyuss. The California stoner act set the stage for Queens of the Stone Age’s 2000s explosion, but more importantly, Kyuss put out some incredible albums in the early-to-mid ‘90s. Though John Garcia was a great singer, Josh Homme was the real star of Kyuss thanks to his filthy riffing and wildly inventive soloing.

In this list, we’ll go through 10 bands that crushed in the 2000s, but didn’t quite get their due. It seems insane in 2019, but there was a time when Avenged Sevenfold and Poison the Well were equally big acts in the “core” underground. As A7X hit a commercial stride, Poison the Well decided to shift their sound into an avant-garde direction, remaining 10 creative steps ahead of their contemporaries at all times. Unfortunately, experimental brilliance almost never comes with mass appeal. As bands like Mastodon and Baroness became leaders of the southern sludge wave, Kylesa were right there with them, releasing tripped out gems throughout the decade. The band’s masterpiece is generally considered to be 2009’s Static Tensions, and the album blew minds, despite never bringing the group to the heights of Mastodon. The 2000s was also a killer decade for punk rock. As pop-punk became rock’s biggest phenomenon, true underground punk flourished with acts like Strike Anywhere and The Bronx. They may have never filled an arena like Blink-182, but the two bands created 21st century masterworks which remain modern classics in the minds of punk and hardcore fanatics.

Oh, Chad Kroeger… you should have just kept your mouth shut about Stone Sour. With all the good faith Corey Taylor has built in the rock and metal world versus the hatred Nickelback has received, Kroeger’s “Nickelback Lite” comments had zero percent chance of going over well. Slipknot and Stone Sour fans went all-in against Kroeger, even going as far as to chant “Fuck Nickelback” during Stone Sour sets, much to Taylor’s joy. Sharon Osbourne has long been a self-professed evildoer in the music industry, but it’s worked for her as Ozzy Osbourne’s longtime manager and the founder of Ozzfest. Sharon really drew the ire of Iron Maiden fans in 2005 when she orchestrated an egging of the legendary band at Ozzfest. Iron Maiden didn’t stand down, with Bruce Dickinson suggesting fans break the arm of anyone they see throwing an egg. Sharon later bragged about the incident on The Howard Stern Show. Lars Ulrich and Napster became the most mortal of enemies in the early 2000s, so much that the two names will be forever entangled. Attacking a service that illegally gave Metallica’s music to fans wasn’t the issue though, Ulrich’s PR nightmare came after he ratted out over 300,000 Metallica fans to the site, leading to the suspension of their accounts.

Fact is, heavy music has always had, in the words of Spinal Tap manager Ian Faith, a “selective” audience, otherwise known as “limited commercial potential,” and thus, if bands couldn’t or wouldn’t pen material that was either more accessible or less heavy-handed, they were often pressured to cut a previous hit that might expand their fan base.

109,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-power-ballads-dont-suck/,"Ah, the infamous power ballad. For many headbangers, a love/hate relationship exists with this tried and true song format. Prior to the ascent of hair metal and MTV, power ballads highlighted the warring energies of the light against heavy dynamic made for some of the finest moments in heavy music. So how did we get to the point where the natural reaction is to cringe at the very mention of the term? Hordes of hair bands brought metal to the mainstream, selling millions upon millions of records, typically due to sappy tunes that weren't indicative of a band's true sound. There was no hiding what was at play and these acts were readily dismissed as sellouts by the heavy metal faithful. But that doesn't mean it's all bad. Alice Cooper, ever the musical chameleon, kept pace with the current music scene when he released the smash hit ""Poison,"" which flipped the script on ""love to hate"" to ""hate to love"" as the song, cheesy as it is, proved to be far too catchy to discard alongside other feckless power ballad cash-ins. Even within the glam scene itself fortunes were to be had (by way of song, not just royalty checks) in Cinderella's ""Nobody's Fool"" and Pantera, unrepentantly heavy as they retooled their sound, were in on the game with the ageless ""Cemetery Gates.""

Well, we woke up on the right side of the bed this morning, so here are some reasons why 2017 was a great year for rock and metal! 2017 saw the glorious return of guitar icon Zakk Wylde to Ozzy Osbourne’s band. The beloved axeman was immediately embraced by Ozzy fans and Zakk proceeded to shred (even with the guitar behind his back and with his teeth), making a triumphant return. Powering Ozzy’s live show with classic leads and ripping 10-minute guitar solo clinics, Wylde once again proved himself as an unstoppable force behind a six-string. In the metal realm, 2017 belonged to Power Trip. The crossover thrashers from Texas dropped Loudwire’s pick for Metal Album of the Year with Nightmare Logic, a masterful piece of lean and crushing music. The excitement Power Trip brought to thrash can be compared to the rise of Municipal Waste a decade earlier, and it was much needed and much appreciated by the masses. Another essential act this year was Mastodon, who didn’t just release an album in 2017… they pumped out an EP as well. Emperor of Sand placed high on countless year-end lists for 2017, while the Cold Dark Place EP was warmly received by fans who appreciated yet another Masto experiment.

The Grammys had a rough 2017 during the show’s highly anticipated collaboration between Metallica and Lady Gaga. MetalliGaga performed “Moth Into Flame” at the ceremony, but ran into technical difficulties when James Hetfield’s mic turned out to be dead. Papa Het’s mic came back on during the second verse, but that didn’t stop the Metallica frontman from being visibly pissed off once the song came to an end. We lost some legends this year and 2017 was particularly brutal on the rock world. Soundgarden’s Chris Cornell and Linkin Park’s Chester Bennington both committed suicide weeks apart from each other, fueling a mental health debate which lasted for much of the year. The music world also suffered the loss of Tom Petty and AC/DC guitarist Malcolm Young, among many others. 2017 was also the year of the sexual misconduct ""watershed moment,"" led by the takedown of media mogul Harvey Weinstein. Accusations and admissions of sexual harassment and assault began coming from all sides of the entertainment industry, including music. Brand New’s Jesse Lacey and Pierce the Veil’s Mike Fuentes were both accused on misconduct with underage fans, with Fuentes announcing his departure from Pierce the Veil in response.

Those were the days… Check out these 10 Ridiculous Talk Show Moments! The best talk show moments in rock history were always made on those daytime “tabloid talk” shows in the ‘90s. During the early years of Marilyn Manson, the band appeared on The Phil Donahue Show during an episode where concerned parents debated the scourge of moshing. Manson debated moshing and rock music with his trademark tact and calm demeanor, surprising the audience of rubes with his rationalization skills. GWAR also made daytime talk show gold, appearing on a Jerry Springer episode dedicated to “shock rock” in 1997. GWAR took the show semi-seriously, with Oderus Urungus pretending to break down and cry while apologizing for being a negative influence on kids. Urungus brilliantly turned the discussion around on a critical mother, though, suggesting she was just looking for negative aspects in GWAR’s music instead of taking responsibility for her crappy parenting. You’ve probably never heard of The Girlie Show, but it had a short run on British television from 1996-1997. On one episode of the talk show, Motorhead legend Lemmy Kilmister was surprised by three of his ex-lovers, who all joined him on the couch for a special reunion. Kelly Johnson of Girlschool even made an appearance, taking a spot between Lemmy’s legs during the show.

Once you've found one, convincing everyone in the group to agree on it is all the more challenging. By this point, so many names have come off the board, that it's more of a problem than ever, but we have a suggestion: add ""black"" in there somewhere. If your band takes off, anyone perusing their nearest music outlet (yes, they still exist) will inevitably hover over the ""B"" section, scouting the crop of Black Sabbath albums.

In this Loud List, we’ll take you through 10 songs you probably thought were originals, but are covers which became far more successful. When Nirvana took the stage for their iconic Unplugged session, the seminal grunge band performed some of the most transformative covers in rock history. Kurt Cobain’s approach to David Bowie’s “The Man Who Sold the World,” the Meat Puppets’ “Lake of Fire” and others have transcended music, but four years earlier, Nirvana released a cover as their first official single. “Love Buzz” is widely known as a Nirvana track, but it was actually written by Dutch band Shocking Blue for their 1969 album, At Home. Black Sabbath’s 1970 debut album is hailed as the moment heavy metal was born, but some fans forget that Sabbath only wrote five originals for the record. Sabbath’s first single, “Evil Woman,” was written and recorded by American blues rock band Crow in 1969, actually making it to No. 19 on the Hot 100 chart. Black Sabbath’s version, however, didn’t chart in the U.S. at all. Ramones fans have always celebrated the band’s covers of “Surfin’ Bird” and “Do You Wanna Dance?” but it’s easy to forget that “California Sun” wasn’t a Ramones original. Before the Ramones sped up and amplified the rhythm and blues cut in 1977, it was recorded by Joe Jones in 1960. “California Sun” was also covered by the Rivieras, peaking at an impressive No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Grohl profusely apologized to the crowd, promising the Foo Fighters would return soon, but fans only had to wait minutes instead of months. After being treated offstage and fitted with a cast, Grohl appeared onstage once again, playing with the Foos in a chair and on crutches.

It’s something metal bands have been inspired by for generations and, in our opinion, these are the 10 songs that embody sadness at its very zenith. Even when writing songs about his cat, Peter Steele could tap into sadness like few others. With songs like “Red Water,” “Everything Dies” and “Everyone I Love is Dead” in Type O Negative’s discography, it was tough to pick just one track, but we went with the 11-minute “Bloody Kisses.” Frankly, the track drags you down and keeps you there for an almost unbearable length of time. If Motorhead’s “1916” can’t make you cry, you certainly have no soul. The song tells the story of troops on the front lines during WWI. Lyrics like, “I heard my friend cry, and he sank to his knees / Coughing blood as he screamed for his mother,” is not for the weak of heart and we wouldn’t recommend too many repeat listens in one day. One of metal’s saddest days was when guitar legend Dimebag Darrell was gunned down onstage during a Damageplan show.

Most musicians went along with the “live performance,” but a handful were ballsy enough to take the piss out of those shows while millions watched at home. When it comes to rebellion, no need to look any further than punk rock. During the late ’70s and early ’80s, the punk explosion was still hot, allowing underground acts access to a national platform. Bands like Public Image Ltd, Iggy Pop and Dead Kennedys offered ridiculous sets, but none beat the Stranglers on Top of the Pops. Before completely destroying the TV set, the British punks completely abandoned the facade of “playing,” and if you look close, you can see Jean-Jacques Burnel mime, “Fuck off all you silly cunts.” Mike Patton delivered one of the funniest lip sync mockeries in history while playing “From Out of Nowhere.” The Faith No More vocalist began trilling his lips and tongue while overacting the more dramatic parts of the song. He even pretended to fellate the mic, doing the old tongue-inside-the-cheek trick.

Filter’s summer banger “Take a Picture” centers mostly around the then out of control drug abuse of singer Richard Patrick, focusing around an incident where he became so wasted on an airplane he began to strip naked. Through those lyrics, Patrick takes a step back to see everything that is going around himself, and makes a decision to end his habits. Lines like “I feel like a newborn” signifying his new turn, and the “picture” he’s asking to be taken is only a distant memory in a new life. Fresh starts don’t all have to be nice and collected, with Hatebreed leading by example on their song “Looking Down the Barrel of Today.” Since the beginning of their career, the band has made their mark with tough love inspirational lyrics. Here, singer Jamey Jasta aims at everyone in sight who’s ever doubted him, promising he will never let himself fall into a previous pattern of weakness. He values the strength he knows he’s capable of, and begins anew with no doubt in mind. From the outset, Alice in Chains’ “Killer Is Me” seems like a violent affair based on its lyrics. However, the severity of the language used instead helps to add poignancy to its main turning point. When Layne Staley asks “Can I start over?” It closes out a memorable MTV Unplugged session, adding acoustic flair to the rest of the group’s grungy sound. Blink-182 take aim at friendships that aren’t much beneath the surface in their Dude Ranch cut “Lemmings.” The song takes a tour of singer Mark Hoppus’ teenage years, across the many things he and his friends used to get engaged in. He can find the positives of those experiences, and yet knows that he had to move beyond them to become a man. It’s both wistful for the past, and knowing that it’s not coming back. The classic hardcore track from the legendary punk band Gorilla Biscuits, “Start Today” is all about the present. Instead of building up plans for the future and putting off all the important things in ones life, the group urges the listener instead to literally start today, and not flinch when it comes to having to put the work in when it comes to getting your act together. Hanging out with all your friends shouldn’t be the focus of your life. Oftentimes, the best part about pop-punk is the ways in which it targets the heart of ones lowest feelings and thoughts. Box Car Racer’s “I Feel So” is a laundry list of the things that made Tom DeLonge feel insecure, highlighting his feelings of powerless in the greater scope of the world. It’s him unleashing all the things that drive him crazy, demanding “let’s start over” in its chorus for one of the project’s best songs. Underneath the heaviness of Killswitch Engage’s “Starting Over” is a heartfelt look at a relationship gone awry, and a plea to make things okay once again. Singer Howard Jones admits his fault in a relationship with another person, admitting he fell back on big picture promises and vows he made with another. Heaviness combines succinctly with the emotional energy he puts out, asking with all his heart, “Can we start again?” Judas Priest’s sixteenth album Nostradamus wasn’t the most well received record in the band’s career, but thanks to his many years as a lyricist, Rob Halford managed to deliver some of his best writing in the late album song “New Beginnings.” The concept album tells the story of Nostradamus, but the song tells a very real story about the rejuvenating effects that love can have on a person. It’s a new rebirth thanks to that feeling, and it’s one of the band’s most beautiful and sincere. Thirty Seconds to Mars’ uplifting, electronic infused “Do or Die” is singer Jared Leto directing his words at another person, and at himself. It’s a plea to not take opportunities in life for granted, something that somebody with as much star power as him views as an important lesson to take to heart. The song takes care never to focus on what was in the past, instead making the now stretch onto an eternity, something like heaven, to take chances in life and live with no regret.

For the purposes of this list, we're retroactively giving Metallica credit for crystallizing the style’s core sonic ingredients on 1983’s Kill ‘em All. Everything here predates that album. Now, not everyone will agree that that particular record should represent thrash’s ""day one,"" but you have to start somewhere -- just as we metal-heads often choose to start heavy metal’s history with Black Sabbath because they fused countless preceding experiments into an unprecedented, consistently forceful sound. That sound, as we all know, was also dominated by slow tempos at first, except for rare galloping passages and the odd faster number like “Paranoid,” and years would pass before enough groups shifted into faster gears, warranting a separate designation – “speed metal"" -- which eventually influenced thrash. Here, then, is a list key tracks that introduced thrash-like ingredients to heavy metal before thrash became “a thing.” The list consists of several expected, familiar faces, but also a few surprises that, while certainly subjective (as all things are), paints a fascinatingly frantic story in the era before thrash.

121,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-speed-metal-songs-that-pioneered-thrash-watch/,"Thrash rejuvenated metal in the '80s, but who were the bands that led to thrash?  On this Loud List, we'll look at the roots of the subgenre: from the early ‘70s to just months before Metallica unleashed Kill ‘Em All, these are the songs which formed the thrash blueprint. We’re starting with Deep Purple’s “Speed King.” On the Deep Purple in Rock opener, each member of Purple was chugging at full tilt while remaining impeccably tight. We're also including a lesser known act, Night Sun, who were a tad ahead of their time. The band’s 1972 Mournin’ album manifested various heavy metal styles that would later become popular, including thrash. Easily one of the fastest proto-metal songs at the time, “Nightmare” is a blur that still holds up as a solid piece today. Scorpions have gone in countless stylistic directions throughout their career, but it’s possible that no song sounded more like Metallica before Metallica existed than “He’s a Woman, She’s a Man.” The instrumental work on “He’s a Woman” sounds like something off Master of Puppets, but it was released a decade before the thrash masterwork hit shelves. Take a listen and absorb the aggressive thrash chugging before the genre blew metal up in the ‘80s. Check out these 10 Speed Metal Songs That Pioneered Thrash in the Loud List above.

One insane instance occurred at one of Slash’s solo shows. While playing his iconic “Sweet Child O’ Mine” solo, a fan rushed Slash from behind, seemingly coming from the backstage area. As security went into hot pursuit and tackled the overzealous fan straight into the photo pit. Slash was knocked askew by the tackle, but picked his guitar back up like a pro. The most ridiculous security vs. fan interaction fittingly took place at a Rammstein concert. With the German band’s stage spreading out into the crowd, one concertgoer tried climbing a platform to join Rammstein’s BDSM slave walk. Like a scene out of American Gladiators, one guard treated the platform like monkey bars and dragged the fan down into the depths of Hell. What kind of moron pushes a musician while they’re playing?

There's the fleeting exception, of course, but supergroups have flopped with such frequency that the label has become mostly self-defeating. Remember the VH1 program Supergroup where they thrust Sebastian Bach (Skid Row), Scott Ian (Anthrax), Ted Nugent, Evan Seinfeld (Biohazard) and Jason Bonham (Foreigner) into a lavishly decorated house and forced them to write together? The result was Damnocracy, a short-lived act that seemed consistently lost throughout the series.

Throughout history, different countries or even cities have become concentrated incubators for different kinds of music, and heavy metal is no exception. Throughout the '70s, a majority of the world’s mostly successful and influential metal bands hailed from the U.K.; then, in the ‘80s, American hair metal took the world by storm; later on, distinct movements took root in specific countries, like death metal in Sweden or black metal in Norway. But when it came to ‘80s thrash, there was but one country capable of challenging America’s supremacy, and that was Germany, home to crucial contributors like Kreator, Sodom, Destruction and many more. So many more, in fact, that it wasn’t long before this national phenomenon was given its own denomination – Teutonic Thrash* – and credited with spearheading the music’s evolution towards future offshoots of metallic extremity.

126,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-chad-gray/,"Chad Gray, lead vocalist of Mudvayne and Hellyeah, turns the big 4-0 today! He's a prolific and respected vocalist, doing time in two bands. An admitted ""hustler,"" Gray has adopted the ""I'll sleep when I'm dead"" mentality and he once said that he doesn't want to be onstage barking songs like 'Dig' or 'Hellyeah' when he is 60. That's 20 years from now, so we can still expect to enjoy the singer's dynamic voice on stage for a bit longer. Overall, Gray is an unassuming and reluctant rock star. He's not chasing the fame, even though he's enjoyed platinum success. He's just a regular dude with the noble goal of making quality music. In celebration of Gray's milestone birthday, we're presenting 10 things you may or may not know about him: Before forming Hellyeah with Mudvayne guitarist Greg Tribbett, former Nothingface guitarist Tom Maxwell, Damageplan basssist Bob Zilla and drummer Vinnie Paul (of Pantera fame), Gray and Maxwell were working on a project called Coldwhitechrist. Unfortunately, his Mudvayne obligations at the time prevented him from being the vocalist of the band, which never truly got off the ground.  Gray and guitarist Greg Tribbett are partners in Mudvayne, Hellyeah and beyond! They have teamed up to work in the studio with bands, and one recent project found them co-writing and co-producing the song 'Victim' by Man Made Machine from Phoenix. MMM's debut album 'Become' is out now.  Gray and Tribbett also did some knob twiddling for neo-metal band Nonpoint, producing their sixth album 'Miracle.' Gray also lent his vinegary vocals to the title track. The singer has said that he is more interested in that side of the business and thoroughly enjoys helping bands craft their songs. Gray was quite close to his grandmother Betty Rau, having written the song 'Death Blooms' from Mudvayne's debut album 'L.D. 50' about her. He felt that she was being neglected as she neared her final days on earth and was moved enough to memorialize her in the song.  His nickname when Mudvayne first burst onto the scene in the '00s was ""Kud."" Or ""Chüd."" He has also been referred to as ""Helvis."" You can see his name stitched onto his work shirt during this interview.  How very blue collar of him. Hellyeah dole out meat and potatoes hard rock for the average blue collar, redblooded American, something Gray takes pride in. During a live studio chat with AOL Noisecreep's Creep Show (hosted by this writer), he acknowledged that fans look to Hellyeah as an indulgence and escape. ""People need this,"" he said. ""I'm not making a political statement. People deal with that s--- every day. We're giving people a relief... a night where they are not worried about the house payment or car payment. It's a little self indulgence. When they see us on the calendar, that we're coming to town, they think, 'F--- it all. Let's go out and have a kick ass time.'""  His aforementioned grandmother was clearly a profound influence on her grandson's life. She actually raised him and he used to perform in the local choir because of her. She must be smiling down on him, as he has gone on to become one of the biggest hard rockers of the '00s. He once worked in a Firestone tire factory, making $40,000 per year. It was the same facility that produced faulty tires that were used on Ford Explorers, and caused the vehicles to roll! He also told the Peoria Journal Star (courtesy of Blabbermouth) that, ""I had a job that paid good money and I basically wasn't living my life, you know, I wasn't following the dream in my heart. I basically quit a $40,000-a-year factory job and moved to Peoria. In typical kid fashion, I didn't have one dime of savings, spent it on the stupidest crap ever, you know, bubble gum and pinwheels and beer."" Most bands, metal or otherwise, would sever limbs to attend the Grammys. But not Gray. He wasn't feeling the pomp and circumstance when he attended the posh ceremony in 2006; he went since Mudvayne were nominated for Best Metal Performance for 'Determined' and admitted to experiencing discomfort at music's biggest, pat-itself-on-the-back night. ""Bit of a fish out of water, you know what I mean?"" he said about his emotions that night. ""It's not really my deal, but we're glad to be a part of it, we're glad to be recognized for what we do, and that's amazing."" Mudvayne didn't take home the Grammy gold that night; they lost to Slipknot. Remember how we said Gray is unassuming and a reluctant rock star? Well, he refuses to apply that loaded term to his life and career. He forgoes the trappings of rock stardom and excess, such as fast cars and a crib in the Hollywood Hills in favor of a truck and a rancher!  He told KNAC, ""No, I'm not a rock star. A rock star has a Ferrari in a garage at his mansion. I'm a touring musician. I have a pickup truck, I have a ranch house. I work my ass off. I play in two bands."" Chad Gray has been quite the busy musician over the past decade or so. With that in mind, there must be a few gems about the hard rock singer that we missed in this list.

The veteran rocker has been a popular figure in the metal world for 30 years. His notorious ousting from Metallica resulted in his formation of his own legendary metal act, Megadeth. This year, his band is as active and relevant as ever, as they tour as part of the Big 4 lineup and prepare to release their 13th album, 'TH1RT3EN,' in November. Here, through a series of Mustaine's quotes from various interviews, we celebrate the life and career of this metal veteran with the following list of 10 Things You Didn't Know About Dave Mustaine: ""[Interviews] don't bother me, man,"" he told KNAC. ""It’s what I live for. I actually enjoy meeting people and talking ... as long as I don’t get into talking about something negative, I pretty much enjoy myself."" ""I liked the way [guitar playing] looked, and it was interesting to me,"" he explained to Guitar World. ""I was a curious kid, and it made noise. I had a sister who played piano, who was terrible. I realized the better I was at guitar that I could drown out her dreadful noise."" ""I had radial neuropathy happen to my left arm,"" he said. ""I had been sitting in a chair [with] my arm around the back of the chair, being a lounge lizard. I fell asleep, and the inside of my bicep, the nerve circles your arm. There’s a little notch that the nerve sits in. it was above the bone, and it got pressed against the bone, crushed. It took me four months for the nerve to talk to the arm again."" ""We broke up in March 2002,"" he told Ear Candy Magazine. ""I was going to do a Dave Mustaine record, and the publishing company said that I owed them another Megadeth record. I had to give that to them first."" ""I have a really great cardio program,"" he told Ask Men. ""I’m doing a lot of free weights, a lot of techniques that are modern. The P90X program from Tony Horton ... I take that with me on the road, and it’s got great programs that you can do the DVDs individually. I like the stretching program, I like their yoga program, I like the kickboxing one."" ""One of the most important things for us to do is just come together as people,"" he explained to Lick Library. ""When you’re on stage and you’re playing – without sounding gross – it’s the closest four [guys] can get without actually having sex with each other. You can’t really get closer to a guy to play music with him. It is really that spiritual. What we try to do before we go on stage is just get together, get grounded [and] play [our instruments] a little bit."" ""I used to go watch the funny cars,"" he told Ask Men last year. ""One of the things that I did because I was a little street urchin -- you gotta remember that I grew up like Oliver Twist and I had to take care of things myself -- I was out at the race track, I spent the last $20 I had to my name, bought a ticket, and as soon as I could get in I ran out the other side of the racetrack. I had my hand stamped ... and I learned how to draw the stamp on peoples’ hands and that’s how I made my money, sneaking people in there all day."" ""I took two vocal lessons, but I wont tell you their names,"" he told Hard Rock Haven in 2010. ""One was a 70 year old woman in Hollywood who stood behind me and stuck her hands down my pants. I thought, you know, this is f---ed up. Then there was another one by a guy in Hollywood who asked me to unbutton my pants so he could examine my diaphragm. I said 'Dude, my diaphragm is up here. Diaphragms in pants belong in females.' So I’m not sure what my private parts have to do with a vocal lesson but I guess it’s got something to do with breathing. It was really too weird for me, I thought, if this is part of being a vocalist, I’ll be a professional yeller."" ""I have rank in three different martial arts styles,"" Mustaine revealed. ""I kind of like to play golf, but golf isn’t a metal sport, beating the hell out of the ball is, so I enjoy that part. My kid used to play hockey, and I helped coach him a little bit, but I was never a great player. My hobby right now is just martial arts.""  Mustaine told Metal Injection last year about his ties to important figures in the U.S. government. ""I've been invited to the White House; I've been invited to the Pentagon,"" he said. ""I've got friends in the Secret Service and the FBI."" So, if you learn one thing from this list, don't mess with Dave Mustaine!

128,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-dimebag-darrell-abbott/,"Guitarist Darrell 'Dimebag' Abbott left a monstrous hole in the hearts of many when we lost him on Dec. 8, 2004. Gunned down while his band Damageplan performed at Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio, he was taken from the world far too soon. We take a moment to remember his raw talent, his voracious love for music, and his unrelenting dedication to his family, friends and fans. In celebration of the legendary Pantera guitarist, we present you with a list of 10 Things You Didn't Know About ""Dimebag"" Darrell Abbott: Dimebag’s dad was country & western songwriter/producer Jerry Abbott. Dimebag often spent time watching his father in the studio and soaking it all in, which served as inspiration for the musical path he would travel. Later on in his career, he and his brother Vinnie would collaborate with David Allen Coe on a country, bluesy, rock hybrid project called Rebel Meets Rebel. Dimebag’s first instrument incredibly enough was not the guitar; he started out behind a drum kit. As his brother Vinnie started excelling on the skins, Dime made the switch to guitar and started busting out Boston and Deep Purple riffs. The rest, as they say, is history. In 1981, Dimebag and Vinnie would put together their first band, Pantera's Metal Magic; through years of evolution, the band would become the legendary heavy metal band Pantera. Dime was the recipient of what would become two of his favorite guitars all on one fateful day. Shortly before a local competition, Dimebag’s Dad gave him a Dean Standard with a cherry-burst finish. Dime went on to win the competition. Shortly after, Dime was banned from playing in the competitions because of his advanced skills. Can you say ""sore losers?"" The prize for winning the competition was a Dean ML that Dime eventually sold to his friend Buddy Blaze. Blaze gave it a paint job and it's iconic lightning bolt and eventually returned it to Dime. Along with a few bottles of his beloved Crown Royal, Dime was buried with one of Eddie Van Halen’s historic guitars. Eddie offered up the original 1979 black and yellow Bumblebee Charvel Hybrid VH2 guitar that was featured on the inside of the ‘Van Halen II’ album. According to EVH, “Dime was an original and only an original deserves the original!” Despite his gruff exterior, friends, fans and fellow musicians continue to recount their personal stories on the kindhearted, genuine person that Dimebag was at his core. According to Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian, “Once you shared drinks with that guy, you became a part of his extended family.” He went on to say,“He really did put his family and friends first, and for him, everyone was his family.” Even though Dime inspired and continues to inspire guitarists across the globe, he was also a passionate music fan at heart, so much so that he had one of his biggest influences tattooed on his chest. The tattoo featured a Kiss-era Ace Frehley and is autographed by the Spaceman himself. True to his spirit, Dime also contributed to two Ace Frehley tribute albums throughout the years. Dime was also buried in a Kiss Kasket, per his request. Dime contributed to an ongoing column in Guitar World magazine, offering up his advice on everything from what songs to practice as a new guitarist to tips on harmonics. In 2003, the series was turned into a book titled ‘Guitar World Presents: Dimebag Darrell’s Riffer Madness,’ which compiled all the columns served up in true Dime style. The columns taught some of the techniques that Dime used to create his signature groundbreaking Pantera sound. ‘Riffer Madness’ is now available on DVD, as well. In 1999, when the Dallas Stars won the Stanley Cup, Dime’s brother Vinnie held a party at his house to celebrate. The party was attended by many of the team members who Vinnie and Dime had become friends with. Rumor has it that at one point in the evening, a player took the Cup up to the balcony and threw it towards the pool, but missed. The illustrious Cup suffered a bit of a dent and a silversmith had to be called in immediately to repair it. Members of the Stars have denied this ever happening, but judging by the Abbott brothers' love for a good party, we’re believers. Dime is credited with creating the official drink for Pantera, called the 'Black Tooth Grin.' His drink of choice contained a large shot of Seagrams 7, a large shot of Crown Royal (that’s two shots of whiskey if you’re keeping track) and just a splash of Coke. The name, of course, was borrowed from lyrics from the Megadeth song ‘Sweating Bullets.’ Dime and his soul mate Rita Haney had been together since the third grade. Their love ran deep. In 2010, she helped organized 'Dimebash' in his honor to bring Dime’s friends and fans together to celebrate his legacy. The night included performances and all-star jam sessions with the likes of Dave Grohl, Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Zombie, Slipknot, Shinedown, Slayer and more. Dimebag remains one of the most loved and respected guitarists of our generation. It is with both fondness and sadness that we remember his legacy and honor his contribution to music. It seems that tons of fans have personal stories about Dime or recollections of how his music touched their lives. What are some cool things about Dimebag that you can share with us?

129,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-toxicity/,"On Sept. 4, 2001, System of a Down unleashed their sophomore album, 'Toxicity.' The disc, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart, took the hard-rock and metal worlds by storm with a tour de force of explosive songs, including the singles 'Chop Suey!,' 'Toxicity' and 'Aerials.' The epic album combined masterful musicianship with hard-hitting political lyrics that not only challenged societal and governmental issues, but also challenged the minds of music fans. To this day, it remains one of the best rock albums of the 21st century. In celebration of the landmark disc, Loudwire presents the following list of 10 Things You Didn't Know About 'Toxicity': 'Prison Song,' the opening track on 'Toxicity,' is a tune that rails against the number of people who are incarcerated in prisons across America. It admonishes the government for locking up minor drug offenders. Perhaps, System really wanted to get their point across by including the word ""prison"" 33 times in the lyrics, and that doesn't even include two uses of the plural ""prisons."" While SOAD's self-tiled debut album took three years to sell 1 million copies, 'Toxicity' hit that total in just six weeks. In an interview with his old high-school newspaper, guitarist Daron Malakian said of the 'Toxicity' sales, ""If people say System is a sell out because we've sold millions of albums, they're wrong. I can't control how many CDs we sell or how popular we become."" One of the catchiest songs on 'Toxicity' is 'ATWA,' a tune that combines beautifully melodic verses with an intensely chaotic chorus. The acronym stands for 'Air, Trees, Water, Animals' or 'All the Way Alive,' and was used by Charles Manson and his associates as a term to promote the unity of life on Earth through nature. Forty songs were written for 'Toxicity,' with 33 being fully recorded. The final track list included 14 songs, with many of the unused tracks leaking onto the Internet under the unofficial name 'Toxicity II.' Those additional cuts would later make up the majority of System of a Down's follow-up disc, the appropriately titled 'Steal This Album!' The three official singles from 'Toxicity' all climbed into the Top 10 of Billboard's Modern Rock Chart, with 'Chop Suey!' reaching No. 7, 'Toxicity' peaking at No. 3 and 'Aerials' taking the top spot. In addition, 'Aerials' also topped the Mainstream Rock Chart, making it SOAD's only song to top that tally to date. Singer Serj Tankian wrote lyrics to every song on 'Toxicity,' with guitarist Daron Malakian co-writing the words to six of the tunes, including 'Chop Suey!' and 'Aerials.' Malakian, however, wrote most of the music on the album. On their subsequent albums 'Mezmerize' and 'Hypnotize,' Malakian contributed most of the lyric writing. While 'Toxicity' came out on Sept. 4, it's first-week sales of 220,000 units led the disc to top the Billboard 200 chart the same week as the tragic events of 9/11. The timing added more controversy to the band's rallying cry against various government policies on songs throughout 'Toxicity.' In Spin magazine's year-end issue, 'Toxicity' came in at No. 1 on the publication's list of the best albums of 2001. The disc beat out albums from Radiohead, Bob Dylan, the Strokes and Tool, among others. 'Toxicity' also ranked No. 9 on Alternative Press' list of the 25 Best Albums of 2001. SOAD originally had 'Suicide' as the title of 'Chop Suey!,' the first single from 'Toxicity.' In fact, the words ""We're rolling 'Suicide'"" can be heard in the song's opening seconds on select pressings of the album. Despite the name change, the song was still taken off of radio by many stations because of sensitivity surrounding the 9/11 attacks at the time. While 'Chop Suey!' was nominated for Best Metal Performance for the 2002 Grammy Awards, 'Aerials' earned a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance the following year. Malakian says the band turned down the chance to perform 'Aerials' at the 2003 Grammys, insisting at the time, ""That's something N*SYNC and Britney Spears do, not System of a Down."" System of a Down's 'Toxicity' is a modern classic in terms of hard rock and metal albums. With so many great tracks on the disc, what 'Toxicity' song is your favorite?

130,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-times-black-metal-was-actually-terrifying/,"We recently made a Loud List of 10 Ridiculous Black Metal Moments, highlighting the unquestionably silly side of metal’s coldest genre. Now, we take a look at the darker side of black metal, where the genre’s most violent, blasphemous and sadistic musicians reside. The smile… it’s one of black metal’s most infamous moments caught on tape. When Burzum’s Varg Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison for the murder of Mayhem guitarist Euronymous, Vikernes didn’t burst into tears or bury his head into his hands. Instead, he turned to a camera in the courtroom and smiled. To call this moment iconic seems a little morbid, but in the world of black metal, it’s wholly accurate. “Satan.” With one word in Metal: A Headbanger’s Journey, Gorgoroth vocalist Gaahl became immortalized as the face of modern black metal. It’s the standout moment from Sam Dunn’s excellent documentary and one of the most quotable lines in heavy metal history right with Dave Mustaine’s “Metal up your ass!” Nattramn from Silencer is the focus of multiple black metal urban legends, but one that may actually be true is the alleged assault of a five-year-old girl with an axe. As the story goes, Nattramn missed killing the girl by mere millimeters and tried to commit suicide-by-cop after the attack. After being arrested, he was brought to a psychiatric ward, where he spent the next five years of his life.

131,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-times-johnny-rotten-outclassed-interviewers/,"Sex Pistols / Public Image Ltd legend Johnny Rotten (John Lydon) has provided some of the most entertaining interview moments of the last 40 years. As with many rebellious rock stars, interviewers sometimes misinterpret Rotten’s rough-around-the-edges personality as empty-headedness, but Lydon has proven them wrong time after time. One of Lydon’s most uncomfortable interviews was with Tom Snyder in 1980. Along with PiL bandmate Keith Levene, Johnny batted away many of Synder’s questions, preferring to address PiL as a company rather than a band. The concept didn’t quite stick with Snyder, but the rotten one really gave the host something to wrap his head around when discussing the need for rock and roll to die. Another Public Image joust occurred on Britain’s Check It Out program. An English punk band called the Angelic Upstarts had publicly called Johnny Rotten a sellout for his work with PiL. Rotten refused to take the bait, dismissing both the “sellout” remark and the interviewer’s persistence. The TV presenter began to get passive aggressive with Johnny, resulting in a walk-out from the singer with his dignity firmly intact. We’d be remiss to ignore the Sex Pistols’ infamous Grundy interview when the first pre-watershed “fuck” was broadcast on TV thanks to the Pistols. Host Bill Grundy was immediately combative with the punks and their entourage, and when Rotten uttered the word “shit” under his breath while taking the piss out of Grundy’s classical music taste, the host challenged Johnny to say it again. Never one to back down, Rotten checkmated Grundy in an interview which began the downfall of the presenter’s career.

132,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-times-kids-played-rock-stars-in-music-videos/,"With Pop Evil releasing their “Be Legendary” music video on Valentine’s Day, we started thinking about the history of kids playing rock stars on film. So you can thank “Be Legendary” — Pop Evil’s 11th straight Top 10 single on the Active Rock chart — for this Loud List. Like any decent throwback, Pop Evil’s new video takes place in the 1980s, with the kids listening to cassette tapes and playing arcade games. In “Be Legendary,” the Pop Evil video game is an ode to Street Fighter, with two kids battling against each other to attain pre-teen supremacy. Some of these other clips are a bit more sentimental, like Black Label Society’s video for “In This River.” The Dimebag Darrell tribute ballad can bring any hardened biker to tears, depicting Dime and Zakk Wylde together as kids riding their bikes and heading out on adventures. It’s a beautiful tribute to a good friend gone too soon, and the kids sporting each rocker’s style adds a little hilarity to the otherwise heart-wrenching clip. Who could forget the first time Papa Emeritus III debuted in a Ghost music video? After years of waiting for the next papal incarnation to arrive, Ghost pulled a bait-and-switch by casting a child actor in “Cirice” instead of Tobias Forge. Like the song, the “Cirice” video is a modern classic, depicting a young Satanist talent show with an embryonic version of Ghost enchanting their crowd.

133,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-times-marilyn-manson-outclassed-interviewers/,"Underestimating Marilyn Manson is a deadly mistake. Though many dismissed him as a mindless shock rocker, Manson is, in fact, one of the most well spoken and intelligent musicians in the rock realm. Always ready for a stoic debate, Manson came out on the winning end of these 10 interviews. One of Manson’s most famous interviews comes from Fox News. On The O’Reilly Factor, Manson was challenged again and again by Bill O’Reilly about profanity, outrageous stage antics and his unique appearance. Though he was in the hot seat, Manson remained composed, ultimately beating the conservative host in a game of verbal chess. The term “outclassed” can also be utilized for Manson’s 2002 appearance on The Howard Stern Show. Stern brought in a female Manson fan who wanted the Antichrist Superstar to take her virginity. Howard Stern put pressure on Manson to go through with it, but the musician took the high road, treating the fan respectfully and putting her at ease. While Stern did his schtick, Marilyn grabbed the girl’s hand, giving her the thrill of her life without sending out the slightest of creep vibes. Manson often outclasses interviewers by how he responds to hack questions. When asked about himself and Rose McGowan becoming the new Hollywood “it” couple, Manson replied by explaining how he criticized that very mindset on “The Dope Show.” In a separate red carpet interview, Manson was asked about his pet peeves. Dismissing the question, MM talked about his pet cats instead.

134,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-times-marilyn-manson-was-protested-against/,"Few, if any, musicians have stirred up more controversy than Marilyn Manson. He was public enemy No. 1 in the late ‘90s, and although he gets less press than he used to, protestors still picket outside the Antichrist Superstar’s shows to this day. 1997 was the peak year for Manson outrage. The Antichrist Superstar album pushed every button with America’s Christian groups, with essentially every Manson show attracting protestors. Many Christians believed Manson to be legitimately Satanic, so prayer circles would gather in states like Mississippi when a concert was scheduled. In Oklahoma, Christian rock concerts were even scheduled in close proximity to Manson shows in hopes to lure fans away. After the Columbine massacre, many citizens in Colorado didn’t want artists like Marilyn Manson and Eminem coming to their state, having blamed them for encouraging violent behavior like the shooting. As documented in Michael Moore’s Bowling for Columbine, a group protested Ozzfest 2001, which stopped by Colorado with Manson in the bill. The U.S. isn’t the only hub for Manson protests. In this video, you’ll see demonstrations from Scotland and Russia. The leader of the Scottish protest got up close and personal with Manson fans, resulting in some back-and-forth screaming. In Russia, a group actually threw eggs at Marilyn Manson’s band as they were leaving a hotel. You’ll see that footage above.

Along the way, many interviewers have been preyed upon as he amuses himself, and in turn all of us, with his curious responses, as you'll see in this latest Loud List. One interviewer says he plays in a rock 'n' roll band, playing three chords. ""It's very easy,"" he remarks, asking Maynard if it's the same for him. Flipping the interview, he begins asking the interviewer questions, inquiring how his band is doing. Spoiler: not that great. Even Joe Rogan, who welcomed the singer on his podcast, felt the heat. His cohort, Brian Redban, lobs some obvious and mundane questions Keenan's way, which is grounds for some trolling. Asked if he's ever done hallucinogenics, his stonefaced reply is a rigid ""No."" Then a question about Tool's music not being on iTunes is brought up, something that the singer has likely fielded hundreds of times before, but Redban's situational awareness spikes and he realizes he's been a noob. If you're wondering if there is anyone Keenan won't troll, the answer is another stonedfaced, rigid ""No."" Even a little girl falls victim to his shenanigans when she asks if he's ever seen something in the audience that's made him laugh.

136,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-times-musicians-walked-out-of-interviews/,"Interviews don’t always go as planned and there have been plenty of awkward moments between musicians and journalists throughout rock history. However, this list features an extremely rare interview phenomenon — the walk-out! We’ve interviewed hundreds of musicians over the years, but nobody has ever walked out on us (well, except one, who we'll leave unnamed). You think we’d be thrilled about this, but interview walk-outs become iconic moments in the entertainment landscape! Everyone loves seeing an entertainer storm out of an uncomfortable situation and Sex Pistols / Public Image Ltd. frontman Johnny Rotten has one of the best walk-outs in history. After being shown a tape of the Angelic Upstarts calling Johnny a sellout, the singer affirmed that he didn’t need to explain himself to anyone. After the hosts of British TV show Check it Out kept pressing with the band’s comments against him, Johnny called the segment “a cheapskate comedy interrogation act” before dropping the f-bomb and taking his leave from the set. The rest of PiL was soon to follow. If you’re a fan of music interviews, you’ve gotta be a fan of Canadian journalist Nardwuar as well. He’s been rockin’ in the free world for 30 years, talking to some of music’s most iconic acts. During Slipknot’s Vol. 3 era, Nardwuar spoke with Shawn 'Clown' Crahan and Chris Fehn backstage.

Whether you’re messing with kids on Call of Duty, turning an unsuspecting soul into a timeless meme, or simply being Eric Andre, trolling has become an art form and even a career for some! Our unofficial Loudwire Award of red carpet trolling goes to… Mastodon! The metal giants were nominated for a Grammy Award in 2015 for “High Road” and they actually attended the ceremony. Well, until guitarist Brent Hinds got kicked out. Before his exit, Hinds and drummer Brann Dailor walked the red carpet in an L.A. Dodgers uniform and a “birthday suit,” respectively. The line of the night happened when a female reporter asked Hinds if he hit many home runs, to which Hinds responded, “I only hit home runs, darling.” The following year, Ghost claimed Grammys red carpet trolling supremacy. Having been nominated, and later winning, for “Cirice,” Papa Emeritus III and his nameless ghouls made their presence known. During the band’s interview, a ghoul advised those watching to “stay away from the Grammys.” Papa III, however, spent most of his time trying to seduce a reporter with his Satanic charm. Long before “trolling” was an Internet term, Courtney Love was already a master. In one of the most iconic moments in MTV VMAs history, Love interrupted a 1995 Madonna interview by throwing her shoe at the pop star.

138,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-times-we-were-wowed-by-chester-benningtons-vocals/,"Today, March 20, would have been Chester Bennington's 42nd birthday. The Linkin Park singer shockingly took his own life last summer and the music world lost not only a great talent, but a warm and giving personality as well. Throughout the years, Linkin Park's music helped many through rough times in their life, with Chester's voice having the ability to capture and transmit the emotions that many of his fans had been feeling. Having that quality brought many fans to Linkin Park's music and his vocal prowess has not been lost on us. There are many times that his vocals just blew us away. Not only did he have one of the great rock voices, able to power through and deliver the angst felt in the music with full thrust, but he was an underrated melodic vocalist as well, able to pull back and connect with the emotion and provide more intimate moments when called for. Today we look back 10 Times We Were Wowed By Chester Bennington's Vocals. Who remembers the first time you heard Linkin Park? It was likely the band's breakout single, ""One Step Closer,"" and there was no denying the power and intensity that Chester Bennington brought to the track. A new vocal star was discovered with the introduction of ""One Step Closer."" If ""One Step Closer"" caught your attention, you soon became well aware that Chester Bennington was also feeling many of the lyrics he sang with ""Crawling."" Bennington dug deep with this Grammy-winning 'Hybrid Theory' favorite, which spoke of his own personal demons with substance abuse. Though Bennington could deliver the track with ferocity, on the band's final tour he showed how raw of a nerve the song was by stripping it back to its most intimate and vulnerable space. Regardless of arrangement, Bennington always delivered a vocal that stuck with fans long after shows. Go ahead, admit it. You've tried to sing along to Bennington's part in Linkin Park's ""In the End,"" and having done so you likely know just what a feat it is for the vocalist to hold such a powerful note and make it resonate for such a long period. This may be the most perfect blend of Bennington and Mike Shinoda's vocals, but Bennington's backing in the verses give it that something extra. While the power of Bennington's vocals is what initially captured the ear of many Linkin Park fans, the vocalist lets his melodic side show within the verses of ""Numb."" It's a subtle build as the song rolls out, eventually ascending to the power we'd come to expect, but ""Numb"" is one of the songs that best shows Bennington's range of delivery. Though not written by Bennington, ""Breaking the Habit"" is a song that the singer could definitely identify with. He nimbly keeps the melody going over a fairly rapid-fire track, slowly building in intensity to the emotion-ridden chorus, with his ""Breaking the Habit"" getting almost to full scream at times. ""Shadow of the Day"" is one of Bennington's more subdued vocal performances, but the nuance with which he delivers the vocal should definitely be appreciated. It's a slow-building song that relies heavily on Bennington's vocal to set the tone, first taking the listener through a more melancholy vibe before eventually making a subtle transition to a more hopeful feel. Is there any limit to Bennington's range? You start to feel on ""Given Up"" that the singer is reaching it. The verses feel a little rough, mirroring the vibe of the song, but when the chorus kicks in, so does that power scream of Bennington. But this time, it feels as though he's leaving it all on the recording, pushing the scream as far as it could go. Linkin Park really changed things up with their 2010 single ""Waiting for the End,"" providing a more rhythmic track that just glides over a steady piano-note beat. For one of Bennington's more stellar melodic moments, go back and revisit this gem as Bennington starts almost whisper-restrained before building toward the track's most emotion-filled sentiment: 'I know what it takes to move on / I know how it feels to lie / All I wanna do is trade this life for something new / Holding onto what I haven't got."" When the beat gets pumping, it's sometimes hard not to get pulled into the mesmerizing groove. And this Linkin Park collaboration with Steve Aoki definitely has an undeniably dance-y feel. But even with your feet tapping, you're not going to miss Chester Bennington's vocal in ""A Light That Never Comes."" As the shift transitions from Shinoda's rap to Bennington's vocal, the music pulls back a bit to let Bennington take center stage, as he reaches for his upper register. The singer hits his mark with the lyric, then offers a catchy ""uh-oh-uh-oh-ohhhh"" that plays right along with the beat that Aoki's laying down. While we often associate Bennington's voice with power, there may have been no powerful statement that he made as a vocalist with the more subdued and vulnerable title track from the 'One More Light' album. It's an emotional vocal that hits even harder in the wake of Bennington's passing. We've had our say. Now it's time for you to have yours. Which Chester Bennington vocal wows you the most?

Having entertained the world for over 50 years, Alice Cooper is a true original, as you’ll be able to see in this Loud List. Like many hard rock and heavy metal icons, Alice Cooper was inspired to become a musician by the Beatles. As you’ll see in this compilation, Cooper explains how his entire childhood revolved around the church, having been raised by a preacher father. The Beatles completely blew Cooper’s mind, allowing the future rock legend to realize his calling. A multi-talented entertainer, Cooper has been a fixture of pop culture for decades through iconic appearances on Wayne’s World and The Muppets. “We’re not worthy” remains the siren call of Alice Cooper fans to this day thanks to Mike Myers and Dana Carvey’s idol worship moment. As for pure nostalgia, few moments enact feelings of childlike joy like watching Alice Cooper attempting to get Kermit the Frog to sign a contract with the dark lord himself. You’ll also find out about Alice Cooper’s second love — golf! Cooper originally picked up the hobby to keep his mind off alcohol, which he kicked many years ago. Golf became the rock icon’s new vice, so much that he even did a commercial for Gallaway with a special cameo from Cooper’s giant python.

Chuck was wearing a shirt with cats all over it while sipping his coffee, assuring that even death metallers can be animal lovers and oppose cruelty to our furry friends. We’ve integrated performances from Schuldiner’s entire history with Death, going back to 1987 when the extreme pioneers played a dive with a packed crowd. A decade later, Death would record their renowned Live in L.A. (Death & Raw) set, cranking out favorites like “The Philosopher.” We even included one of Chuck’s old Mantas demos from 1984. Our video compilation finishes up with some of Chuck’s words on Heaven, Hell and the afterlife. “I believe this is Hell,” Schuldiner says. “There aren’t demons flying around with horns, people are demons.” As for existence in general, Chuck stated, “I would like to live forever if it was possible.” Chuck would sadly just get a few more years, but his work has immortalized Schuldiner in audio form.

Having written and performed on Metallica’s heaviest and most timeless material, Burton will be forever known as a metal god, thus, we salute the four-string titan with this Loud List. We went deep to pull footage that best showcased Burton’s personality. We even found a super old interview with one of Burton’s first bands, Agents of Misfortune. Taken before a high school battle of the bands, this interview shows Burton as just a local musician unaware of the superstardom that awaited him just a few years later. If there’s one iconic piece of Burton footage, it’s his intro to “For Whom the Bell Tolls” from Day on the Green. The extreme close-up of Burton’s bass while he launches into his signature riff is spellbinding. The distorted and fuzzed out sound really represents Cliff’s attitude on the bass, while his licks around the classic riff just add icing on the thrash cake. We also found an audio interview with Cliff just days before Metallica’s ill-fated bus crash. When asked why Metallica don’t write about happier themes, Burton responded, “We’re not a bunch of really happy people, you know?

143,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-unforgettable-freddie-mercury-moments/,"On Nov. 24, 1991, a true rock and roll icon passed away due to complications from AIDS. A powerhouse voice and once-in-a-lifetime showman was taken far too early at age 45, but we remember Freddie Mercury with these unforgettable moments. We found some pretty early footage of Mercury, including some film from his pre-Queen days. As for the legendary British band, we get into one of their earliest known filmed performances with “Keep Yourself Alive” in 1973. Over a decade later, Queen performed what’s widely considered the greatest set in rock history, gracing the Live Aid stage for under 30 minutes in 1985. Though a fiercely dynamic stage performer, Mercury was also an extremely accomplished pianist, especially when it comes to the percussive and emotional aspects. Listening to Freddie pound the ivories is always a joy, so we threw in a version of “Don’t Stop Me Now” where the musician let his audience sing most of the intro. Freddie was also quite the comedian during interviews. The music press wasn’t always so kind to Queen, so Mercury famously gave one interviewer a hard time. “I love my job, but I hate talking to people like you,” he said sheepishly before cracking a smile. Freddie also wished the very best for his fan base in a separate interview, saying, “I want everyone to get fucked all night, every day, just like I do.” Check out these 10 Unforgettable Freddie Mercury Moments in the Loud List above.

To celebrate the masked musicians, we’ve put together a Loud List of Unforgettable Ghost Moments. Whether led by the chilling Papa Emeritus I, the demonic Papa Emeritus II or the charismatic and youthful Papa Emeritus III, Ghost have been on a hot streak since unveiling Opus Eponymous in 2010. Having become one of metal’s greatest conceptual acts, Ghost took the idea of a Satanic cult with a Pope-like figurehead very seriously, so much that the band had to take a step back in their early days, realizing they needed to completely flesh out the idea before implementing it. Years later, Ghost found themselves on the Grammy Awards red carpet nominated for Best Metal Performance in 2016, which they won. Papa III and his nameless ghouls did some fine trolling on the carpet, with one ghouls saying, “Stay away from the Grammys,” after being asked if there was a message he’d like send back home. Who’s up for some sex education with Papa Emeritus III? During Ghost’s ‘Popestar’ tour, Papa III would regularly take time to sit down and chat with his flock. Directed at the young kids in this crowd, Papa explained the act of coitus by using musical references, which certainly didn’t fly over the heads of the puberty-and-up fans in attendance.

To bid Ville Valo and the boys farewell, we’ve put together these unforgettable moments from the Finnish love metallers. We dug deep for this Loud List, starting with one of the oldest interviews with Ville Valo that we could find. Valo explains that KISS’ Gene Simmons was the reason he became a musician, with Animalize being the first album Ville ever bought. Simmons’ stage antics planted the seed for Ville Valo, especially the “blood and fire” that KISS’ demon would utilize while performing. One of HIM’s first television appearances came in 1996. Thanks to their much celebrated cover of Chris Isaak’s “Wicked Game,” the band was invited onto Jyrki, a show on Finland’s MTV3 channel. HIM didn’t even have a full-length album out at the time, just their 666 Ways to Love: Prologue EP, which features “Wicked Game.” It was obvious HIM was destined for big things, performing like seasoned pros just five years into their career. We had Ville Valo and Mikko ‘Mige’ Paananen in our studio a few years back, with the duo reminiscing about memories from the Viva La Bam days. Though they couldn’t go into detail about the extremities of their party days, they spoke about a common Bam Margera prank — slipping Viagra into people’s drinks.

We brought this video compilation all the way back to the beginning, when Alice in Chains were living in a crummy band house and starving to chase a dream. With Cantrell pouring himself a bowl of SpaghettiOs, the guitarist shared some words about how the best music comes from being down and out. You may remember Alice in Chains’ fun-filled appearance on Headbangers Ball, where host Riki Rachtman took the band to a waterpark. Dressed in only a blue speedo, Cantrell did an interview talking out of a snorkeling mask, proving he had no fear of the giant slide he was about to go down. Before Layne Staley passed away, Cantrell did an interview where he spoke about the singer’s incredible abilities. Calling Staley his “best friend in the world,” Cantrell described how the harmonies Layne came up with being “wrong, but right” and how everything seemed to come completely naturally to the AIC frontman.

Gone too soon at the age of 27, here are some of the most incredible and memorable moments of Hendrix’s life. Out of these “unforgettable moments,” we started our video compilation with a clip you may have never seen before. Previous to Hendrix’s iconic career with the Experience, he was a fairly prolific R&B backing musician, playing for Don Covay, Curtis Knight and McGough & McGear. Hendrix even made his first TV appearance playing guitar for Buddy & Stacy, which you’ll see in this Loud List. Of course, Hendrix’s most iconic guitar moments grace this list, including the almighty rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” his “Hey Joe” teeth solo and lighting his guitar on fire at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. However, we also included a more rare guitar moment, which is one of the only known recordings of Hendrix actually wielding an acoustic. Hendrix participated in some wildly entertaining “home videos,” including one featured in the Rainbow Bridge film. After smoking some weed and partaking in some adult beverages, Jimi went on a hilarious rant after being asked if he’s ever had an out-of-body experience.

Without Johnny Christ, Avenged Sevenfold would be nothing.” Frontman M. Shadows may have said those words while a paintball gun was pointed at his head, but we believe a small part of him meant it. Johnny was a fixture of Avenged’s backstage segments they would show fans 15 minutes before hitting the stage. Whether on the toilet or in the shower, the bassist often found himself in precarious positions while the camera was rolling. Word of advice: If you’re headed to the liquor store to grab some 40s, don’t send Johnny Christ in to get them.

The vocalist’s piercings, colored hair and bizarre persona jumped off the screen and affected everyone who gazed at the man. You’ll see some of his most powerful concert moments in this list, including performances of “Firestarter” and “Breathe.” While speaking with the BBC, Flint described the incredible energy created during Prodigy gigs. “They’re throwing the energy at you, you’re throwing it right back to them,” Flint said. “It’s the most powerful feeling in the world. It’s something that a lot of people just don’t have the opportunity to experience.” Though the Prodigy existed in the EDM world, Flint’s persona inspired punks and metalheads to embrace electronic music. He even gave a boost to System of a Down as they were just starting to blow up, stating, “That crowd feels sort of challenging, mature, they’re not gonna take any shit… you know that if you’re rocking them, you’re doing well.

Of course, cutting this down to just 10 of them was a challenge, but this Loud List places emphasis on all aspects of the band from the stage to deep and personal interviews to, yes, an appearance on the legendary animated sitcom South Park. First, we take it back to 1993, the year Korn was formed. Jonathan Davis, known for showing a little leg onstage with the ever-popular kilt, had a different sense of style back then: short shorts and knee-high striped socks. In just a few years, Korn went from sweaty clubs to global dominance on the back of three hugely successful records. With the nu-metal revolution in full swing, Korn were leading the charge and played to a ravenous crowd at Woodstock '99 just ahead of the release of Issues. The album art for the 1999 record was chosen after pouring through countless fan art submissions, a process we've highlighted in this Loud List. The group's appearance on South Park is heralded as a classic as the episode was a spoof on Scooby-Doo where Korn get caught up in a mystery concerning pirate ghosts and necrophilia before performing to the town's citizens. Anyone familiar with Korn knows all too well that the band has dealt with dark lyrical subject matter and addiction, which come to light in a couple interview videos. There's balance, however, with some fun clips spliced between the serious and more harrowing moments. Watch the video above to see all 10 Unforgettable Korn Moments.

Even hardcore Meshuggah fans may not know that both drummer Tomas Haake and guitarist Fredrik Thordendal suffered serious hand injuries just months apart. Haake still bares scars from a workshop accident, which took off pieces of multiple fingers, ripping off nails as well. As for Thordendal, he got the Tony Iommi treatment, severing a fingertip and leaving his middle finger the same length as his index finger. As for vocalist Jens Kidman, he spoke about the band’s solid relationship during the obZen era. “We have like no fights,” Kidman said. “It would be really hard if Tomas decided to stop playing or I stopped or whoever. To put a new member in there would feel weird, I think we would probably stop playing.” Thankfully, Meshuggah just put out one of the strongest albums of their career, The Violent Sleep of Reason, and show no signs of slowing down.

From his beginning with Dream Theater, to filling in for Avenged Sevenfold and beyond, we compiled these 10 Unforgettable Mike Portnoy Moments. One of the earlier Dream Theater interviews we could find was a Headbanger’s Ball video from 1993. Shortly after the release of Images and Words, Dream Theater spoke to MTV while headlining the Aardschokdag Festival in the Netherlands. After talking about avoiding the trappings of being a “trend band,” Portnoy got a nervous John Petrucci to join him for a Beavis & Butthead impression. One hilarious moment comes from a Dream Theater show, where singer James LaBrie cut an instrumental break early, much to Portnoy’s displeasure. You could see Mike getting hot under the collar about his bandmate’s decision, but instead of causing a scene, Portnoy took it out on his drums, absolutely crushing his kit as Dream Theater said goodbye to their fans. Of course, we had to include Loudwire’s most popular YouTube video ever, Mike Portnoy playing ‘Name That Tune’ on a Hello Kitty drum kit. Portnoy’s powerhouse drumming was far too much for the toy kit to handle, breaking apart on multiple occasions. Mike eventually hit the kick drum so hard that it caved in, rendering the Hello Kitty instrument even more useless than it originally was.

Paul’s drum parts were one of the driving forces behind Pantera. The opening for “Primal Concrete Sledge” is a complete monster, especially live. It showed Pantera at their most rhythmic, with Vinnie essentially taking the lead for the Cowboys From Hell track. We also found some killer footage of Vinnie slamming the double bass part in “Becoming,” which is perhaps the most complex Pantera percussion piece. Vinnie will always be remembered as an incredibly friendly, welcoming and warm man who had an eternal love for music. “I’ve never been married, I don’t have any kids. I’ve always been married to music,” Paul said in a Hellyeah interview. “I keep that really close to my heart and I stay focused all the time. It’s all about being real, playing the music and feeling that power of being part of an army.” We were lucky enough to film a ‘Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?’ segment with Vinnie Paul in 2016.

In this clip, we’ve highlighted 10 up-and-coming bands that may eventually become some of your all-time favorites. Our goal here is simple: turn you on to at least one new act. Some of these bands you’ve certainly heard of before, like Greta Van Fleet and Bad Wolves, who have both scored gigantic hits this year. Though Greta scored 20 million YouTube views for “Highway Song,” they’ve yet to reach their full potential, having not even released a true full-length album. Bad Wolves’ 2018 cover of the Cranberries’ “Zombie” is even more astounding, exceeding 100 million plays on YouTube. Let’s get into the lesser-known acts, who may help lead metal into the future. One such band is Lychgate, a British act who brilliantly melded death metal, church organ, doom and black metal into what could be their breakout release, The Contagion in Nine Steps. If you’re into Opeth, we’d highly recommend Lychgate’s brand of extreme sophistication. If you’re looking for something even more experimental, give New Zealand teenagers Alien Weaponry a try. We exclusively premiered their video for “Kai Tangata” earlier this year and it’s on the brink of surpassing a million views on YouTube. Almost like Sepultura’s Roots, Alien Weaponry took inspiration from their native people, the Maori, to write crushing thrash and groove, and the experiment is paying off.

The ridiculousness of it all makes for a fun listen and a party of a live show, as you’ll see in the clip above. Nobody could have anticipated an act like Babymetal being embraced by the most serious of metalheads, but it happened thanks to top-notch musicianship and compositional prowess along with an undeniable charm. Japanese “idol” groups like Babymetal have been recently categorized as “kawaii metal,” which translates to “cute metal” in English.

It seems like yesterday that some of our favorite musicians were just babyfaced rockers just making a name for themselves. Some of them have aged gracefully. There are also rockers who were well established during the 21st Century's first decade, and while some may show a little more wear after plenty of miles traveled, others somehow have found the secret of youth and don't appear to have aged a day. In honor of the viral How Hard Did Aging Hit You Challenge, we decided to see how some of our favorite artists have aged throughout the years. So join us as we take this pictorial look back with some of your favorite musicians and how they looked during the 2000s as opposed to how they look now.

Tristan is a shining example of this, being born after Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith had rejoined the band and released 'Brave New World' in 2000. This 10-year-old has quite a lot of talent! 'Aces High' is a song full of fleeting guitar work that Iron Maiden made their name on. Tristan, sporting his Maiden soccer jersey, covers this song almost flawlessly, and even manages to nail the two fret-melting solos. Dave Murray and Adrian Smith's solos are of legend, especially in this song, and this kid is just as impressive!

163,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-year-old-drummer-wins-denmarks-got-talent/,"10-year-old drumming prodigy Johanne Astrid Poulsen is the 2017 winner of Denmark’s Got Talent. She rocked her way from the auditions to the final round by jamming classic tracks like Rage Against the Machine’s “Killing in the Name” and Led Zeppelin’s “Whole Lotta Love.” Johanne’s audition came in the form of a medley, where she sent the Denmark’s Got Talent judges into a frenzy after launching into “Killing in the Name.” The young girl’s power and precision was definitely impressive, but it was her performance of “Whole Lotta Love” that proved she’s a serious force behind that kit. The young drummer playing John Bonham’s parts truly shows the depth of her skill. Her work on the cymbals and toms excels far beyond her years, surely making drummers twice or three times her age obscenely jealous. Johanne’s final song for Denmark’s Got Talent was “Bad Craziness” by Danish rock band D-A-D. She didn’t expect to win, according to TV2, but she did, taking home 250,000 Danish kroner (roughly $35,700). “I hope I will get to play a lot of other places or get in a real band. I have not really thought about it, but I just know I have to play drums when I grow up,” says Johanne Astrid. Check out the Denmark’s Got Talent champion jamming “Killing in the Name,” “Whole Lotta Love” and “Bad Craziness” in the video above!

165,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-years-album-artwork-new-release-date-minus-the-machine/,"10 Years give fans a look at their analog-inspired cover for the forthcoming sixth studio album, 'Minus the Machine,' which will hit shelves a few weeks later than planned. The Knoxville, Tenn., hard rock quartet have decided to release their latest effort on their own label, Palehorse Records, marking the first time the band has attempted an independent release since signing to Hollywood Records in 2005. ""We wanted to create an album that has no boundaries,” says singer Jesse Hasek of the decision. “When you feel like you’re being told to go through motions and jump through hoops, it takes the heart out of it. It’s better to do what comes naturally and then figure out the after-effect.” The band re-tweeted an image of the cover art for 'Minus the Machine' -- the jacket prominently features an old-school reel-to-reel machine that bears the bands name on its display. With the revitalized interest in all things analog of late, perhaps the album's title is as much about the recording methods as it is about cutting ties with the ""machine"" that is the record industry. The message also indicated that their album will be out July 31, as opposed to the initial July 17 release date. After a few unaccompanied dates later this month, 10 years are taking their new material on the road with Fair to Midland and KYNG for the 'Minus the Machine' tour beginning June 27. ""We live and die by the loyalty of the club audiences. Our fans are loyal. They travel with us, and they want us to be loyal to ourselves,” says Hasek. “What we tried to do on this album is really give them what they want because they’ve been so good to us through the ups and downs of our career.” 05/19 -- Maryland Heights, MO -- Verizon Wireless Ampitheatre -- Pointfest

166,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-years-backlash-song-review/,"Knoxville, Tennessee's 10 Years are ready to unchain their latest musical concoction, ‘Minus the Machine,’ on July 31, and the guys are going at it on their own via their own label, Palehorse Records. The album’s first single, 'Backlash,' is classic 10 Years, featuring echoey, carefully placed guitar lines that splatter into a thick, dark chorus. The track is set up with a quiet piano passage before launching into insanely heavy guitars and Jesse Hasek’s hushed vocals permeating the verses. The lyrics are poetic in their anguish: “Dear God, will no one get out of here alive? / Well I’ll still have them / This new Madison floating in the sky / Every clouds come crashing down.” As the chorus crashes in, it’s obvious 10 Years is captivated with the big payoff chorus, as the guitars and rhythms crash into a big, melodic whirlwind of post-grunge sounds. “Come by your self righteous hands / Get ready to meet your maker / Now, backlashing, back trash you liar / Backlashing, back dashing run coward,” Hasek croons. ‘Backlash’ is a great example of Hasek’s pleading, flexible vocals, as he shifts from reverberating whispers to full-voiced pleas in seconds. Moreover, the band sounds as tight as ever, perhaps revitalized by the idea of doing things independently. With ‘Backlash,’ 10 Years move away from the purely alt-metal pack with a catchy, melodic post-grunge anthem, returning to the radio dials skillfully and with great distinction.

168,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-years-ghosts-song/,"With an album titled (how to live) As Ghosts, 10 Years definitely pique our interest and conjure up a visual. Now fans can get a little more context to that intriguing title as the group just unleashed an audio clip of the title track ""Ghosts"" from the disc. After starting off with forceful guitars, the song pulls back into a more ethereal sound with Jesse Hasek's hypnotic and more melodic vocal, befitting of the title ""Ghosts."" But while the verses are more subdued, 10 Years pick up the pace in the chorus. ""Stop trying to show / How to save our souls / It takes time to know / How to Live as Ghosts,"" belts Hasek over a more aggressive wall of guitars, later adding, ""You're running through the motions of the emotionless."" All in all, it's a song that finds that perfect blend between heavy aggression and more subdued moments. Meanwhile, the mostly static photo that they've chosen to accompany the audio player of the song features a floating women's silhouette with forested tree tops projected on her body. ""Ghosts"" follows on the heels of their current radio hit, ""Novacaine,"" which has steadily climbed the charts in recent months. The video for the track debuted here at Loudwire earlier this year. Both songs are featured on the (how to live) As Ghosts album, which is on target for an Oct. 27 street date via Mascot.

169,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-years-jesse-hasek-we-get-along-now-better-than-ever/,"10 Years are back with the new album (How to Live) as Ghosts and longtime fans of the band are likely rejoicing about the return of guitarists Brian Vodinh and Matt Wantland. It's been a welcome presence for the band as well, as singer Jesse Hasek reveals in a chat with Loudwire Nights host Toni Gonzalez that things are going well with the pair. Hasek says that he felt that 2015's From Birth to Burial album could have potentially been the band's last effort, but the return of Vodinh and Wantland has the band revitalized. “We’ve got 80 percent of the original band back and with great chemistry and it’s as good as what we had in the beginning,” says the singer. Speaking about Vodinh and Wantland's exits and return, Hasek stated, ""We got together and it took five or six years to get signed and we blew up. Then there becomes tension internally and those two are great writers and they work really well together but as things went on, there were conflicts and this and that. I didn’t know that those guys would ever really want to work together again and to get them back together, it feels right. It’s like an Oreo cookie [laughs]. They make jokes that we talk better through music than we do to each other in conversation.” He continues, “We’re all like a brotherhood and we get along now better than ever, but stuff grows and changes and you have success when you’ve never had success, they try to put a focal point on the singer or try to pick the band apart. That’s why they make so many movies about it. It’s a very common theme. But I think as you grow and you get older you can look back at the stuff and things you thought were a big deal is really petty and you look and think what was the reason you did it to start with? It was for the love of making music with these people. And if you can come back to that, I think there’s always the ability to rekindle and recreate things.” 10 Years will be back on tour in December. See where they're playing at this location.

The clip centers on a young man sitting behind the computer in an endless row of cubicles suddenly transported into a repetitive world, waking up and living out the same day with some of the passersby tipping him off that something is not quite right. Singer Jesse Hasek tells us of the song and video, ""The song 'Novacaine' was inspired by how the repetition of life can numb you no matter how high or low the peaks and valleys are if you keep going through life doing the same thing over and over. The video is like the movie Groundhog Day or the Day After Tomorrow about someone living their life on a loop. The main character seems to have it all materialistically speaking (fancy car, a nice urban loft, and a well-paying job), but he finds himself stuck in a dream living the same day over and over where the same strangers keep telling him 'your dead as dead can be.' If we never get out of our comfort zone or pop our safety bubble, then we're not living life to its full potential."" 10 Years have undergone a lineup change since their last album, welcoming back some familiar faces in the process. Singer Jesse Hasek, drummer Kyle Mayer and bassist (moving over from guitar) Chad Huff are now joined by returning guitarist Matt Wantland and guitarist/drummer Brian Vodinh.

The album has already spawned the hit singles 'Backlash' and 'Dancing With the Dead.' The band is now supporting the title track from the effort. Pop Evil, meanwhile, are just getting back into the flow of things. The band recently revealed that their 'Onyx' album is expected on May 14. It features their quickly-rising new single 'Trenches,' which debuted in late February.

173,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/10-years-singer-jesse-hasek-touring-music-industry-minus-the-machine-more/,"10 Years are known for vigorously touring and they have been on the road nonstop promoting their latest album ‘Minus the Machine.’ Whether they’re headlining or offering support, 10 Years tend to bring it onstage every time.  Prior to their recent gig in New York City, we caught up with the band’s frontman, Jesse Hasek, who talked about touring, changes in the music industry and more. With all of the touring 10 Years has done, do you have any interesting touring stories so far for this year that you can share? Right now, it’s just us getting back into the swing of things, we had a little over a month off and we haven’t been doing any support touring for almost two years. We’ve primarily been doing headlining shows for a long time, so it’s getting back to making a smaller set and getting in front of crowds that might not quite know you. It’s that whole thing of trying to win over new fans. Headlining is a different ball game, we’re allowed to create multiple energy levels. When we do support we have 30 to 45 minutes and it’s just the pedal to the floor because you’re trying to make a moment in that short amount of time. What is one thing that you have learned about this industry from when you first started out to now? Be very aware of your surroundings because in this industry there’s a lot of people that are fancy talkers. There’s a lot of dinners and wining and dining and they’re able to make you feel like they’re your friends but it’s a business. If you don’t keep your eyes open the wolves can consume you for sure. We had some growing pains and learned lessons from ‘Division’ to ‘Feeding the Wolves’ to now. Pretty much ‘Killing All That Holds You’ and ‘The Autumn Effect’ were untainted, we could just do what we wanted to do. When we had success, you have more cooks in the kitchen, you have the label on you more and the sound to be a certain way. That’s why the [2008] record was called ‘Division’ because internally we were being pulled in different directions, integrity versus commercialism. You need both, you need the McCartney and the Lennon, there’s a balance between the two. You don’t go so far with integrity to where you just shoot yourself in the foot and then you don’t go so far with commercialism where you’re shallow and you’re at room temperature. We did learn that the tighter you can make your band and the stronger you can make your band, the better chance you have of surviving. Was this outlook one of the reasons you decided to go independent with Palehorse Records for 'Minus the Machine'? Yeah, that whole departure with Universal – Universal was good to us, they put support behind us for three albums and they did a good job at it. The reason the last album was called ‘Feeding the Wolves’ was because they really put the pressure on us to keep up with whatever was currently popular on rock radio. We didn’t write ‘Wasteland’ because we knew it was a smash hit, we wrote ‘Wasteland’ because it was just a song that all the guys got in the room and created. It was personal for me, the lyrics and most of these songs are personal. When you start trying to put outside writers into our picture and they come in and are like “Okay we’re going to write a love song, or an angst song and this is going to be the title.” I just can’t do it, in this day and age more people do that than not. We played the game as much as we had to play the game on ‘Feeding the Wolves’ just to get a budget and get the record out to get it finished. They knew that we weren’t happy, there’s a lot of that record that I’m really proud of and there were a few spots in there where I was pushed out of my comfort zone. That’s what ultimately led to ‘Minus the Machine’ on Palehorse Records and Universal was cool enough to just let us out. They were like “We want to go more co-write, we want to target the mainstream more” and we’re like “We want to go less actually.” I mean just the way technology is and the internet is, the big major labels are still spending money the way they used to and these poor bands will never see a dime from it. We’ve made more money on our independent record sales than we have all our others like ‘The Autumn Effect’ that sold a half million records. We didn’t see a dime from that because their budgets for things are astronomical and unrealistic in this day and age. With ‘Minus the Machine,’ you recently put out the single ‘Dancing With the Dead.' What's the next song you'll be promoting from the album? We started doing our own DIY style of videos so we’re currently editing a video out for [the title track] ‘Minus the Machine.’ Lyrically with ‘Minus the Machine’  the chorus says “We want the world in the palm of our hands / So incomplete / Minus machine / Dying to know / And control on command / So incomplete / Minus machine” and then it goes “Kill the lights forever.” I’m a little older in the sense that I grew up before the Internet and this technology wave took over. I grew up when you look forward to full albums coming out or you look forward to reading a book or you look forward to going outside as a kid and playing with sticks in the woods or on a playground, building stuff, getting scars, falling down. There’s just screens in front of your face everywhere you go now, your phone is everything and I think if you get consumed by it you miss a lot. It needs to be balanced, technology has perks and there so many great things about it but it can just consume you. Kids are too caught up on all the social media now. What is one thing you must have on tour with you, no electronics? That’s easy, I have a massive box of Sharpies where I do drum heads - the sharpies and sketchpad stuff and my skateboard. I’ve been skateboarding for about 20 years, I still do tricks and try to act like I’m not getting old, no more hand rails. What would you say is the weirdest thing on this tour bus? That’s a good question, we try to keep it clean except there’s dirty show clothes. We have started a new thing as a joke and it actually has its own Instagram page called “Crew Chicken.” It started as a joke, one of the guys friends were supposed to bring me a rotisserie chicken from the store and now it’s evolved into what we call crew chicken and they just end up on the bus. Photos get put up on the bus of different people eating it, us and our crew guys and stuff. So it’s a random rotisserie chicken?  It’s just a random rotisserie chicken on the road that just show up on the bus. The crew chicken is sort of a celebrity with its own Instagram and even a couple of followers.

The U.K.'s Evening Standard reported on the mass theft, including testimonials from fans who had their phones swiped without their knowledge. ""Security told me 50 were stolen and that was only after the first three songs,"" said Daniel Snow, who is now without his Galaxy S8. Taking stock of the response from others who fell victim to the same fate, he said, ""Some people were really angry, a lot were stressed but we were massively upset by it."" As far as to who executed the heist, Snow felt it was the work of multiple people as he commented, ""The gang were clearly organized. Metal fans are a great community. No real fan would do something like this."" Another fan, Conor Burke, went to the venue's lost property section and spent an hour talking with others who had their phones stolen. ""From the people I saw and talked to, and the amount of people coming and going, I’d say there was a minimum of 100 people. It was just ridiculous — it ruined the gig,"" he explained. It was also reported that Roundhouse, the venue, had posted signs warning concertgoers to beware of pickpockets. Upon exit, security searched those in attendance, demanding they unlock the phone in their possession to prove they owned it. Despite the estimate of lost phones being at 100, police have received 14 individual reports of phone theft at or outside of the show.

176,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/11-florida-death-metal-albums-you-need/,"Florida: “The Sunshine State,” or “full of flowers,” in the Spanish tongue of Conquistador, Ponce de Leon, who disrupted the lives of some 350,000 native Americans when he landed there in 1513, seeking the legendary Fountain of Youth. How was he to know he was actually closer to the fountain of DEATH! Death metal, to be precise, began laying down roots as a standalone heavy metal sub-genre in the modern-day state of Florida as a natural sonic evolution of thrash metal, as that genre reached its commercial peak in the hands of Metallica, Slayer and others. Yes, there were similar evolutionary steps being taken around the world – most notably by San Francisco’s Possessed and Sweden’s Nihilist – but few people would dispute the fact that death metal’s primary architect, if there is one, was the Orlando-based Chuck Schuldiner, the driving force behind the aptly named band, Death. And so, with additional input from other fledgling groups formed right there in Mickey Mouse’s backyard, like Obituary, Morbid Angel, Deicide and Atheist, death metal became a cottage industry of sorts, centered around Tampa’s Morrisound Recording Studio and producer Scott Burns. It was here that death metal’s signature sound took shape, infusing thrash with a heavier, thicker, chunkier guitar sound, incremental songwriting complexity, and, most distinctive of all, growled, guttural, melody-scorning vocals. Anyway, looking back now, over a quarter-century later, there’s no refuting the existence of a “Floridian Death Metal Scene,” responsible for so many classic albums, 11 of which we’ll revisit below as the discography no dedicated metalhead should live without.

178,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/11-great-judas-priest-guest-appearances/,"By Bryan Reesman  Between eighteen studio albums, seven Rob Halford studio releases (with Fight, Halford, and 2wo), and two Glenn Tipton solo efforts over the last 44 years, there's already a plethora of Judas Priest-related music in the world. But members of the iconic British group have also managed to squeak out a few cameo appearances on other people's albums. Here are some guest slots from the boys from Birmingham that you may have missed. RELATED: WIN A JUDAS PRIEST/DEEP PURPLE PRIZE PACKAGE    Josh Homme's band has had one of the coolest guest lists of any band, ever. Elton John, ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, Trent Reznor, Shirley Manson of Garbage, PJ Harvey, Dave Grohl and Mark Lanegan are among those who have contributed to Queens albums. And Rob Halford is on that list also. Ironically, he sang backing vocals on ""Feel Good Hit of the Summer."" Here are the song's lyrics: ""Nicotine, valium, vicadin, marijuana, ecstasy, and alcohol... c-c-c-cocaine!"" Rob was sober for well over a decade when he appeared on this track. It’s no secret that Rob Halford is a big Black Sabbath aficionado, so it was no surprise to hear him on the Sabbath tribute album, Nativity In Black. Assembled for one song, the Bullrung Brummies featured the Priest frontman, Sabbath bassist and drummer Geezer Butler and Bill Ward, Fight guitarist Brian Tilse, Saint Vitus axeman (and frontman) Wino and a harmonica player named Jimmy Wood. Halford proved why he was the perfect man to fill in for Dio at a Sabbath gig two years earlier, and for Ozzy a decade later. Rob also lent his voice to a new rendition of Rainbow’s “Man On The Silver Mountain” from the 2014 tribute to Dio, This Is Your Life. This is the better cover, however. This was an unusual Rob Halford guest slot in that he was not singing or screaming in his usual style but snarling in a way that complimented the style of Five Finger Death Punch frontman Ivan Moody. Moody tackled the first verse, Halford the second, and the two joined forces on the second and third choruses. “Lift Me Up” is a straightforward, barnstorming FFDP anthem, and the two singers clearly had fun sparring behind the mic. After pop stars lent their voices to aid African famine relief with “We Are The World,” Ronnie James Dio decided that the heavy metal community could also contribute to the cause, counteracting the popular belief that the metal world was all about self-absorbed hedonism and angry rebellion. The sheer amount of talent in one room was incredible – vocalists like Dio, Geoff Tate of Queensryche, and Paul Shortino of Rough Cutt; guitarists including George Lynch of Dokken, Neal Schon of Journey(!), Brad Gillis of Night Ranger and Adrian Smith and Dave Murray from Iron Maiden, among others. One highlight was the appearance of Rob Halford, who not only sang a couple of key lyrics but soared above the harmonies of the second chorus. Arguably the best Krokus album, Headhunter, was produced by Priest studio master Tom Allom at the end of 1983. Thus, Rob Halford was enlisted to contribute harmonies with Krokus frontman Marc Storace to the chorus of this raucous rocker; their voices sound great together, it's too bad they didn't do more. Rob pulled a similar trick the next year when appearing on the Surgical Steel demo “Smooth and Fast” and in 1992, when providing background screams for Ugly Kid Joe’s “Goddamn Devil."" The original singer and founder of Judas Priest has revived his career over the last two decades by revisiting and re-recording Priest tracks from their early days while tossing in a few originals. His 1998 album Victim Of Changes, included contributions from the late Priest drummer Dave Holland (after he left the band, but before he was incarcerated), including a full version of “Caviar and Meths,” which only emerged as a gentle instrumental extract to close out their debut album. Last year, though, Priest bassist Ian Hill made a guest appearance on another Atkins’ re-recording: “Winter” from Rocka Rolla. This new arrangement featured an extended guitar solo and offered a rare, non-Priest appearance by Hill. In This Moment's ""Black Wedding"" was a straight-up duet between frontwoman Maria Brink and Rob Halford, and makes a good argument that there should be more male-female metal duets. It also makes a great argument that Brink and Halford should do a full album together. How did Priest axeman Glenn Tipton wind up appearing on a song by minor grunge outfit the Nixons? The answer is clearly producer Mark Dodson, who was behind the boards for The Nixons' album Foma and who co-produced Glenn Tipton's two solo albums in the mid-1990s, one of which, Edge Of The World, did not surface until 2006. The ferocious soloing at the beginning, middle, and end of “Drink The Fear” totally sounds like '90s Tipton, and it adds welcome color to an otherwise typical grunge track of the time. After Glenn Tipton became friends with sexy singer and model Samantha Fox when they were both living in Spain, she invited him to add a solo to an upbeat pop track on her fourth solo album Just One Night. Tipton's agile fingerwork amped up an otherwise lightweight track. It's a really good, melodic solo that's somewhat out of place, but it makes for a fun contrast. Plus, anytime you get to hear great Tipton playing is a good thing, and the whole collaboration will make you smirk, in a good way. The duo allegedly wrote some songs together, but we’ll likely never hear them. Bassist Mick Cervino is a former member of Yngwie Malmsteen’s band and Blackmore’s Night. One of the rare producing efforts from original Priest guitarist K.K. Downing, Violent Storm's debut album featured two solos from Downing, on “War No More” and “Deceiver” (the latter, funnily enough, was also a Judas Priest song title from 1976, but it's not the same song). Of these two trad metal tunes, the fast-paced former track was the more exciting, with Downing delivering a searing, squealing solo that had his signature all over it. As with the Tipton tracks above, it was nice to hear K.K. shred in a different context. After Geoff Tate's acrimonious split from the Seattle prog metal icons that he fronted for three decades, he released the album Frequency Unknown (""FU,"" get it?) featuring a sizable list of guest musicians that included Rudy Sarzo, Simon Wright, Paul Bostaph, Ty Tabor, Brad Gillis, Dave Meniketti, Chris Poland, and departed Priest guitarist K.K. Downing. Many people understandably complained about the poor mixing job on the album, which resulted in it being remixed and reissued. Downing's solo on “Running Backwards” actually appeared on the 2014 remix version and replaced the original one from the 2013 edition. (We're not sure who played that one.) At any rate, Downing ripped into an aggressive solo that added flair to an otherwise average metal tune. Rob Halford made a funny cameo in the Jonas Åkerlund film Spun back in 2002. He played a porn store clerk who angers Mickey Rourke’s character by flirting with him. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912206677.94/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326220507-20190327002507-00137.warc.gz

Look, we’ve only got so much time to spare, so we narrowed this Loud List down to some of the most publicized and strangely celebrated arrests in rock history. Guns N’ Roses might have the all-time record for most riots started by a rock band. In 1991, Axl Rose faced four misdemeanor assault charges following a destructive night in St. Louis. A year later, Rose was arrested to face those charges, but according to the singer, he spent more time signing autographs and talking about rock and roll with the cops. Remember when Paul McCartney was arrested in Japan? The Beatles legend was busted at Tokyo’s Narita International Airport for bringing roughly half a pound of marijuana into the country. His arrest was caught on film and the musician spent nine days in jail. However, the father of Linda McCartney was a high powered lawyer, and following international pressure from fans, Japan decided to take it easy on Macca. This list wouldn’t be complete without the inclusion of Ozzy Osbourne. There are more than a few arrests we could point out for this list, but we chose the most lighthearted one — the Alamo whizzing incident. Wearing one of his wife’s green evening dresses, a wasted Ozzy took to public urination without a care in the world.

180,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/11-metal-songs-inspired-by-dantes-inferno/,"“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.” The idea of hell is rather terrifying. Suffering in flames for all of eternity is the stuff of which nightmares are made. However, Italian poet Dante somehow manages to make the standard version of Catholic hell look like child’s play compared to the way he illustrates the dark beyond in his epic poem, ""Inferno."" ""Inferno"" is the first and most renowned part of Dante’s ""Divine Comedy"" trilogy, which also includes ""Purgatorio"" and ""Paradiso."" The poet details a terrifying journey through the nine circles of hell, with each layer more brutal than the last. Starting in the first circle, which is limbo, each succeeding realm exists to punish certain crimes and sins; lust, gluttony, greed, wrath, heresy, violence, fraud, and treachery. He is the only living soul permitted to enter the underworld and is accompanied by the Roman poet Virgil, who guides him through the horrors. What makes Dante’s detailing of hell so unique is that he blends concepts from Greek mythology and modern Catholicism. This might be to lend more credibility to the forgotten polytheism of ancient times. Or it could be an attempt to present Catholicism as fictitious mythology itself. Either way, the combination of both theologies creates a true horror story, invoking genuine fear of what might await for us when we cross into the beyond. Many metal musicians have incorporated Dante’s “nine circle” template and epic storytelling style into their own music.

186,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/11-unforgettable-motley-crue-moments/,"For nearly 35 full years, Motley Crue existed as rock and metal's most infamous band. Through nine studio albums, millions of record sold and more partying than any of us can conceive, here are 11 Unforgettable Motley Crue Moments. After a full throwback commercial for Motley Crue's Dr. Feelgood album, we travel to 1984 and Crue's appearance at the Monsters of Rock Festival in Donington, England. This is the famous scene where Nikki Sixx bashes Tommy Lee's head into a table repeatedly before answering the question of whether dollars bills go ""in the bank or up the nose."" One moment that became rock folklore is the occasion where Ozzy Osbourne took on Nikki Sixx in a gross-out contest. After Nikki and Ozzy snorted lines of ants, Ozzy defeated Crue's bassist by drinking his own piss. Snorting ants sounds dangerous, but it's nothing compared to the drugs Crue would put into their bodies. Nikki Sixx overdosed a total of six times, including one heroin episode that left him legally dead for minutes. Remember when Tommy Lee went back to college? The VH1 reality show gave us some great moments, including a time when Lee had to dissect a frog. Nikki Sixx and Mick Mars also appeared on some reality TV in their day, notably on LA Ink when Sixx got Mars' portrait tattooed on his leg. The video ends at Motley Crue's final performance on New Year's Eve 2015, when Tommy Lee's flying drum coaster got stuck upside down and Vince Neil shed some farewell tears.

187,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/11-vicious-songs-attacking-the-music-industry/,"With musicians only taking home 12 percent of the music industry billions made each year, it’s no surprise that frustration has been channeled into song by many rock and metal legends. These tracks take on the music industry, throwing away the concept of “don’t shit where you eat.” Punk rock has run the anti-industry gamut for decades, with the Sex Pistols becoming infamous for calling out one record label in particular — EMI. Following the band’s expletive-laden appearance on Grundy, EMI dropped the Sex Pistols, perhaps caving to media outrage. Turned out to be their loss, as Virgin released the explosive Never Mind the Bullocks to massive success. Following The Dark Side of the Moon, you’d think Pink Floyd would be untouchable, right? Nope. Music industry greed only tightened around Pink Floyd as the band readied their 1975 album, Wish You Were Here. There are plenty of anti-industry messages to be found in Wish You Were Here, including the extremely blunt “Have a Cigar.” There’s no mistaking lyrics like “We heard about the sell out / You’re gonna get an album out” and “We call it ‘riding the gravy train.’” How ironic is it that Korn’s “Y’all Want a Single” was actually used as a single? During the recording of 2004’s Take a Look in the Mirror, Epic Records felt like a hit single hadn’t yet been written. Jonathan Davis responded a middle finger their way, fitting “fuck” into “Y’All Want a Single” a total of 89 times.

You can say they sold out or went soft, but they all became ridiculously popular after moving away from their rock sound. You wouldn’t even recognize half these artists if we didn’t name them. Did you know Maroon 5 used to be called Kara’s Flowers? Jumping around in their plaid shirts, colored hair and ripped jeans, Kara’s Flowers came from the school of Nirvana and Soundgarden. Some early footage of the band has surfaced on YouTube, and you won’t believe that people used to mosh to what became Maroon 5. Before “Iris” and “Black Balloon” gave Goo Goo Dolls and 4x platinum album, Johnny Rzeznik and the boys were a punk rock band that ripped dirty ass solos, and they were signed to Metal Blade Records. They definitely performed one of the biggest 180s in this list, but you can’t blame them for trying a radio friendly sound, as they went from ratty bar band to international headliners. Oh Gwen, what on earth happened to you? Stefani used to be ska-punk’s princess, but she traded her Cons for glass slippers. Even after No Doubt went pop, Stefani went deeper into the world of glitz with her solo career, which includes unforgivable abominations like “Hollaback Girl.” Bradley Nowell would have been pissed.

Of course, covering Nine Inch Nails’ “Hurt” turned Cash into an even greater icon. If you know anything about rock ’n’ roll, you know that Queen are gods of the artform. No truer arena rock has ever been created, with Freddie Mercury reigning as the greatest frontman to ever hit a stage. Their “Stone Cold Crazy” was a legitimate precursor to the speed of thrash. Show me a music fan who doesn’t love Bob Marley and we’ll show you a human with no soul. Like much of metal’s greatest artists, Marley was fiercely anti-war and brilliant lyrically.

190,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/13-unforgettable-slayer-moments/,"Last week, Slayer delivered the news of their impeding retirement following a 2018 farewell tour. To pay our respects to the heaviest ‘Big Four’ band, we’ve put together these 13 Unforgettable Slayer Moments. When Slayer began in 1981, their intention was to be the most extreme metal band on earth. They succeeded, despite the fact that frontman Tom Araya had no idea what metal was when he was recruited to join Slayer. In a vintage interview, Araya describes how Kerry King introduced him to the genre, spinning vinyl from a little band called Iron Maiden. You’ll see plenty of Jeff Hanneman footage in this compilation, as Slayer’s primary riff master was the driving force behind the band’s malevolent leads. Along with live footage of Hanneman crushing “Raining Blood” and “World Painted Blood” live, you’ll see interview footage of the six-string master describing why he prefers club gigs to arenas and stadiums. We also included part of Kerry King’s speech at Hanneman’s 2013 public memorial service. Of course, we couldn’t forget drumming colossus Dave Lombardo, who served Slayer during the band’s most creatively prosperous periods. We used one of our own ‘Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?’ segments to showcase Lombardo explaining how he met Kerry King when the guitarist was mowing his lawn. We also couldn’t let this list go by without including Lombardo’s sickest drum break ever… you know the one.

191,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/13-year-old-guitar-prodigy-winter-olympics-closing-ceremony/,"The Winter Olympics are finished, but one more star was made during last night’s Closing Ceremony. 13-year-old guitar prodigy Yang Tae-Hwan took to the world’s stage to shred a piece of Vivaldi’s “Four Seasons.” People flipped out to Tae-Hwan’s incredible playing and his prowess. The Olympics had been tinged with rock twice, with a figure skating duo performing a routine to Disturbed’s “The Sound of Silence” cover and a solo figure skater turning heads with an AC/DC run while wearing leather and an Angus Young back patch. As for Tae-Hwan, he first rose to prominence on South Korean TV talent show Star King. Since 2013, the young shredder has been uploading videos onto his YouTube channel, with his most successful clip showcasing a masterful cover of Dream Theater’s “The Best of Times.” Yang Tae-Hwan also released his own album in 2015, at the age of 10. Like with most Olympics footage, it’s tough to find full pro-shot clips of anything, but NBC tweeted out a 30-second clip of Yang Tae-Hwan, which got everyone who didn’t catch the Closing Ceremony live on TV. The tiny axemaster played a section of the “Winter” portion of the “Four Seasons,” backed up by an orchestra and an army of dancers. It was quite the spectacle, as the guitarist did his thing right under the Olympic flame.

192,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/14-album-covers-look-metal-but-arent/,"Since heavy metal was first pressed onto vinyl in the early 1970s, the music has been inextricably linked with its album art. Fans seeking for something heavy, brutal or a bit dangerous often relied on word of mouth, record reviews, and intuition to pick from the haystack of emerging metal bands. Just as significant was the image on the album cover. Of course, there were key core art elements to good metal: blood, Satanic or occult content, violence, sci-fi themes, explosions, studs and leather, nudity and psychedelic themes. Before the dawn of the interweb, such criteria led many ‘80s headbangers to great albums by groups including Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Metallica and countless others. Along the way, however, fans occasionally got tripped up by records that looked totally “metal” but didn’t live up to their expectations. Either they weren’t as heavy as their cover art suggested, they were just bad or they were put out by bands from an entirely different genre. Below are the some of the most deceptive album covers that either left metal fans scratching their heads or were too ridiculous to be taken seriously.

193,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/14-metal-songs-that-arent-ballads-for-the-lonely-brokenhearted/,"Buddy, we're on your side. Valentine's Day is a totally corporate powered holiday in order to part you from your money. Candy companies want you to buy up-charged boxes of chocolates, restaurants are trying to make you spend more on menus, it's all terrible. So if on V-Day you're alone or mid-breakup, we don't want you to feel bad. Whether it's not having a date, the cutie on the elevator catching your eye, or a relationship ending in the worst possible season (i.e. this one), we've got a playlist for you. This may come as a surprise to you, but metal musicians sometimes get upset over people and relationships (note: major sarcasm folks). It's a common theme that tracks across nearly every subgenre of metal, and, as such, we've done our best to include a wide representation of heartache. Best of all? No corny emo wallowing or ballads in sight! Kick back, wallow, and jam these 14 Metal Songs That Aren't Ballads for the Lonely + Brokenhearted. The vocal stylings of Ronnie James Dio lend themselves pretty excellently to most heartfelt emotion, heartbreak feeling extremely natural to his performance. ""Straight Through The Heart"" from Holy Diver matches up the musicality of the band with a vocal performance that sounds very real. It takes what was probably a pretty straight up relationship that didn't work out, but with Dio's delivery on ""straight through the HEART!"" it becomes a Shakespearian level tragedy. ""Oh, never tell a secret with your eyes/ It's the eyes that let you down /Tell a little truth with many lies / It's the only way I've found Oh, here it comes again / Straight to your heart / Right in the middle of your heart"" Not all of us are tender, and not all of us want schmaltz. If you feel like you're an outsider, imagine if you were an interdimensional being and forced to listen to every dreadful pop song ever created. Such is the struggle of GWAR, thoroughly expressed in the accurately titled ""Hate Love Songs."" Combining a little bit of heavy metal and hardcore punk, GWAR take a shot at the entire conception of love and its participants. Especially you. ""I hate love songs and I hate lovers / I hate everything that I can't have so I hate you / I hate love songs and I hate lovers / I hate everything that I can't have so I hate you"" The high stakes romanticism of HIM's ""love metal"" obviously tackles the other side of passion. ""Heartache Every Moment"" shows the band casting a spell of pop-goth, packing its instrumentation with an undeniably catchy hook. Ville Vallo's lyrics bemoan a relationship doomed to fail. Guitars are distorted and smooth, a great singalong by the band. ""Oh it's heartache every moment / From the start till the end / It's heartache every moment with you / Deeper into our heavenly suffering / Our fragile souls are falling / It's heartache every moment / Baby with you"" When you've got a reputation like Motley Crue did in the 80s, you're going to be dealing with all sorts of relationships (some more fleeting than others). ""Too Young to Fall in Love"" explores heartache from a different perspective than what's usually seen in rock music. Vince Neil is fully aware of his reputation, and that it's the worst possible time to settle down with another woman. It's a rare moment of clarity and responsibility in hair metal, and a catchy tune to boot. ""Well now I'm killing you / Watch your face turning blue/ Not yet a man / Just a punk in the street/Too young to fall in love Run for the hills / We're both sinners and saints / Not a woman but a whore/I can just taste the hate"" The downtuned gloom and doom of My Dying Bride's metal is the perfect sea to sink into when you're feeling at your wits end when it comes to a relationship. ""Loves Intolerable Pain"" creates an atmosphere of suffocating guitar work, leaving listeners facing off with the solemn lyrical questions posed by vocalist Aaron Stainthorpe. The song explores misery's aura, before ramping up in its latter half for a more active take on sadness. What if love's intolerable pain never leaves? / What will your life's mark leave upon this world? / What now, will my dark craft do with your body now? / We walk as Gods together through a fiery dawn Finnish gothic metal band Sentenced know a thing or two about heart break, ""No More Beating As One"" being a perfect example of the feeling. It's the first step the band took in moving away from melodeath, and results in a pretty sweet track. The lyrics are thoroughly dramatic, its metaphors likening break up to straight up death and suicide to breakup. It's a solid song to get out the most over thee top aspects of loneliness and ""Gone are the times when I felt alive / Gone are those nights with you by my side / And now here I stand as the shadows grow deep… / With the death on my hand at your grave I weep"" In the middle of the chaos The Dillinger Escape Plan conjures up is a core strength of very vulnerable emotion. ""One of Us Is The Killer"" is a slow burn, the band starting off quiet while Greg Puciato croons. Musically it's full of melancholy and just a twinge of sinister forces at play. The music ramps up to a crushing bridge, ending in an emotional loop. ""In the air we tried to be but you shot your arrow through me / Now one of us must die, but the killer won’t survive"" One of Voivod's greatest strengths is the band's ability to work in both the fantastical and the very real. ""Fix My Heart"" off of their 1993 The Outer Limits is some of the band's most inspired material following the heights set by preceding albums Dimension Hatross and Nothingface. The song manages to both be very vulnerable lyrically as well as upbeat and fun, resulting in a breakup jam you'll want to hear even when you're in a good mood. ""Tell me now what do you read in my hand? / Please don't spell me wrong / What is going on?"" What happens when the entire world is weighing on you to save the princess when you're not able to feel human whatsoever? Sonata Arctica's ""Kingdom for a Heart"" posits this scenario, as it turns a time held trope on its head. The narrator in this song is still regretful over his emotions, as he'd give anything to engage in love like others can in his scenario, the drama bolstered by the high stakes of the lyricism. ""What the hell am I waiting here for, expecting you to
come and give away your life / Just for a moment of my time, have a hole where I should have a heart / I'm made of wood, I'm falling apart / I would give a kingdom for one more day."" Steel Panther. Heartbreak. You know what you're getting yourself into with these lyrics: ""Oh yeah / That you gotta stop fucking / Gotta stop fucking / Gotta stop fucking / Fucking my heart in the ass / Won't you please stop fucking my heart in the ass/ Oh won't you please stop fucking my heart"" Skid Row know a thing or two about being with women, but they know more than anything they ""Can't Stand the Heartache."" The lyrics do spend most of their time being upset at the cyclical process of meeting women and getting your heart broken, but through the sadness of this experience Sebastian Bach comes to the conclusion that it's going to be okay, and that time will indeed heal things. ""Can't stand the heartache / So bleeds the red, red rose / Time heals a broken heart / But that's just the way it goes / Can't stand, can't stand the heartache"" Converge's crown jewel of an album Jane Doe deals by and large with a relationship dissolving, and ""Heaven In Her Arms"" is a great singular piece from the larger work of art. Jacob Bannon's vocals are obscured (in a lot of the band's work admittedly), letting the pure anger and passion he feels take over for legibility, leading the song to full crush. ""Three simple words bled me dry / Three simple words bled us dry, bled us dry / I love you"" Killswitch Engage's 2004 title track ""The End of Heartache"" is deceptively clever in its lyrical approach. The song is introduced by Howard Jones' faint calls of ""seek me, call me"" which are later put in the context of the rest of his words, rewriting meaning entirely. It's both waiting for the person on the other end of a call, as well as for a feeling to dissipate. It proved the band is in good hands with Jones, and that he's able to key into vulnerability in a sincere way. ""(Seek me) For comfort, (Call me) For solace/ (I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart / (Seek me) Completion, (Call me) I'll be waiting / (I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart"" Devin Townsend has no problem getting serious or ridiculous, and ""Love?"" remains one of the band's biggest achievements in terms of blending heaviness with accessibility. The song is backed up by an infectious groove, matched with Townsend tearing up his vocals in an attempt to communicate the song's stakes. It succeeds and is still one of their most popular singles. ""I’ll wait for the night to come / So far, suicide at home / For I’m not the man you know / This love, it's about control"" ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202474.26/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320230554-20190321012554-00474.warc.gz

Even the greatest bands have released a dud or two, but some bands have gotten it right every time. We’ve expanded our old Top 10 list to an updated list of 15 incredible acts. The longest streak on this list belongs to Opeth, with 12 full-length albums achieving incredible artistic feats. Though some fans lamented Opeth’s change in direction with Heritage, the album still got good reviews and set the stage for Pale Communion and Sorceress, thus we can’t possibly label it a stinker. The 21st century kings of consistency are Mastodon, having released modern classic after modern classic since Remission in 2002. Seven albums and two EPs into a career, Mastodon have never shown a hint of weakness, even when experimenting with bizarre concepts or toning things down a straight rock ’n’ roll approach. Though some of these bands have only put out a few albums, the impact still being felt is worth adding them to this list. Tool’s four studio albums and one EP are still selling out arenas, while Rage Against the Machine’s three albums of originals and one covers album would be filling stadiums if the band was still around.

The year provided a rebound for one of rock's top acts of the '90s, a welcome fresh start by a band attempting to continue after the death of their iconic voice and a supergroup that left their mark with one, and only one, album.

These 15 bands all placed a killer closer at the end of iconic albums, and we’re shouting them out for it. Many Iron Maiden fans will point to “Hallowed Be Thy Name” as the band’s greatest song, and it’s the final track on The Number of the Beast. It was the NWOBHM band’s first true epic, which is now a staple of each Dickinson-era Maiden album. You could essentially fill this list with Iron Maiden closers, but we had to choose the fan favorite for this list. Slayer mastered the art of both opening and closing on Reign in Blood. As if the thrash icons could get any heavier with “Angel of Death,” the boys saved “Raining Blood” for the album’s grand finale. Fans may point to Metallica as the greatest thrash band in history, but they’ve got no closer like “Raining Blood” in their entire catalogue. Getting into more modern metal, System of a Down capped off Toxicity with one of their most perfect tracks. “Aerials” was the best choice possible to end SOAD’s 2001 album, moody and gorgeous with a giant main riff. It may not be the title track, but “Aerials” defines Toxicity just as much as any other song. Check out our picks for the 15 Greatest Album Closers in Metal History in the Loud List above.

The first track on an album completely sets the pace, and if you can capture someone’s attention with a monster opener, you’ll keep them around until the album’s final moments. Slayer have always opened their albums with crushing modern classics. “War Ensemble” launching Seasons in the Abyss and South of Heaven leading with its title track are iconic moments in thrash, but “Angel of Death” is the ultimate Slayer opener. The Reign in Blood kickoff is relentless and is often cited as the first “extreme metal” song. Ozzy Osbourne has always made huge first impressions with Black Sabbath, his solo career and even his private life. Sabbath’s first album kicks off with “Black Sabbath” — arguably their most definitive song and the arrival of heavy metal itself. We also made sure to show some love to Jake E. Lee and his Ozzy Osbourne band introduction, “Bark at the Moon.” Moving into the 21st century, Mastodon have taken opening tracks in stride, using them to kick off epic stoner tales on Leviathan, Blood Mountain and Crack the Skye.

198,loudwire.com,rock,https://loudwire.com/15-greatest-bass-intros-of-all-time/,"Without a solid rhythm section, your favorite bands would not exist. We recently paid our respects to the greatest drum intros of all time, so let’s get to the other rhythmic anchors in rock and metal — the bassists. This list wouldn’t be worth a damn without Cliff Burton’s iconic lead on Metallica’s “For Whom the Bell Tolls.” Not only is it one of the best bass leads ever, it’s one of the best metal riffs, period. Since Burton died at the young age of 24, there isn’t much quality footage of him ripping the lead, but this one clip has become iconic amongst Metallica fans. Where would heavy metal be without Steve Harris? The Iron Maiden bassist / songwriter has taken the lead in many NWOBHM classics over the years, but our pick for this list is “Wrathchild.” Harris has made his bass the focal point of Maiden songs like “The Clairvoyant” and “Children of the Damned,” but we chose the perennial Killers track to represent Harris and his four-string prowess. If it wasn’t for Mike Starr’s bass line during the opening of “Would,” the bleak Alice in Chains cut wouldn’t assert the same weight onto the listener. It’s cold, gloomy and forms like a black cloud with each play. Jerry Cantrell and Layne Staley’s duel vocals carry the track, but that bass intro sets the stage for a truly heavy piece.

Whenever monster bass shredders come up, Dream Theater’s John Myung will always be in the conversation. As an original member of DT, Myung has melted his fretboard for 13 studio albums, but our choice for his best solo is “The Dance of Eternity.” The Metropolis Pt. 2 cut is absolutely stunning, especially as Myung’s runs are punctuated by the drums and guitar. Between the Buried and Me transformed from metalcore mavens to prog gods with the release of 2007’s Colors. A track dedicated almost entirely to the bass, “Viridian” is set up to showcase Dan Briggs’ surgical precision and highly emotional compositions. One of BTBAM’s aims is to emulate bands like Pink Floyd, and like the solo to “Comfortably Numb,” the “Viridian” bass solo says much more than a vocal part ever could. You’ll see plenty of tech death in this list.
